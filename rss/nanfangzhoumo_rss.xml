The dating consultant asked him to find out that he was a manager of a private enterprise, with an annual income of 400,000+, and that he had a house, a car and no loans, so he recommended a dating service with a price of 70,000, and even said to him: For a high-income person like you, 70,000 is not enough. It&#39;s not a high price, but we can provide emotional services. Then he pulled up two resumes with specific information concealed from his mobile phone. Both of them had a photo of a beautiful woman. He told him that both beauties had paid membership fees of N million, and their requirements were very suitable for his situation. As long as Once he joins the association, he can immediately arrange to meet and get to know each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But his psychological price is less than 10,000. He said that 70,000 yuan was an unaffordable price for him. Seeing that he was about to get up and leave, the dating consultant said in a very disdainful tone, &quot;What we are talking about now is your life-long event. If you yourself feel that you are not worth tens of thousands of dollars, then there is nothing we can do.&quot; The dating consultant also emphasized that , &quot;Many of our members have paid membership fees of hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands a year, but I didn&#39;t mention it to you considering your income level.&quot; He replied, not thinking that his life event is not worth 70,000, but just I feel that this kind of service is not worth 70,000 yuan. As for hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands, only XX would spend such a big sum of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days later, the dating consultant called him and said in a familiar and friendly manner that if paying 70,000 at once was too much, the website could provide installment payments and discounts. He also recommended other packages, but he hung up the phone directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar scenes have been exposed by the media for a long time: the target is locked in a room for two to three hours for brainwashing, and is required to pay tens of thousands of yuan in membership fees; after registration, harassment calls are received from various numbers Phone call; after registering, you were invited to go to the offline store, but after paying the money, your attitude was perfunctory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen said that in his opinion, spending tens of thousands of yuan to buy a blind date service is a bit ridiculous. It was not until he saw someone actually posting a blind date service bill of 32,000 yuan that he felt that he was short-sighted. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is not that he is short-sighted, but that in the face of the powerful words and targeted bombing sales of some dating websites, some people will eventually be unable to defeat him. In March 2022, The Paper reported that through phone calls and WeChat, a marriage agency claiming to be from the &quot;MarryU Club high-end membership club&quot; continued to promote &quot;high-end marriage consulting services&quot; to Ms. Guo in Beijing, and promised to be able to provide services during the service period. Help her find the right match. Ms. Guo came to an offline physical franchise store on the platform and signed a 480-day membership service contract and supplementary agreement worth nearly 170,000 yuan. It was agreed that a company in Hangzhou would entrust a consulting and management company in Beijing to perform contract services and promised to provide Ms. Guo with a customized version of &quot;marriage hunting services.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;News reports tell us that the lady’s 170,000 yuan was wasted. During the follow-up service process, Ms. Guo discovered that the identity of the men provided for appointments on the platform was questionable, and some had discrepancies in age and workplace information. Some did not even leave their WeChat or contact information after meeting. “Even if they were added, (the other party) would not No reaction.&quot; While the contract was in effect, Ms. Guo met her current husband in an accidental private social interaction, and the two received their marriage certificate in December 2021. After the marriage, Ms. Guo thought she could return a certain percentage of the service fee, but was rejected by the matchmaking agency on the grounds that she violated the contract by &quot;marrying a candidate who was not recommended by the agency.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think what happened to Ms. Guo is just an accident, you are totally wrong. Data show that in the first half of 2019, the Jucomplaint platform received a total of 1,686 valid complaints from consumers across the country regarding the dating and dating industry. In the current period, 993 complaints were confirmed to have been resolved, with a resolution rate of 58.9%. Judging from the types of complaints, they mainly include exaggerated service effects and difficulty in refunding. To put it bluntly, some dating platforms are playing tricks on you, and they don’t care about the wine but your wallet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the folk, &quot;matchmaker&#39;s words&quot; have long been the driving force for young people to come together. Theoretically, a dating website is a &quot;virtual matchmaker&quot;, but in reality, this &quot;virtual matchmaker&quot; often shows characteristics that are contrary to the function of a matchmaker. The most important characteristic of a matchmaker is to use his sharp tongue to facilitate the marriage between a man and a woman as quickly as possible. However, some dating websites are just the opposite. Their core appeal is to try their best to sign a long-term contract. To this end, they delay and consume all kinds of things until the contract is due. Period, make a lot of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of paying a large membership fee is to find high-quality men and women, but a disturbing problem is that on some dating websites, there are really high-quality men and women waiting for you, and you only need to pay enough to find the right one. Object? In fact, you can know the answer just by looking at the logic lines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, high-quality men and women have long been robbed of their heads. Do they still need to go to a blind date platform? It is said that some platforms have a large number of high-quality men and women, and after paying the money, it is yours. Is this a joke? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you pay a membership fee to a blind date website, you are essentially paying an agency fee. But many times, the agency fee is very strange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of real estate, intermediaries still have &quot;business rules&quot;. They can only charge fees after the house sale is completed, so real estate agents try their best to bring both parties together to reach a deal. However, some dating websites induce eager men and women to spend their money and are irresponsible for the results. They can actually continue to have a prosperous business and have no worries about customer sources. Do they really benefit from the &quot;people are stupid and have more money&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many members of the dating platform spend tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or even hundreds of thousands, which is really no less than the agency fee for buying a house - the &quot;bulk transactions&quot; displayed in this kind of marriage and love market are full of of fantasy and absurdity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some dating platforms engage in the practice of fabricating portraits, deceiving you, and cutting as many leeks as you can. They are despicable and shameless, but they always gain the upper hand with a series of misleading and risk-mitigating techniques. This makes many consumers miserable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who frequently talk to you about money are not just scammers, but also people who engage in &quot;dating tricks&quot;. It is common sense to realize that it is unlikely that a dating website will have high-quality men and women, it is unlikely that you can get &quot;more&quot; by spending more money, and it is unlikely that you will be invincible with the &quot;guidance&quot; of a dating consultant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finding a partner “online” certainly has a certain effect – in fact, I have friends who found true love online, but do I have to find some “professional platform” to find a partner? not necessarily. The aforementioned Ms. Guo signed a contract but found the right person outside the platform. This &quot;accident&quot; that slapped the platform in the face fully demonstrates that hot life scenes are the &quot;incubation&quot; base for relationships. Sometimes, when you can&#39;t find a partner, it&#39;s not because you haven&#39;t entered the &quot;professional platform&quot;, but because your effective social circle is not large enough, or in other words, you are not deep enough in the ocean of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you really can&#39;t meet the right person on your own, then use your parents, relatives, friends, and colleagues to exert energy and accumulate opportunities, and at the same time try to expand your private social circle and personal media display circle to open up opportunities for yourself. The door to marriage and love is still a trustworthy path. At least, if you take this path, your wallet will not be hurt, your armor will be thrown away, and you will have nowhere to complain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[更能提供情绪价值？网购冲击下，实体店靠什么活下来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258228]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The rise of e-commerce platforms has had a big impact on offline shopping. Coupled with the increase in consumption in recent years, After downgrading, many users, including me, have to shop around online before placing an order, and even start shopping on some platforms that are famous for their low prices, and they still find it really delicious. With such an unstoppable consumer trend, I thought that physical stores would definitely not be able to open. However, after observing my parents’ consumption behavior, I understood how physical stores can maintain a competitive advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My hometown has a newly built self-built house with many rooms and toilets, so there is no one-time renovation. I took advantage of the e-commerce shopping festival to buy a bathroom cabinet for the restroom. This is the product I ordered after reading countless posts on how to choose bathroom ware online. After it was delivered to my hometown, I made an appointment with the installer, and nothing went wrong in the process. The only question came from my dad. In addition to expressing his dissatisfaction with the price, he also asked me a soul-searching question: &quot;Why don&#39;t you go to a store near home to buy it? I know you, it will be easier to repair in the future.&quot; I can&#39;t answer this question, because The reason for online shopping is to pursue cost-effectiveness, but my prices are uncompetitive in front of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I returned to my hometown, my dad couldn’t wait to take me to the bathroom they used and asked me to guess how much the bathroom cabinet in front of me cost. I said I couldn’t guess, “500 yuan!” With a proud look on his face, I could even see his inner monologue: &quot;See if I&#39;m very good. Online shopping is just a cloud!&quot; He explained to me: &quot;This is a sample from the boss&#39;s clearance, and I took it away. &quot;Of course I know that there is a difference between three-no products with nothing and brand-name products. The most direct reflection is the price, but the low price really shocked me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Misfortune never comes singly. After I went home and used the newly installed bathroom cabinet several times, I found that the sink and water pipe connections were not tightened, causing water to seep and drip onto the floor. There was no hexagonal wrench at home, and my dad was sarcastic to me again. If there was something wrong with his bathroom cabinet or water heater, he could just walk a few hundred meters and call someone to repair it, but I could only figure out a solution on my own. So, that bathroom cabinet is still seeping water, and the sound of water dripping on the tiles is my dad’s accusation against me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at it this way, it seems that physical stores rely on price wars to win online shopping. In fact, this is not the case. It’s just that my dad’s consumption concept makes him choose low-priced products. In essence, physical stores still rely on their touchability. The excellent after-sales service earns consumers&#39; dependence and trust on it. What’s even more amazing is that it also allows users to pay by providing emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One summer night, my parents went shopping to enjoy the cool air. When they came back, they brought a water purifier and a staff member. They also carried a complimentary air purifier and juicer upstairs. I was worried that the two elderly people had been deceived, so I quickly dragged my dad aside and asked him what was going on. The thing is that they were &quot;bewitched&quot; and immediately bought a water purifier. The price was less than 5,000 yuan, and it also came with two gifts. The brand is a regular brand, the store is a regular store, and the staff accompanying me also wear polo shirts with the brand logo printed on them. I subconsciously used my mobile phone to open the brand&#39;s online store and looked for the model my dad bought. After searching to no avail, I consulted online customer service. It turned out that the online and offline models were different. I didn’t buy fakes, but looking at the two gifts, I knew they must be expensive. I still don’t understand the reason why wool comes from sheep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My dad is a person who likes petty bargains, but buying a water purifier is not because it is cheap or because of the two gifts, but because the staff really win people&#39;s hearts. They are not robots in online shopping malls that use text to express intimacy. The guy who came to my house to install a water purifier, after being in contact with him for a while, I thought I might not be able to help but pay for him. During the installation process, he patiently explained the knowledge about use and maintenance to my parents. After completion, he was not in a hurry to leave, but opened the packaging of the juicer and demonstrated how to use it. I was standing aside at that time, knowing how to operate the juicer without reading the manual, so he could leave and get off work. But he asked my mother for bananas and milk, put them in the cup, pressed the button, and explained the operation at the same time. The juicer made a sound like an electric drill. My parents stood beside him quietly, watching with smiles. After the juice was finished, he poured two glasses and handed them to my parents. The three of them were talking and laughing. I was at the other end of the living room, watching this scene, and it felt like they were a family of three. Do you think it&#39;s worth the money? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the emotional value that online shopping is difficult to provide. In addition to a large number of middle-aged and elderly people who cannot use smartphones and shop online, there is also a group of people who firmly believe in physical stores and that only tangible products in the store and face-to-face sales staff can bring a sense of security. The e-commerce economy is booming, but many physical stores are not only surviving, but doing well. I think this is also a little bit of the needs of contemporary people who are prone to emotional emptiness. They need companionship, comfort, real touch and face-to-face communication. Only such care can make cold materials have extra value, and can Be willing to pay for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an employee of a state-owned enterprise in Hangzhou, Zhejiang)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Fosse had been carefully preparing for this call for ten years—after all, he had been part of the hot debate about the Nobel Prize in Literature for ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was surprised, but at the same time, in a sense, I wasn&#39;t,&quot; he told Swedish public broadcaster. Fosse promised to drive home carefully. He is the most famous living playwright in the contemporary era and his works have been performed the most. He also writes prose, novels, poetry, children&#39;s literature and translation works. His works have been translated into more than fifty languages. After receiving the Nobel Prize, he complained that there would be no more big prizes to win in the future, &quot;Everything will go downhill from now on!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jorn Fosse was born in 1959 in Haugesund, a small town on the west coast of Norway. De, who made his debut in 1983 with the novel &quot;Red, Black&quot;, began drama creation when he was around 35 years old and completed 40 plays including adaptations in 20 years. According to The New Yorker, after a very successful and busy period working almost exclusively as a playwright, in 2012 Fother converted to Catholicism, gave up drinking, remarried, and rarely wrote plays again, &quot;writing another The idea of ​​a script no longer entertains”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, John Fosse published his most important masterpiece of novels in recent years, &quot;September&quot;. This series of seven novels is written in the form of a monologue, nearly a thousand pages of stream-of-consciousness narration, with sentences never interrupted. According to the New Yorker, the narrator of &quot;Seven Parts&quot; is a painter named Asle, a convert to Catholicism who is mourning the death of his wife Ales. On Christmas Eve, Asler discovers his friend, a painter of the same name, unconscious in a Bergen alley, dying of alcohol poisoning. &quot;Their memories overlap, repeat, and gradually merge into A single voice, a vague consciousness capable of existing in many times and places simultaneously.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After winning the Nobel Prize, Fosse said in an interview that after completing &quot;Seven Parts&quot;, &quot;this announcement was expected to a certain extent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse always insisted on writing in Nynorsk, a language spoken only in the western and central regions of southern Norway. Nynorsk, also known as New Norse, is a written language formed by a linguist who collected dialects from rural areas of Norway in the mid-19th century. Compared to Norway&#39;s other official language, written Norwegian, Nynorsk has a small footprint. In Norway, the first language in which students are taught is supposed to be decided by referendum in each school district, but as of 2016, only 12.2% of primary school students accepted Nynorsk as the main written language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ninosk is a language that Fosse, who was born in the West Coast countryside, learned as a child. He attributed the award to the language itself, which he believed brought a sense of freshness. He is good at turning blank space and silence into speech, and even believes that &quot;Oriental audiences can best understand my works.&quot; Anders Olsen, chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature, mentioned in the Swedish Academy’s biography of Fosse that after completely simplifying the language and dramatic actions, Fosse used the simplest everyday language to touch human anxieties and emotions. uncertainty, and provide a profound experience of proximity to the divine. This brought him extraordinary public recognition and established him as a major innovator of contemporary theatre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anders listed several of Fosse&#39;s writing qualities. One of his key themes is to show, through minimalism and fragmentation, the harrowing transformations of critical moments of indecision. For example, a young mother left her apartment to take out the trash but locked herself out while her children were still inside. She needs to go get help but can&#39;t do that because she can&#39;t abandon her child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fosse presents situations that are immediately recognizable from our own daily lives.&quot; While in the 1995 play &quot;The Name,&quot; a pregnant young girl awaits the father of her unborn child, He was delayed. &quot;A tension is immediately built here due to this sense of uncertainty and the resulting fragmented sentences. Furthermore, these interruptions create a gap between the girl&#39;s desire for a new life with her child and her anxiety about being abandoned by her father Gully.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Death Variation,&quot; a one-act play about a suicidal girl, Fother tells the story backwards from the girl&#39;s death. It is written in brief, staccato language by six nameless people from different eras, both living and dead. The play ends with the girl giving a moving speech from the other side of the grave, expressing a fundamental uncertainty about whether her decision to end her life was the right one. Jon Fosse considers his writing difficult to categorize, &quot;You don&#39;t read my books for the plot. But it&#39;s not because I want to be an incomprehensible writer, I never try to write in a complicated way. I always It’s about writing in a simple and—I hope—profound way.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anders Olsen is the chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature. After the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature was announced, Anders Olson Si received an email from a Southern Weekend reporter as scheduled. He said he was happy to be interviewed and responded within a day. However, he remained tight-lipped on some issues, such as whether the jury&#39;s decision to award the award to Jon Fother went smoothly and whether there were any other strong contenders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is an exclusive interview with Anders Olsen by a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The strongest and deepest emotions are contained in silence and pauses&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past ten years, John Fosse has been regarded as a strong contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. When did his name enter the Nobel committee&#39;s short list? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For confidentiality reasons, I cannot answer this question. All I can say is that Fosse has been is a globally renowned author whose works have been widely translated since the 1990s and have been with us on the theater stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;On what writing qualities does the Swedish Academy pay attention to Jörn· Fother? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Fosse wrote in a wide range of fields. He was a playwright, novelist and poet, especially his scripts and long or short narratives capture our attention. But in all this he was a poet, as he preferred to be called. You can feel it in his language processing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What works of Jon Fother are the main basis for the award? work?

This novel and more of his essays, and of course his highly innovative plays from the 1990s, are decisive for us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From a personal perspective, you like him Which works?

And in his prose, I was completely immersed in &quot;The Septology,&quot; but I especially loved &quot;Morning and Evening,&quot; a book about life written in sparkling and extremely sensitive prose. Short stories of coming and passing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Give voices a special status”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Jon Fosse: &quot;His innovative drama and prose give voice to the ineffable.&quot; Where does the jury think his innovation lies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Fosse is good at using silence, interruption and postponement of action to evoke deep anxiety in people. This is a striking feature of his drama. In his prose, his use of repetition and evocation is more typical. In both cases, something must be expressed that cannot be easily said. Fother does this in a very touching way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The word voice in the award speech , also seems intended to emphasize Fother&#39;s contribution to literary language. How do you see the connection between Fosse&#39;s literary achievements and his use of the Nynorsk language? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is the first Nynorsk-language writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. I think his work should be read in his native language if possible, it has an unpretentious beauty and is not difficult to translate. Compared to written Norwegian, Norway&#39;s other official language, Nynorsk is more traditional, less urban and more closely related to Old Norse. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are reading the Nynorsk version ? Are there any good translations to recommend? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, I read Fosse in Nynorsk, and it is highly recommended. I don&#39;t have much experience with translations, and both Urban Andersson and Lars Andersson&#39;s Swedish translations are excellent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How to understand the &quot;ineffable&quot; in Fosse&#39;s works What does it mean? He introduced his own writing ideas and quoted two sentences, one is Wittgenstein&#39;s &quot;Where there is no words, one must be silent&quot; and the other is Derrida&#39;s &quot;What cannot be said, one can only write&quot;. He thinks the latter is closer to his own ideas. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think both statements can be linked to Fosse&#39;s writing. In Wittgenstein&#39;s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, &quot;unsayable&quot; refers to the realm where we cannot formulate propositions, and it is also the realm where we can call it &quot;true&quot;. But literature, ethics, and religion do not use propositions; they belong precisely to the realm of the unsayable. Derrida does not have the same strict standard of truth as Wittgenstein. On the contrary, his &quot;saying&quot; gives writing a special position, which coincides with Fosse. Paradoxically, Fother&#39;s writing gave voice a special status, especially in his dramatic works. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Eon Fother believes that he has the greatest influence Among his writers are Tarje Wessos, the Austrian poet Georg Trakl and Samuel Beckett, and the ones he most admires are Kafka and Knut. Knut Hamsun. How do you think these writers influenced him? What were Fosse&#39;s own innovations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s hard to give a short answer. Fother has a negative worldview in the Gnostic sense (Gnostic (ancient Greek philosophy, which believes that the material world is evil and can only be saved through &quot;spiritual knowledge&quot;)), which is very close to Beckett. The most important thing is the use of negation and questions. Fosse&#39;s play bears a striking resemblance to Waiting for Godot, but this does not lead him to nihilism. There was in Fosse a faith that Beckett did not have and a kind of passive mysticism, like that of Meister Eckhart, which appears in the Heptalogy. 》 is very obvious. I won’t talk about other writers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“It’s very difficult to give a great Fosse performance”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You think the uniqueness of Fosse&#39;s writing lies in the fact that after completely simplifying language and dramatic actions, he uses simple daily life scenes to express human beings&#39; strongest anxiety and powerlessness. A lot of writers can do this, what’s so special about Fosse? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;A certain strange confidence, almost childlike self-confidence, and a gentle humor in the negativity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the interview after the award, you said you were blessed Ser&#39;s work touches on common human &quot;anxieties, insecurities, and thoughts about life and death.&quot; This is easily reminiscent of the unease that pervades the world. Are there any practical considerations in awarding the award to Fosse at this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You are always influenced by what is happening in the contemporary world, but I don’t think it is the decisive factor.

How is it different from reading a script? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It needs to be pointed out that Fosse&#39;s dramatic works are extremely readable. But this is not always the case. In addition, due to Fosse&#39;s special language and less stage scenery, it is very difficult to give a wonderful Fosse performance on the stage. Please read his work first and then perform your own mental show! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why is the award given to a playwright? Although Jon Fosse is one of the most well-known playwrights in the contemporary theater world, compared with the popular candidates in the eyes of the outside world, such as Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, this choice will not be the same. Will there be some niche? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For us it is of course important to focus on drama. Harold Pinter received this honor over twenty years ago and I think now is the time. Interestingly, Fosse also translated Pinter&#39;s work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2014, Fother accepted an interview with the British &quot;Guardian&quot; &quot;In an interview, he said that the Nobel Prize in Literature is usually awarded to very old writers. &quot;You will get it when it does not affect your writing.&quot; Coincidentally, Fosse rarely writes for the theater now. Last year, he told the New Yorker that he wanted to take a break after writing &quot;Seven Parts&quot; and that he is now very interested in literary translation. Does winning the award at this time confirm his previous views? Is this a &quot;lifetime achievement award&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it can be regarded as a &quot;lifetime achievement award&quot;, just like Peter Handke (2019 Winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature) won the same award. Of course, this isn&#39;t always the case. In both cases, it is also important to note that they achieved great things before winning the award. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This year Chinese writer Can Xue ranked in the British bookmaker Nicer It ranked first in the odds list on the Odds website, attracting enthusiastic attention from the Chinese people.

Recently, based on the remarkable results achieved in the previous work, the crackdown has achieved another major result. 497 telecommunications network fraud suspects were handed over to the Lincang Public Security Bureau in two batches, and 209 telecommunications network fraud suspects were handed over to the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau. Among them, online There are 26 people at large, which has effectively dealt a blow to the arrogance of overseas fraudsters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since September this year, the public security agencies in Xishuangbanna, Pu&#39;er and other places in Yunnan have carried out border police law enforcement cooperation with relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar.

The person was handed over to us. In order to continue to build momentum and advance the crackdown in depth, under the command and deployment of the Yunnan Provincial Public Security Department, the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau further expanded its results. 209 telecommunications network fraud suspects were successfully handed over to us on October 1. At the same time, Lincang Public Security Bureau&#39;s border police law enforcement cooperation has made significant progress. The relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar handed over 497 telecommunications network fraud suspects to us in two batches on September 25 and October 7 respectively. This is another important breakthrough made by the Yunnan public security agencies in border police cooperation, following the Xishuangbanna and Puer public security agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, relevant criminal suspects have been detained by public security organs in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Chongqing and other places involved in the case. The public security organs will thoroughly investigate all the facts of his crimes, and while cracking down on fraud crimes in accordance with the law, they will also dig deep into related crimes such as black and gray products in the country to ensure that the entire chain is cracked down and severely punished in accordance with the law. After continuous and effective crackdowns, 2,317 suspects of telecommunications and cyber fraud in northern Myanmar have been successfully captured and handed over to us, including 23 behind-the-scenes &quot;financiers&quot;, organizational leaders and backbones, and 94 online fugitives, a powerful squeeze This has reduced the living space for overseas fraudsters, and the number of telecom network fraud cases across the country has recently shown a significant downward trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the public security agency stated that the telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar mainly involve fraud types such as bill rebates, fake online investment and financial management, fake reseller logistics customer service, fake online loans, etc. The general public is advised to be careful Be vigilant, enhance your ability to detect and prevent fraud, and beware of being deceived. The public security organs will continue to keep a close eye on telecom network fraud criminal groups in northern Myanmar, continue to deepen border police cooperation, continue to organize special crackdown operations, make every effort to clear out fraud dens, arrest fraud personnel in accordance with the law, continue to expand the results of operations, and resolutely protect the people.

I wrote an article about an interview with a girl who quoted a poem called &quot;The Book of Songs: Biyang&quot; to express her desire to work hard. But there is no poem called &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; in the &quot;Book of Songs&quot;. The forged poem is all homophones. It is written in seemingly elegant words, but when read out it is full of swear words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This editor has probably not done any real interviews or face-to-face conversations. The swearing in this poem is so obvious that you can hear it right away. However, if you think of looking for materials in the Book of Songs, this idea is correct. The function of the &quot;Ode&quot; part in &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; is traditionally believed to be &quot;to describe the beauty and virtue, and to report success to the gods&quot;. Although the gods no longer believe in them today, the Book of Songs is still the highest example of how to declare success, speak solemnly but not rigidly, and be elegant but not pretentious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, although &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; is fake, and it only plays homophonic jokes, it is not considered clever, and it is &quot;joking and sadizing&quot;. But the poem seems to mean one thing, but actually it means another thing. It is also within the cultural context represented by the Book of Songs. There are so-called &quot;changing style&quot; and &quot;changing elegance&quot; in &quot;The Book of Songs&quot;, which pays great attention to this technique. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Daya·Dang&quot; repeatedly emphasized that &quot;King Wen said that he would consult his daughter Yin Shang.&quot; King Wen of Zhou couldn&#39;t help but sigh. What he sighed was the fate of the Shang Dynasty, and then he mentioned Shang Zhou in the poem. The various atrocities committed by the king were listed in detail and criticized repeatedly. The last sentence of the poem is the famous &quot;Yin Jian is not far away, in the time of Queen Xia&quot;. Shang Zhou wanted to know his own ending, and the mirror was at hand, it was Xia Jie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people have always emphasized that Shang Zhou was vilified by the Zhou people. The reason is that subsequent dynasties must vilify the previous dynasty&#39;s subjugated king, otherwise it will not be enough to establish their own legitimacy. It cannot be said that this reason does not exist, but the poem &quot;Dang&quot; was obviously not written for this purpose. This poem was written during the Western Zhou Dynasty. The author was clearly criticizing Shang Zhou, but his actual intention was to criticize King Li of Zhou. Firstly, the artillery fire was not directed at King Li of Zhou Dynasty, but was rebounded by Shang Zhou; secondly, it was not the poet who fired the artillery fire like this, but King Wen of Zhou Dynasty. The foundation of this dynasty was created by King Wen. As a descendant of King Wen, can you still oppose him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Book of Songs&quot; initiated this tradition of borrowing from the past to satirize the present. Confucius especially emphasized to his disciples that they must study &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; carefully. Naturally, later generations of Confucian scholars played this trick very well. Why did Qin Shihuang burn poems and books? Just because &quot;Poetry&quot; is indeed an excellent teaching material that reflects the past and the present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author of &quot;Dang&quot; was probably an important minister in the Western Zhou Dynasty. Traditionally, it is believed that he was Duke Zhaomu who pointed out that &quot;it is better to guard against the people&#39;s mouth than to guard against the river&quot;. At least it is reasonable. Most people can&#39;t talk about such advanced topics, but they also have a technique for venting their resentment through poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who have not read &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; have probably heard that &quot;under the sky, is it the king&#39;s land, and on the shore of the land, is it the king&#39;s ministers&quot;, and then judging based on intuition, they will also think this sentence The majestic praise comes from the official propaganda of the Western Zhou Dynasty. It cannot be ruled out that this sentence was originally propaganda. However, we can read this sentence today because the author of &quot;Xiaoya·Beishan&quot; was a small civil servant in the Zhou Dynasty. These four sentences are followed by two sentences: &quot;Doctors are not equal.&quot; , I am engaged in being an independent scholar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The six sentences strung together mean: The world is the king&#39;s land, and the land is the king&#39;s ministers. The leadership is really unfair, and the burden is heavy on me. ——Xian means more. It probably means that those who are capable work hard, and the boss assigned all the work to the author. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following section of &quot;Beishan&quot; elaborates on how uneven the work of this department is: some people &quot;sleep in bed&quot;, which is a more elegant way of saying &quot;lying down&quot;; some people &quot;don&#39;t know how to call&quot; , no matter how miserable the people are, it’s none of my business, I’ll just do it if I can; some people are “Qi Chi Yan Yang” and will definitely be late for work and will definitely leave early after work; some people are “Zhan Le Drinker” and indulge in drinking and having fun; &quot;Come in and out of the discussion&quot;, and the reason for going to work is to talk loudly. If there are more people like this, the work will naturally be particularly miserable. He &quot;does not do anything extravagantly&quot; and is &quot;miserably afraid of blame.&quot; The more he does, the more blame he will bear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This poem pursues the effect of a majestic slogan that seamlessly connects with the fly camp and the dog dog below. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you turn two pages back in &quot;Beishan&quot;, you will read another song called &quot;Xiao Ming&quot;. ——There is a poem in &quot;The Book of Songs·Daya&quot;, the first sentence is &quot;Mingming is down&quot;, and there is a poem in &quot;Xiaoya&quot;, the first sentence is &quot;Mingming is going to heaven&quot;. So the song in &quot;Daya&quot; is called &quot;Da Ming&quot;, and the song in &quot;Xiao Ya&quot; is called &quot;Xiao Ming&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Ming said: &quot;I have passed away in the past, and the sun and the moon are gone. Will the clouds return? There will be no clouds in the year.&quot; I came to work after the Chinese New Year. When can I go home? In the blink of an eye, It&#39;s the end of the year. &quot;I miss me alone, and I am a common man. I am worried and worried that I will not have enough time.&quot; I miss me alone, and the more things I do, the more busy I am. I feel really sad, and I am afraid that I will never be able to finish my work. &quot;Thinking of our common people, caring deeply for them! Don&#39;t you want to return home? I&#39;m afraid of the punishment and anger.&quot; I miss my family, I really do. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to return home? I&#39;m afraid of this wrath.&quot; Does it mean that I don&#39;t want to go home? I&#39;m afraid of being scolded by my boss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last chapter of &quot;Xiao Ming&quot; especially demonstrates the skill of converting grievances into official language:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sigh, gentlemen, I will never rest in peace.&quot; In fact, it is talking about you stewards Yeah, don&#39;t get too comfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Jing shares your position&quot;, please stay in your position. The implication is that when I report the work and ask you to make a decision, don&#39;t be unable to find someone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The good thing is integrity.&quot; You have to be an upright person. In fact, it means being a kind person and approving what should be approved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;God listens to you, and you will be blessed.&quot; God is also watching you. Don&#39;t make things difficult for others, and you will be rewarded with blessings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, after more than two thousand years, Xiao Ming is still Xiao Ming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国光大集团原党委书记、董事长李晓鹏被“双开”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258279]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 10:07:33&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;With the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission investigated Li Xiaopeng, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Everbright Group Co., Ltd.

However, on September 22, the environmental organization Institute for the Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) released &quot;Suspicious Clouds about the Carbon Neutrality of Apple Products&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Suspicious Clouds&quot;), questioning Apple&#39;s lack of information on the use of clean electricity and carbon offsets for carbon-neutral products. Adequate disclosure and explanation, and failure to push suppliers to disclose factory-level carbon data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, Apple responded to Southern Weekend reporters, promising to share strategies and progress, and responded to some details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;carbon neutral&quot; label has been controversial for a long time. Carbon neutrality simply means that greenhouse gas emissions can be offset. After companies save energy and reduce emissions themselves, they often offset carbon emissions by purchasing “carbon credits” (such as forest carbon sinks). However, recently Nestlé, Gucci, easyJet and other companies have announced their withdrawal from the carbon offset market, and the third-party consulting company Carbon Trust will no longer provide carbon neutral label certification from September 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the controversy is the increasingly common practice of &quot;greenwashing&quot; - companies exaggerating their environmental protection behavior and misleading consumers into believing it is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To prevent greenwashing, many interviewees told Southern Weekend reporters that the key is &quot;openness.&quot; However, there is currently no consensus on the granularity of carbon neutral product information disclosure, and standards need to be unified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Europe has taken the lead. France has put forward mandatory information disclosure requirements for “carbon neutrality”-related publicity. The EU reached a provisional political agreement on September 19, 2023. If it cannot provide proof, &quot;climate neutral&quot;, &quot;nature&#39;s friend&quot;, &quot;biodegradable&quot; and &quot;ecological&quot; Eco)&quot; and other labels will be prohibited. If passed, this agreement will take effect in 2026. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The six industry insiders interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters had relatively consistent views. They both affirmed that Apple’s information disclosure on its first carbon-neutral product is remarkable, and at the same time believed that there is room for improvement. Regarding IPE’s doubts, half of the respondents agreed that Apple needs to further disclose information on clean electricity use and carbon offsets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Apple’s level of data management and disclosure of suppliers leads the world, but it still needs to fully prove whether it has gone all out to achieve product carbon neutrality.” Founder of Climate Futures, &quot;Carbon Neutral&quot; &quot;Times&quot; author Wang Jun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/jM1wpQhW07Op9WGsVGUG1fvHbtcFiggO5v2c38y6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/jM1wpQhW07Op9WGsVGUG1fvHbtcFiggO5v2c38y6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253292&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 12, 2023 local time, the new Apple Watch was on display in California, USA. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What the first carbon neutral product disclosed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;How does Apple Watch become carbon neutral? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year of announcing that its products were carbon neutral, Apple played a creative advertisement called &quot;Mother Nature&quot; at the press conference and on social platforms - Apple CEO Cook and others paid tribute to &quot;Mother Nature&quot; &quot;Mother&quot; reported on environmental protection work. The environmental report of the latest product was also published on the official website, disclosing the carbon footprint of the carbon-neutral Apple Watch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the carbon-neutral model of Apple Watch Ultra 2 as an example: the baseline carbon emission is 63.2kg, and after the carbon emission is reduced by 81%, it is reduced to 12kg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;81% of carbon reduction starts from materials, electricity, transportation and other aspects: the weight of recycled materials accounts for more than 30%; 100% clean electricity is used; 50% and above product logistics are transported by non-air transport. The remaining 12kg of emissions are offset using carbon credits from the Restore Fund project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/hPC956MeD0XOs6ChYcF3UQgWM84eRnMypDAreBcP.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;928&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/hPC956MeD0XOs6ChYcF3UQgWM84eRnMypDAreBcP.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Carbon emission data of Apple Watch Ultra 2 carbon neutral model. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Apple official website, IPE compilation/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter learned from Apple that after drastically reducing product emissions, Apple has to deal with the current situation. High-quality carbon credits based on nature projects will only be used where solutions cannot yet avoid or reduce emissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Han, director of the ESG Center at the China Business School of the University of Hong Kong, told Southern Weekend reporters that Apple has adopted a clear and strict product carbon reduction method, giving priority to reducing the three largest emission sources in the product life cycle - electricity, Materials and Shipping. But he also suggested that Apple could refer to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) requirements for setting corporate net-zero standards, carry out the product carbon neutrality process, and strive to achieve a carbon reduction of no less than 90%. emissions, and then look for ways to offset carbon emissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among various global initiatives related to combating climate change, SBTi is known for its strictness and is consistent with the Paris Agreement&#39;s efforts to achieve a temperature control path of 1.5°C&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/258230&quot;>;&quot;More than 100 companies have been &quot;publicly delisted&quot;. How difficult is it to scientifically reduce carbon emissions? ?》&lt;/a>;)&lt;/span>;. Southern Weekend reporters found out that Apple has also joined SBTi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;81% mentioned that 90% is not without space. Wang Jun told Southern Weekend reporters that although Apple explained its progress in reducing emissions in materials, electricity, and transportation, it lacked comparison with its peers and failed to demonstrate whether it had reached its own emission reduction limits, such as 50% non-air transport. Logistics and 30% recycled materials, why can’t the ratio be higher? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to prove&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;100%&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;use of clean electricity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Apple’s carbon emission reduction path, Clean electricity contributes the most. How to confirm that 100% clean electricity is used in the production process of Apple products is the first question of &quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data collected by IPE through different channels show that some of Apple’s suppliers’ carbon emissions have only declined slightly, while some are even still growing. &quot;Suspicion&quot; raised concerns that the proportion of clean electricity actually used by these suppliers is very limited, resulting in double-counting - claiming to allocate clean electricity to Apple, but actually allocating it to other brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xun, chief sustainability expert of Quantis, an environmental sustainability consulting company, also believes that the supply chain of electronic products involves multiple layers of suppliers, and it is relatively easy to require first-tier suppliers, but second- to fourth-tier suppliers Suppliers are difficult to control. Without disclosing the proportion of renewable energy, it is difficult to prove that suppliers at all levels use 100% clean electricity to produce Apple products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Southern Weekend reporters learned from Apple that Apple closely monitors, reviews and verifies the data submitted by suppliers every year, and hires a third party to conduct independent reviews of suppliers’ clean energy plan methods to track and verify suppliers’ clean energy contributions and provide assurance on reported data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to interview questions such as double counting, SCS Global Services (hereinafter referred to as SCS), a third-party company that provides carbon neutrality certification for Apple, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;We will not provide non-public information about our customers to the media. information&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot; also believes that according to data disclosed by Apple, 24% of the more than 250 suppliers that have committed to using renewable electricity to produce Apple products are unable to purchase through on-site renewable electricity or renewable energy. To achieve clean electricity substitution, you need to purchase renewable energy certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun, founder of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), said that the use and procurement of clean electricity in foundries is quite complicated. Many of them are not directly connected to renewable energy, but through the purchase of green power or green certificates. Achieve carbon emission reductions. In this case, how to distribute the limited green power among its different product lines becomes the key. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple responded to a Southern Weekend reporter saying that newly committed suppliers will need some time to obtain clean energy solutions, so some of the clean energy already committed in the Apple Watch supply chain has not yet been put into operation. In the interim, Apple has used its own renewable energy projects to close the gap, reducing the electricity footprint of manufacturing the Apple Watch to zero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/oPvV6ckNV7gVCA15OIB0hUt2r2x56wnMeiu6J5MY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/oPvV6ckNV7gVCA15OIB0hUt2r2x56wnMeiu6J5MY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253295&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 27, 2023, local time, Denmark, Apple CEO Tim Cook (right) and Apple&#39;s head of sustainability Lisa Jackson (middle), CEO of European Energy Company Erik Anderse, behind the solar panels that power Apple&#39;s data centers in Europe. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Concentrate resources on one product line&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Suppliers often serve multiple customers.

The reduction instead of increase made Ma Jun suspicious: &quot;Theoretically, by concentrating indicators and resources such as clean electricity on one product line, it is possible for niche products to achieve carbon neutrality faster.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Apple emphasized to Southern Weekend reporters that there is no pinching problem and that the power allocated to iPhone or other products is not used for Apple Watch. iPhone 15 Pro reduces emissions by 28% compared to the baseline, with most of the reduction coming from renewable energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Apple did not clearly respond to why the carbon footprint of iPhone 15 Pro is larger than that of iPhone 14 Pro. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from industry insiders that it takes time for renewable energy projects to be put into operation, which may be reflected in the ups and downs of the carbon footprint of individual links. Apple&#39;s &quot;2023 Environmental Progress Report&quot; shows that total emissions in fiscal year 2022 decreased by 2.6 million tons compared with the previous fiscal year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun believes that in order to avoid &quot;digital transport&quot; carbon neutrality, Apple needs to disclose more information for verification. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Details of the carbon offset project are to be announced&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot; mentioned that Apple&#39;s information disclosure on carbon offsets is not transparent enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Apple stated in the Apple Watch Ultra 2 carbon neutral product environmental report that the remaining 12kg after emission reductions were offset using high-quality carbon credits from the Restore Fund project. However, no details were given on the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple&#39;s &quot;2023 Environmental Progress Report&quot; released in April 2023 shows that the Restore Fund will be jointly launched by Apple, Conservation International and Goldman Sachs in 2021. The focus of the first phase is Cultivate sustainably managed forests and generate high-quality carbon emissions rights. Key projects include the restoration and protection of high-quality production forests and native ecosystems in Paraguay and Brazil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going to a distant place to buy the carbon sequestration of a forest, how to ensure that the forest will not be cut down, burned by wildfires or double counted?

Shi Han believes that Apple’s first carbon-neutral product report did not disclose the specific details of the carbon offset projects it used, such as project type, location, quantity and price. This makes it difficult for outsiders to assess the quality and effectiveness of its carbon offsets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters obtained six carbon neutrality certificates for Apple Watch straps and watches from SCS. The certificates show the carbon emissions, carbon offset quantity, and reference of each product.

At present, the Restore Fund carbon credit project corresponding to Apple Watch carbon-neutral products may not have ended yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the appendix page of Apple&#39;s &quot;2023 Environmental Progress Report&quot;, you can find information on two carbon offset projects used to offset Apple&#39;s 2022 corporate operational emissions footprint, namely Alto in the Peruvian Amazon. The Mayo Forest Conservation Project and the REDD+ project in the Kaiuru Mountains region in southeastern Kenya include a basic description of the project, year, repayment amount, and the project&#39;s registration link with Verra, a third-party carbon credit verification agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Restore Fund, you can currently check the location, planning, start time and other specific information of a completed project - Forestal Apepu on the Verra official website. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun said that Apple’s response to demands and disclosure of carbon neutrality certificates to the public is a step worthy of recognition. However, the current carbon neutral certificates still lack specific information on carbon credits. Now that carbon neutral products have been promoted and marketed, more detailed information on carbon offset projects should be disclosed to the public in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot; cited the PAS2060 carbon neutrality standard issued by the British Standards Institute (BSI). When companies submit applications for carbon neutrality verification to verification agencies, they should submit the amount, type, and issuance time of carbon offsets. , validity period, cancellation date, etc. Although the PAS2060 standard does not require companies to disclose the above information to the public, Ma Jun believes that there is currently a lot of controversy over carbon-neutral products internationally, and it is necessary to review and improve the current standards, improve data disclosure requirements, and build a publicly verifiable chain of evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Data Disclosure&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Granularity&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Dispute&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun believes that the best way to resolve disputes is The way is to fully disclose carbon data to society. However, &quot;Suspicion&quot; pointed out that Apple &quot;has regressed in its position on environmental information disclosure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2014, IPE has successively launched the &quot;Green Supply Chain CITI Index&quot; and &quot;Corporate Climate Action CATI Index&quot; to evaluate the environmental management performance of brands in China&#39;s supply chain. Apple has ranked among the best for many years in a row, becoming a CITI &quot;Outstanding Brand&quot; &quot;one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, the IPE carbon disclosure platform will be officially launched. Companies need to change the way they submit carbon data. IPE has repeatedly confirmed with Apple about changes in its disclosure policy, hoping that Apple will push suppliers to fill in the disclosure form, and Apple told IPE that “suppliers will not be required to disclose factory-level carbon data to the public.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this, IPE suspects that Apple has &quot;regressed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple has had several rounds of communication with IPE. &quot;Suspicion&quot; published Apple&#39;s email in response to IPE. Apple stated that &quot;there has been no regression in the requirement for suppliers to report carbon emissions to Apple&quot; and &quot;we continue to encourage suppliers. Publicly disclose its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, participate in IPE’s initiatives, and advocate for transparency.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from various sources that both IPE and Apple support the disclosure of carbon data by suppliers. The difference lies in the granularity of disclosure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IPE encourages companies to disclose factory-level data. &quot;Some supplier groups have many factories, and some are even distributed around the world. If we only publish data at the supplier group level, it cannot be mapped to specific factories, and we cannot clearly judge the emission reduction progress of actual OEM factories.&quot; Ma Jun explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple encourages suppliers to disclose carbon data at the company level rather than at the factory level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple responded to a Southern Weekend reporter saying that the most impactful action suppliers can take to combat climate change is to transition to renewable energy. Because this positive impact (of supplier access to renewable energy) spans regions and potentially many plant sites, it is best measured at the company level, with renewable projects additive and localized to the same grid where manufacturing operations occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;factory level&quot; data also involves disputes over whether it is a trade secret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Weijia, general manager of Guangzhou Jie Carbon Technology Co., Ltd., a comprehensive dual-carbon service provider, told Southern Weekend reporters that carbon data is associated with many core confidential data, and companies have the right to disclose and share such data. There are also trade-offs necessary, and gaps in some data are understandable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If only third-party organizations can obtain and verify corporate carbon-neutral product data, it will be difficult for other relevant parties to verify it. Ma Jun believes that in the process of promoting carbon-neutral products, Apple should not &quot;outsource&quot; its disclosure responsibilities to third-party organizations that do not have the right to disclose. Unless a third-party organization is authorized to disclose on its behalf, &quot;pollution and carbon emission data should not be Classified as commercial secrets, disclosure is the principle and non-disclosure should only be the exception. The starting point to curb climate greenwashing must be, and can only be, comprehensive and complete information disclosure. At a time when the concept of carbon neutrality is widely controversial, we hope Seeing publicly proven carbon neutral products emerge on the market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“What needs to be acknowledged is that the current basis and standards for accurate inventory of manufacturing carbon emission data are still not rigorous and complete enough. It is normal to be questioned, and doubts will also help promote the development and progress of the entire carbon industry. Guan Weijia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Should we first create a carbon-neutral product? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is also controversial whether to first create a carbon-neutral product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Han believes that choosing a product to achieve carbon neutrality throughout the life cycle is a key start for companies to gradually achieve carbon neutrality for all products. But he also pointed out that when consumers buy Apple Watch, they may not know which combinations are carbon neutral - because only when they choose a specific watch and strap combination can they meet the requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jun also holds a similar view. Through the carbon neutrality pilot demonstration of Apple Watch, Apple can run through the process and help achieve the goal of carbon neutrality for all products in 2030. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xun opposed it. He believes that there is nothing wrong with running through the internal process, but it is not appropriate to market the concept of &quot;product carbon neutrality&quot; at this stage. Carbon neutrality practices by companies are completely different from promoting carbon neutrality in products. The former is an action taken by companies out of social responsibility, while the latter is a market behavior directly facing consumers. “When carbon neutrality standards have not yet been perfected, companies Self-declared carbon neutrality has no practical significance and will face the risk of &#39;greenwashing&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun said that the carbon neutral label is controversial internationally, and some stakeholders have begun to formulate more stringent requirements. Under the condition that relevant standards need to be improved, companies that label their products with carbon-neutral labels have the responsibility to support green marketing through comprehensive information disclosure to avoid misleading consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple’s carbon neutral green logo is five eye-catching green leaves, but some companies have indicated that they will abandon the carbon neutral label. For example, in May 2023, Evian posted on its website that Evian was proud of the Carbon Trust certification it had obtained, but would not seek re-certification on a global scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, the Carbon Trust also announced that it would no longer provide carbon neutral label certification. The Carbon Trust is headquartered in the UK and has more than 20 years of consulting and certification experience. In 2007, it released the world&#39;s first carbon label based on product carbon footprint certification. Zhao Lijian, president of Carbon Trust China, told Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;carbon neutral labels are still in high demand around the world. The cancellation of carbon neutral labels is not because Evian or other companies will no longer continue to use them,&quot; but because &quot;the market is constantly changing.&quot; To support local development, more ambitious carbon labels need to be provided.” The updated label was well thought out and not a hasty cancellation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Lijian said that consumers hope that companies will take more active and transparent climate actions. The Carbon Trust’s updated carbon label no longer emphasizes carbon neutrality to avoid consumers mistakenly thinking that products have no carbon emissions or zero emissions. Instead, the focus is on carbon reduction and product carbon footprint comparisons. For example, the carbon reduction label will show how much the product&#39;s carbon footprint has been reduced through emission reduction measures compared with before; the low-carbon label will list: the carbon emissions of this product are lower than similar products of the same company; or the carbon emissions of this product are lower than similar products on the market Products are lower. Labels also display more comprehensive information via URL/QR code. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We should face the issue of carbon neutrality with more humility, recognize the complexity behind successfully achieving carbon neutrality, and face up to the difficulties.” Ma Jun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[钱伟长 最厉害的偏科生丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258236]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
