Visitors explain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A human science museum hidden in the Fenglin Campus of Fudan University has become popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Many people came here after reading Xiaohongshu and Dianping. Everyone is curious about how a place displaying human specimens has become a &#39;niche check-in place&#39; and an &#39;Internet celebrity museum&#39;.&quot; In order to Not to miss every consultation call, director Zhou Guomin specially bound the landline of the science museum to his mobile phone number. Therefore, Zhou Guomin&#39;s mobile phone almost never stopped ringing throughout the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What few visitors know is that being the curator of the Human Science Museum is just one of Zhou Guomin’s many jobs. He served as the head of the Department of Anatomy and Histoembryology at Fudan University School of Basic Medicine for nearly two decades. , at the beginning of the fall semester of 2023, he will also be responsible for teaching more than 20 class hours/week, and he also has many anatomy-related positions and titles outside the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This year is my tenth year at the Human Body Science Museum. I also want to do a better job in popularizing science and discover more stories so that ordinary people can feel the warmth of medicine.” Zhou Guomin said to the South reporters said over the weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is compiled based on the dictation of Professor Zhou Guomin:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;Tell children how new life is born&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;Although the Human Science Museum is small, it has a long history and a rich collection, such as tissue sections labeled with Yenching University, a micromanipulator produced in Germany in 1930, a complete skeleton and whole-body plastinated specimens. But the most conspicuous place upon entering is the baby specimen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1944, Professor Yan Fuqing’s daughter-in-law gave birth to a pair of twin baby girls, who died due to premature birth. For a long time, Chinese people have believed that &quot;the deceased is the most important&quot; and there are few body donors. However, Yan Fuqing selflessly donated the bodies of his relatives to medical research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/aruBfaepCDnnJMJ5gjgYQiBs6u5QTNFXISupbcvd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;952&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/aruBfaepCDnnJMJ5gjgYQiBs6u5QTNFXISupbcvd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254081&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 9, 2023, Zhou Guomin introduced the specimens of twin baby girls to visitors and the story behind the specimens. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Fuqing is the former National Shanghai Medical College (the predecessor of Fudan University Shanghai Medical College) and the Chinese Medical Association The founder of the company is known as the &quot;Father of Modern Chinese Medicine&quot;. For nearly eighty years, these baby girls have been studied and admired by generations of medical students, and are now placed where they can be seen at first sight when entering the museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Fuqing’s grandson Yan Zhiyuan is also studying and working in medicine. Similar to his sister, he is also a twin, but his brother unfortunately died at birth. In order to fulfill his grandfather&#39;s last wish, Yan Zhiyuan decided to donate his body to his alma mater for autopsy after his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some baby specimens in the Human Science Museum with brain malformations, which are very distressing to see. This was actually because some pregnant women at that time lacked necessary vitamins, resulting in poor fetal brain development. Later, after folic acid supplementation was advocated, the incidence of fetal brain malformations was greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the people who visit the Human Body Science Museum are parents who bring their children to learn about human body science. I like to tell children how new life is born, starting with the production of sperm and eggs. Every child is a champion, healthy, strong, hard-working, living in the dream palace provided by his mother, and comes into this world with love and hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many doctors are working hard for the birth of new life. If any of these interested children are willing to engage in medicine in the future, I will be even happier. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Both an &quot;alumni&quot; and a &quot;mentor&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Every time a visitor comes, I want to ask them where they come from and why they think of it. Gotta visit this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Shanghai’s museum resources are really rich, and the name of the Human Body Science Museum seems a bit scary at first glance, but they come all the way here and have to make an appointment to enter the school, which is more cumbersome; On the one hand, I am also looking for potential connections between visitors and this pavilion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the visitors, some are engaged in medical-related work themselves, some have relatives who are ill and are seeking treatment in nearby hospitals, and they come to visit and study while accompanying them, and some want to learn about body donation. A visitor surnamed Wu once added me on WeChat to learn how to donate a body to his seriously ill mother, which was her mother’s wish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone who studies medicine knows that without corpses, there would be no anatomy, and without anatomy, there would be no modern medicine. Without visible and tangible human specimens, it would be difficult for medical schools to train excellent doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So we are full of respect for body donors and call them body teachers. These general teachers are both our &quot;alumni&quot; and &quot;mentors&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, I have been collecting older body donation certificates. There are many application and volunteer forms from the 1980s and 1990s taped to one wall in the museum. The papers have turned yellow, but the handwriting is still beautiful and clear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest note that can be found is on September 23, 1981. An old man named Zhao Leshi expressed his willingness to contribute his body to the cause of medical science after his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/1UFIGjNIY2RPt6417kNBRkbOgxLLYYV6m1FDoNcT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/1UFIGjNIY2RPt6417kNBRkbOgxLLYYV6m1FDoNcT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254084&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The earliest body donation record that can be found was on September 23, 1981.

There were no telephones at that time. Now can I find the relatives of these early donors and express my gratitude to the doctors? If their family members knew that the name of Teacher Da Ti had been engraved on the monument in Fushou Garden in Shanghai, would they want to pay homage to the deceased and tell them about the pain of separation for thirty or forty years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have found one, and I hope to find more in the future and record the story of Teacher DaTi. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Science popularization should also be innovative and interesting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For many people, the body is like a blind box. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The onset of the COVID-19 epidemic has made everyone more concerned about their health and more willing to understand their bodies. For example, people know that infection with pneumonia may lead to &quot;white lungs.&quot; Look at the male anatomy teacher in the corner. His lungs are black and gray. This &quot;black lung&quot; is caused by smoking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fudan University has always had a tradition of attaching importance to science popularization. In 2013, the school allocated millions of yuan in special funds to carry out large-scale reconstruction and upgrade of the two original exhibition halls (referring to the Human Science Museum and the Pathological Specimen Museum, founded in the 1930s). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called collections and treasures of the museum are of course important, but I care more about everyone’s experience of coming to this exhibition hall. In addition to various microscopes, we also introduced VR, 3D printing, digital human systems and other equipment to enhance the sense of technology and interactive experience. Some children lingered and came several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to popularize science more interestingly, we have also engaged in several cross-border cooperations. Currently going on is &quot;Open Your Blind Box - Human Anatomy Art Exhibition&quot;, where the creators combine medicine and art. After the opening, the number of visitors who made reservations online increased significantly, and some people came specifically for this purpose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/n9Kvb9iJFI4HrfBABGoZDm5i6mOZaYDDAwc40BVW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;952&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/n9Kvb9iJFI4HrfBABGoZDm5i6mOZaYDDAwc40BVW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254083&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In April 2023, the &quot;Open Your Blind Box - Human Anatomy Art Exhibition&quot; at the Human Science Museum of Fudan University officially opened. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine painting each bone with colorful patterns such as giraffes and Garden of Eden. A blood vessel or nerve can have different colors. Each specimen is sketched with a black pen to form a volume of pictures. At this moment, the human body becomes no longer mysterious and becomes more exciting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that the same object and the observation perspectives of different disciplines and fields will bring different discoveries and experiences. Art is the constant experimentation and innovation of viewing angles. More importantly, art can give people the courage to observe from conventional angles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[旋转的白森林]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258574]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/CDGLWAR98C8pWtIuxfWnkE9P6QN98wHniNqZbJhv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/CDGLWAR98C8pWtIuxfWnkE9P6QN98wHniN qZbJhv. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253666&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Grassland Sky Road Observation Deck&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All things are one and connected to each other. The signs appear, but their meaning is difficult to decipher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I spent the whole morning roaming in the wilderness. On the rolling hills, oats and sunflowers sway in the wind, waiting to be harvested. Autumn has come to Zhangbei grassland again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under a cement pole, I took off my backpack and sat down to rest. It&#39;s quiet around here. Occasionally a car would pass by silently on the road in the distance. Listen carefully to the hum of wind turbines grinding the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number &quot;76&quot; is affixed to the pole. This number has special meaning to me - the birthday of a close relative. A few black feathers and a dried neck bone were scattered on the grass. Seven years ago today, I was driving her on the highway and killed a magpie. The night before, she slept in an orchard near the China-North Korea border and had a nightmare - an eye stared at her in the night sky. After waking up, she heard a woman crying all night on the mountain - an eagle owl was crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2R802a1KiPtLOBbZJKzTQcIEW7CBNMyaP8HyiAaN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;362&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2R802a1KiPtLOBbZJKzTQcIEW7CBNMyaP8HyiAaN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253667&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mature sunflowers&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the hill Opera and the sound of tractors came from the villages. I looked away from the feathers. The village square became a threshing floor, and shelled oats were spread on the cement floor like kraft paper. Oats like cold, tolerate drought, and are resistant to salt and alkali. They have been cultivated by Guansai border people since ancient times. They are easy to feel full after eating and difficult to digest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the afternoon, I passed a poplar forest and faintly smelled the scent of sheep. There are a group of sheep in the forest, heads gathering together, as if they are performing some kind of silent ceremony. I sneaked into the woods quietly, fearing to disturb them. Unexpectedly, the owner of the sheep suddenly appeared and startled me. A woman wearing pink sneakers holds a mobile phone and a whip in her hands, and a baseball cap on her head is embroidered with the Chanel logo. I asked her what the sheep were doing together, and she said they didn&#39;t like to move when they were full. I said: There are thirty of them, right? She said there were more than seventy of them, clustered in a pile so they couldn’t be counted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;White impeller, circular pointer. Rotating, without beginning or end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/jvmN7nZl3VkQS06XfxjZbn4bpxBAThbh1jGDRrSj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/jvmN7nZl3VkQS06XfxjZbn4bpxBAThbh1jGDRrSj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253668&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Oats waiting to be harvested&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wan On the winding country road, I met another shepherd. He was old and walked slowly. He was leaning on a dead branch in his left hand and holding a ewe in his right hand. The ewe has a stubborn character and keeps wrestling with the old man, trying to break free. The reins connecting them are stretched straight. The old man told me that he went to his daughter&#39;s house in a neighboring village to tend sheep early in the morning. The ewe was two years old and had given birth to two litters of two lambs. One lamb was sold for six hundred. The ewe seemed to be eavesdropping on our conversation, nibbling on the sunflower trays on the roadside and looking at us sideways with her yellow eyes. The old man tightened the reins again and made another circle in his hand. He wore several layers of clothes, and his red baseball cap was embroidered with the logo - ×× Fertilizer. &quot;It will take an hour until we get home,&quot; he put the tip of his tongue against his sunken lips, with a hint of complaint in his tone, &quot;I forgot to put on my dentures when I went out, and my daughter stayed to eat...&quot; I glanced at his dark mouth, with only the lower gums remaining. A loose crooked tooth is like a stone monument in the dark night. I think of another &quot;mouth&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/i3VIfLsnnkMqtKL9vctv3GvstFEtBAhv7dzQi5pi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;359&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/i3VIfLsnnkMqtKL9vctv3GvstFEtBAhv7dzQi5pi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253676&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the poplar forest, well-fed sheep&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The autumn wilderness is colorful and full of temptation. Not long after driving out of Zhangbei County, I couldn&#39;t wait to leave the main road and drove toward the distant hills, dragging the yellow dust cloud behind the car. Went around several old elm trees covered with moss, turned two turns, and finally reached a plateau. A van was parked next to a wheat field, with black film on the windows and half-open side windshield of the cab, without a driver. The view here is wide and unobstructed: countless white windmills are spinning lazily; harvesters are raising puffs of dust and smoke in the wheat fields; a box of &quot;Gatling&quot; fireworks tubes are lying quietly on the grass after being discharged. Accompanying them are drink bottles, cigarette boxes, grocery bags and tissues with lip gloss stuck on them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The van started suddenly, turned around suddenly, and drove towards the road at an unusual speed. After the van drove away, I noticed that there was a commanding point on the high ground - a hill covered with grass. The hills are surrounded by wheat fields. I stepped over the wheat stubble and patrolled around the mountains. The locusts in the fields were flying like shrapnel. This is an &quot;artificial mountain&quot; about 4 meters high and nearly 8 meters in diameter. The moment I climbed to the top of the mountain, I was glad I stopped in time. There is a hole the size of a wellhead in the middle of the top of the mountain. The entrance of the cave is circular, and the cave wall gradually becomes a trapezoid as it goes down. When it is close to the ground, the tunnel turns into a side cave. The hole was dug cleanly, with no residual soil around it. The entrance of the cave is like an open mouth, shouting silently towards the sky. I turned up my collar and carefully walked down the hill. A civet cat scurried past me with a black bird in its mouth. I was stunned for a moment, then quickly got into the car and drove towards the highway at the speed of a van. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/osadEbuMuW9R6LvoBjVXPvXnJtI0VJm4orM1Oa9j.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;359&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/osadEbuMuW9R6LvoBjVXPvXnJtI0VJm4orM1Oa9j.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253669&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Villers drying oats&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two Soldiers were running cross-country on the road. The short one was leading and the tall one was lagging behind. They gasped and turned to look at me. The confusion on their faces flashed across their faces. A pair of middle-aged men and women with oily hair and powdery faces seemed to have improvised. They were carrying shopping bags. They lower their heads in the forest, pick mushrooms, and shoot videos; groups of well-fed Dauri jackdaws sit on the roadside wires, chattering and quarreling. They like to forage among the domestic animals in the pasture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/0DzRNolGF5qAJV0y12AMhteoCXhL88VJq6UwHivu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/0DzRNolGF5qAJV0y12AMhteoCXhL88VJq6UwHivu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253671&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hills on the highlands&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Past Two villages later, I turned onto another dirt road to see what lay behind the hills. I parked my car halfway up the mountain and walked to the top of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some cold-resistant vegetation is still taking advantage of the short time in autumn to quietly grow: cold mugwort clinging to the ground; reborn dandelions; potted white daisy; and royal blue delphiniums whose petals are like birds spreading their wings... …&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Nf1UGFVm7curjSE9vwLBXuHuigfVpjDMIWUBrxOw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height =&quot;359&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Nf1UGFVm7curjSE9vwLBXuHuigfVpjDMIWUBrxOw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253675&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Black feathers under the pole&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Sharp syncopation pierced the airflow - a peregrine falcon performed aerobatics in the air, sometimes hovering, sometimes fluttering high, sometimes spiraling into a dive... It seemed to be performing specifically for me. The peregrine falcon is the fastest hunting bird in the world, with speeds exceeding 300 kilometers per hour. I stood there, holding the telescope and not daring to move. Between the loss of focus and the pursuit of focus, I stared at this unpredictable gray-white elf with almost no blinking. I was completely shocked by its transcendent dance of wind, forgetting the existence of time. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/lAtDyNMvEhSKnt4nibWeIMLTMnzDui3oZ5PAkQTm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/lAtDyNMvEhSKnt4nibWeIMLTMnzDui3oZ5PAkQTm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253672&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Prop horse&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src= &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/waO37yI04NzNYmclZ8TR08gDoVuU77IUxUGQGAYr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/waO37yI04NzNYmclZ8TR08gDoVuU77IUxUGQGAYr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253670&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot; >;Circular ruts created by drift&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are mountains beyond the mountains. After climbing two hills in a row, I saw the scenery behind the mountains - a basin as big as a playground that was very different from the surroundings. The flat ground was covered with a layer of black stone chips that looked like volcanic ash, and there was no grass growing on it. A strange circular rut appears in the center of the basin. On a collapsed cliff, a wall made of masonry and reinforced concrete was exposed. I looked around and saw no other buildings except the towering windmill. I guess the purpose of this place is: mining factory, school, pasture, experimental base...it seems none of them. Another possibility suddenly occurred to me - fortifications. In the 1960s, Sino-Soviet relations broke down. In order to prevent a large-scale invasion by the Soviet Union, our country built a large number of defense fortifications along the borders of North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Fortunately, a large-scale war did not break out, and the useless fortifications gradually turned into historical relics that no one cared about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I regret not bringing a tent with me on this trip. This is an ideal camping spot. Open, hidden, leeward, silent, the surrounding scene is shrouded in a mysterious science fiction color. Funnel spiders swung back and forth between the rocks, searching for joints; ant ants dragged the dying wasps forward; white butterflies stood on the porous basalt and fluttered their wings. Every life is the crystallization of billions of years. A blue pebble shaped like a snake egg jumped into sight. After examining it, I knocked it against a rock. Miraculously, the 3 mm-thick &quot;eggshell&quot; split into two and fell off completely.

The large green spaces behind the shops along the street are also enclosed into courtyards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are constant disputes between shop owners and villa neighbors over the ownership of this green space. Some villa owners claim that this green space is the &quot;backyard&quot; listed on the property certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2018, Lu Caiyun and other shop owners have repeatedly complained to Hefei City Letters and Calls Bureau, Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, High-tech Zone Management Committee, High-tech Zone Shulu Community Service Center and other departments. Until 2022, the Hefei Real Estate Registration Center admitted that the contents of the real estate certificates of villa owners were incorrect and needed to be updated. In May 2023, the mayor&#39;s mailbox replied that the Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau had identified the &quot;backyard&quot; as an illegal construction in accordance with the law. But so far, these &quot;backyards&quot; have not been demolished.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Businesses represented by Lu Caiyun wrote in the complaint letter: &quot;Repeated visits to the same problem have not only consumed a lot of government resources, but also affected the public health. We live a normal life. The relevant departments have also admitted their mistakes, and the facts are very clear. When will it be resolved?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Public green space has been included in the private property certificate&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;Xuhuihushanyuanzuo Community is located on Fushan Road, High-tech Zone, Hefei City. In 2016, Lu Caiyun purchased a street shop in the community and opened a Chinese restaurant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to her recollection, after the shop was delivered, she installed the outdoor air conditioner on the south wall near the villa in accordance with the property management requirements. At that time, no one was living in the villa behind the south wall. The area between the two was planted with green plants and there was a stone road for people to pass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, due to a malfunction of the air conditioner in the store, maintenance personnel needed to repair the outdoor unit of the air conditioner. At this time, the area between the shop and the villa has become the private garden of the villa area, and the south wall of the shop has become the &quot;wall&quot; of the garden. With the coordination of neighborhood committee staff, Lu Caiyun was able to enter her neighbor&#39;s &quot;garden&quot; to repair the air conditioner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Caiyun is not the only one who has disputes with the owners of villas because of the open space behind the shop. As early as 2018, some shop owners discovered that the vacant land had been turned into villa courtyards, and the east and west sides were blocked by walls, which seriously affected the use of the shops. They sued the developer Xuhui Group Co., Ltd., demanding that the 7-meter-wide space behind the shops be restored. Public land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The shop owners lost both cases. However, according to the second-instance judgment (2019) Anhui 01 Minzhong No. 4059, the evidence provided by the shop owners in the second-instance trial showed that the open space between the shops and the villa area was green space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Basic Terminology Standards for Urban Planning&quot; formulated by the Ministry of Construction (later changed to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development) states that green spaces refer to urban areas specifically used to improve ecology, protect the environment, and provide recreational areas for residents. and landscaping landscaping. The developer recognized this and stated that the actual construction was also constructed in accordance with the requirements of the green space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general layout plan of the Xuhui Lake Shanyuan Project approved by the Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau provided by Lu Caiyun can also support this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan map shows that there is a passage between the S5 commercial area where the shops are located and the villa area. There are clearly illustrations of multiple plants on the map, indicating that this is a green space in the residential area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 274 of the Civil Code stipulates that green spaces within building zones belong to the owners, except those that belong to urban public green spaces or that are expressly owned by individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Encyclopedia of Applications of the Chinese Civil Code (Property Rights Volume)&quot; compiled by the Leading Group for the Implementation of the Civil Code of the Supreme People&#39;s Court further explains: Roads and green spaces within building zones are usually owned by the owners. According to the legal theory of divided ownership of buildings, the roads and green spaces within the building zone belong to the common supporting facilities in the common property of the community. Under special circumstances, certain roads and green spaces within the building zone are not shared by the owners. As for the green space that is expressly owned by individuals, it mostly refers to the green space in front of the window of a first-floor building unit or the green space in a specific area adjacent to the building, and this part of the green space needs to be clearly sold together with the exclusive part of the building in the commercial housing sales contract. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the originally planned green space was divided into courtyards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since May 2018, 25 shop owners, including Lu Caiyun, have repeatedly reported to the Hefei High-tech Zone Shulu Community Service Center, the High-tech Zone Management Committee, the Hefei Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, and the Municipal Government. The Complaints Bureau, the Mayor&#39;s Mailbox and other departments reported that the owners of more than 20 villas in Buildings C55, C56 and C57 had occupied green space (8 households in one building) and set up private basements. Some of the problems were solved, but there has been no substantial progress in the encroachment of green space. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local media reported that the owner of the villa produced a property certificate, which stated that the land was indeed his backyard. Southern Weekend reporters were unable to contact the owner of the villa. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Multiple consultations failed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In August 2021, the then Party Secretary of Shulu Community Service Center in Hefei High-tech Zone was interviewed by local official media It said that Lu Caiyun submitted materials to the community on June 9, 2020, reflecting the problem of encroachment on public areas. After receiving the report, community staff went to the developer’s Shanghai headquarters to interview him and required the developer to respond within 3 months. Areas related to public access were set back, and the developer also signed a letter of commitment in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months later, because the developer failed to fulfill its concession promise, the community and urban management bureau planned to demolish the illegal building in the villa. However, the owner of the villa showed the property certificate on the spot, which contained the word &quot;backyard&quot;. area. Out of respect for legal and valid documents, the community temporarily suspended the demolition. At the same time, the Hefei Municipal Party Committee inspection team present was also aware of the situation and stated that it would investigate issues related to the real estate certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the problem could not be resolved, Lu Caiyun and others complained to the Anhui Provincial Letters and Calls Bureau in November 2021, requesting to find out why the green space was registered in the property certificates of more than 20 villa owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22 of that year, the Anhui Provincial Letters and Calls Bureau stated in a return visit that the Hefei Real Estate Registration Department had teamed up with relevant departments to investigate and verify the marking of the community’s personal property rights certificates, and was currently studying and handling opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 16, 2022, the Hefei Real Estate Registration Center also issued an announcement requiring the owner of the villa involved to correct the real estate certificate. The announcement stated that according to Article 81 of the &quot;Implementing Rules of the Interim Regulations on Real Estate Registration&quot;, because the owners of Buildings C55, C56 and C57 of Hushan Yuanzuo Community have incorrect content in the real estate certificates, they need to wait until they receive the notice. Change the registration and renew the real estate certificate within 30 working days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the fact that the green space is occupied has not changed. On May 9, 2023, Lu Caiyun once again reported the situation to the mayor of Hefei’s mailbox. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 23, the Hefei Real Estate Registration Center responded, saying that based on the previous request of city leaders during the interview, the High-tech Zone Management Committee organized an inspection of Buildings C55 and C56 of Xuhui Lake Shanyuan Building. An investigation into illegal construction was launched in the north yard of Building C and Building C57. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, in response to the illegal construction of fences that encroach on public green space and other issues, the Urban Management Bureau of the High-tech Zone has submitted investigation materials on the illegal construction of fences in some buildings to the Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau for identification of illegal construction. , Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau has determined it to be an illegal construction in accordance with the law, and the High-tech Zone Urban Management Bureau is handling it in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Caiyun said that they still don’t know the handling of the property certificates that were previously registered incorrectly, and there are no signs that the villa owner’s garden will be demolished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend contacted Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau and Hefei Real Estate Registration Center many times, but received no positive response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 26, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted Linxi Community of Shulu Community Service Center. The staff informed, “The community and self-regulatory bureau, the real estate registration center and the villa owners have negotiated many times to no avail, and it is difficult to Promote the demolition of illegal constructions.&quot; In addition, according to his understanding, the property certificate of the villa owner has been corrected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters checked the relevant regulations and found no clause that requires the consent of the illegal builders to demolish illegal buildings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 7, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the Urban Management Squadron of Shulu Center of Hefei High-tech Zone. The staff said that they were already going through law enforcement procedures against the courtyard walls built privately by the villa owners. “Previously, Use drones to take photos and collect evidence, and after the planning department approves it, the parties will be allowed to dismantle it by themselves within a time limit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 13:25:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以冲突又起，中东“和解大潮”难再续？丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258634]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 11:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the early morning of October 7, 2023, local time, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) launched an attack on Israel in recent years. The Israeli Defense Forces launched the largest rocket attack in the country, sent a large number of militants into southern Israel, and broke out in street battles with Israeli security forces. The Israel Defense Forces quickly launched a counterattack and launched a &quot;comprehensive siege&quot; of Gaza. The situation between Palestine and Israel suddenly escalated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has aroused widespread attention and concern from the international community due to its sudden outbreak and the huge casualties it caused. It is in sharp contrast to the &quot;reconciliation trend&quot; in the Middle East this year. It reveals the complexity and variability of the Middle East issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The intensity of the conflict is limited&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with the past, this round of conflicts has more obvious high-intensity characteristics, as well as the amplification effect of war news in the Internet era, causing It has raised people&#39;s concerns about whether the sixth Middle East war will break out, but at present, it is highly likely that the scope of this round of conflict will be limited to Hamas and Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, Egypt, Jordan and other Arab countries surrounding Palestine do not have sufficient motivation or reason to go to war with Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2022, Egypt’s economy has continued to slump due to the spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Exporting natural gas to Europe through the Arab Gas Pipeline and Israel’s Leviathan Gas Field has become an important channel for earning foreign exchange income. At this time, if Egypt is at odds with Israel, its economic development will undoubtedly fall into huge difficulties; Syria, in the north of Pakistan, is in jail, and its limited resources will also be prioritized for domestic economic reconstruction; Lebanon is experiencing a severe economic and financial crisis, and there is no are willing to participate in the war; the Gulf Arab countries with strong economic and military strength should only provide moral support and humanitarian assistance to Palestine as long as their core interests are not affected; Fatah, which represents the legitimate Palestinian regime, chooses I watched from the sidelines. Therefore, without the actual participation of other sovereign states, this round of conflict will eventually return to become a stage in the spiral evolution of Palestinian-Israeli relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;无限恶性循环&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;以色列与巴勒斯坦冲突不断，准确来讲是与以哈马斯为主的激进派别之间的对抗，实则是双方关系长期恶化的必然结果，和越过临界点的爆发式体现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年来，围绕着巴勒斯坦追求建国、犹太人定居点“合法化”、对圣地的争夺等问题，巴勒斯坦与以色列剑拔弩张的局面始终未能有所改变，甚至有愈演愈烈之势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年1月以来，巴以双方在耶路撒冷的冲突不断加剧，以色列军警多次在阿克萨清真寺附近强行驱逐巴勒斯坦居民；7月上旬，以色列军方对约旦河西岸的杰宁地区发起大规模军事行动，造成巴方大量人员伤亡和流离失所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;坚定主张武装斗争的哈马斯和杰哈德等激进派别不断推动其政治和军事势力蔓延扩张，导致巴以相处模式逐渐深入相互“以暴制暴”的无限恶性循环，并为未来可能发生的更大规模的冲突和危机埋下了隐患。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在双方力量极其悬殊的背景条件下，巴勒斯坦人民的生存空间被不断压缩，加沙地带长期处于以色列军方的严密封锁和监控之下，人口密度已达约万人每平方公里。据联合国贸发会议（UNCTAD）统计报告显示，2022年间，加沙地带有57%的家庭都出现了收入明显减少的情况，当地失业率则上升了49%，65%的人口处于贫困状态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经济持续低迷，令加沙地带的基础设施建设几乎处于停滞状态，联合国前秘书长潘基文访问加沙时就曾表示，以色列封锁加沙的政策“令人无法接受”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着阿拉伯国家与以色列的关系日趋缓和，尤其是最近沙特与以色列交往不断，甚至有达成和平协议的可能，使得巴勒斯坦人的不安全感被无限放大。在巴勒斯坦问题被边缘化趋势愈发明显的状态下，巴勒斯坦人唯有依靠自己的力量“置之死地而后生”。与此同时，合法代表巴勒斯坦主权的巴民族权力机构持续性无所作为，实则给哈马斯在巴勒斯坦内部创造了更多民意支持，使其成为巴勒斯坦民族意识的“坚定维护者”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此看来，此轮巴以冲突亦是长期矛盾得不到解决与地区内外博弈态势改变发生碰撞的产物。实际上，巴以冲突自存在以来，一直呈现周期性跌宕起伏的状态，这使得产出一项持久公平的解决方案，已成为一件几乎不可能完成之事。争取民族自决、恢复合法权益的呼声，在一代又一代的巴勒斯坦人之间流传，而随着以色列“最右政府”上台，以色列与巴勒斯坦激进派别的相处方式也必将充满暴力和仇恨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;高度复杂性&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;短期来看，本轮巴以冲突仍会对东地中海地区的和平稳定造成较大冲击，同时推动中东各方势力之间的博弈关系发生一系列变化。值得注意的是，该地区多种矛盾冲突和各国之间错综复杂的利益关系，决定了本次事件对中东乃至世界的影响，并不会以简单的线性上升或下降的方式呈现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，阿拉伯-伊斯兰世界与以色列的和解进程，短期内会进入暂停甚至倒退状态。当地时间10月10日，沙特王储穆罕默德•本•萨勒曼在接听巴勒斯坦总统阿巴斯的电话时表示，沙特将继续支持巴勒斯坦人实现其合法权利，意味着此前备受关注的沙以和解进程已“暂时终止”；随着伊朗宣布支持哈马斯在以色列发起的行动，其与以色列的关系也将跌至“冰点之下”，土耳其虽将在以色列和巴勒斯坦势力之间积极扮演斡旋者角色，但其与以色列的关系已几无可能回归当初。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，阿拉伯世界内部的和解进程将会被加速，巴勒斯坦事务或将会成为遏制阿拉伯世界“碎片化”的黏合剂。过去几个月，随着卡塔尔断交危机彻底化解，叙利亚重返阿盟大家庭，“阿拉伯之春”后，阿拉伯世界内部持续十余年的分裂和内斗可见一丝终结的曙光。在这一形势下，阿拉伯世界对巴勒斯坦的政治同情，将进一步推动命运多舛的阿拉伯诸国团结自强，并赋予其实现真正战略自主的精神动力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三，中东地区的主要矛盾或将发生变化。在过去的几十年中，阿拉伯伊斯兰国家与以色列的矛盾、逊尼派和什叶派势力之间的矛盾、地区国家与外部干涉势力的矛盾交织叠加，进而塑造出当下中东地区的地缘格局——其中任何一组矛盾的结构占比发生改变，都将改写相关势力的地缘诉求。在沙伊和解与美国在中东地区持续战略收缩的双重背景下，本轮巴以冲突无疑会促使阿拉伯伊斯兰国家与以色列的矛盾进一步凸显，进而产生一系列连锁反应。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回归冲突本身，无论是哈马斯武装对以色列目标展开突袭，还是以色列复仇式的猛烈反击，都已给双方造成了巨大的人员伤亡和经济财产损失——大量以色列人质被哈马斯劫持，牵动着以国居民的紧张神经。与此同时，加沙地带唯一的发电厂在以军的轰炸和围困下停止运作，也意味着绝望情绪将蔓延至该地区的每一条大街小巷。然而，仇恨和暴力从来都无法从根本上解决问题，巴以双方难以在涉及自身核心利益的议题上相互让步，巴以问题未来恐难上加难。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;此事并不复杂，事实也清楚明确。10月10日凌晨，当事女子到新加坡中央医院（SGH）急诊室求医，表示自己被代驾开车撞伤，要求迅速得到治疗。医护人员发现她没有戴口罩，于是把口罩递给她，并提醒她在医院必须戴口罩。当事女子不但拒不配合，反而爆粗口辱骂护士，抱怨自己“等了三个小时”。院方无奈之下只能报警，警方派出警察与调查员到医院调查。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从当事女子自行发布的视频来看，她不仅拒绝配合录口供、让调查官“自己猜”，多次转移话题，指控护士歧视自己，其间还对调查员爆粗口，并试图拽一名调查员的证件，被后者坚决阻止。根据新加坡警方的公告，当事女子甚至还有前科，她10月3日就曾在醉酒状态下，推搡拉扯送她回家的保安员，还用了侮辱性谩骂性语言。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月13日控方在庭上指出，若被告有意认罪，他们将针对其中四项控状进行审理，其余两项控状则由法官下判时纳入考量。被告对此直接说，“我认罪，我道歉。”法官询问被告会否聘请律师时，被告反问若不请律师，提早认罪是否能获得较轻的刑罚。法官解释，提早认罪有利于减轻罪行。被告表示明白，法官将案件展至10月25日，也批准她以1.5万新加坡元保释。除了保释金，还要有新加坡公民担保她，看新闻应该是没有人出面担保，她还是被带回警局了&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此案看似小事一桩，结果却是越闹越大，不仅法律后果极其严重，舆论效应也堪称“拉满”。细审本案从事发、事中到事后的时间线，当事女子的言行是一堂活生生的法治课，值得辨析与阐发。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，当事女子在事发与事中时的言行，恐怕都已经预先“写好了剧本”，但却撞上了铁板。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当事女子拒不服从医院规章不戴口罩，不耐烦等待就医，这都是事实；对着护士爆粗口大呼小叫，则是她意在发泄的同时进行情绪勒索；面对调查员时抵赖并一口咬定“护士歧视她”，也是希望“抢先画像”占据舆论主动；录下视频并在社媒发布，同样是为发动舆论攻势影响司法，逃脱惩罚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，调查员严格依法办事，表示此行只为调查“当事女子有没有对护士爆粗口”这一件事，同时三次警告当事女子不要录视频。面对调查员的公事公办，当事女子不但顾左右而言他，而且态度极其蛮横，语无伦次再度爆粗口的同时，还讲出了“请全新加坡的警察都来这里”的爆笑言论。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本案在国内舆论场引发不少共鸣。“扭曲事实”“抢先画像”“录视频上网”，这三板斧堪称国内类似舆情事件的常见桥段，当事者也屡试不爽。诸如“石家庄女子背后偷袭地铁保安”“重庆女子扇保安耳光”“女子牵狗进电梯发视频污蔑保安”的新闻层出不穷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，当事女子在新加坡来这一套时遇到了麻烦：护士没有让步，调查员也没有和稀泥，事后警方的控告也依法依规进行。事后当事女子当庭认罪，显示她所指控的“护士歧视她不是新加坡人不能看病”当属污蔑，不顾三次警告录视频的行为也未能争取舆论主动，反而给自己惹来了麻烦。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从当事女子“不再自辩，只求减刑”的态度看，她已意识到“剧本”不灵，只能杀跌止损。事发时企图以情绪勒索寻求特权，事中则录视频抵赖意欲逃脱惩罚，事后面对公正执法终于认罪服软。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，此案也再次显示，法律作为“明规则”的重要性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新加坡卫生部长王乙康在社媒发文感谢了警察的公正执法，重申新加坡对于此类行为的零容忍态度，“这正是我们要保护医护人员免遭的行为”。根据新加坡中央医院的急诊规定，前来就诊的患者根据轻重缓急分为四种类型。当事女子的轻伤本来就只是非紧急的“P3”级。医护人员优先将医疗资源用于“P1”与“P2”级病人，当事女子如果对此不满，大可去找私立医院花钱购买医疗服务，而不是大呼小叫寻求特权，或是编个“歧视”的理由抵赖。同时，当事女子将交通事故的情绪转嫁到与之无关的护士与调查员身上，更是不问是非的巨婴行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事件中各方的表现，也再次证明了法律作为“明规则”的重大意义。根据新加坡《防止骚扰法案》（POHA）第6节，“对公职人员使用侮辱性言语”属于刑事犯罪；当事女子不戴口罩，对护士出言不逊，未经允许拍摄视频，本身都已触犯法律，而不仅仅是某些营销号轻描淡写的“就骂了几句”而已。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对当事女子的言语攻击与拍摄行为，警方调查员骂不还口、高度克制，没有超越职权动粗，也没有因为当事女子的夸张言行就“和稀泥”，而是依循正常流程发起控告；如果当事女子对调查员与警察的问讯也不满意，事后她也可以对此投诉，而不是做出视频中明显触法的言行。而从新加坡中央医院的《行为守则》来看，当事女子如果真的遇到歧视，也完全可以经由正常的渠道进行投诉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你等了三个小时就代表你可以对护士爆粗口吗？” 视频中调查员的这句话让不少医护人员“解气”，就在于调查员强调了一个本应是共识的常识：当事女子应照章办事、依法行事，而不应该企图以情绪勒索、操纵舆论等盘外招，绕开明规则为自己寻求特权，或是绑架司法让自己免受惩罚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法律作为明规则的意义，就在于“如果一个人只需要遵守法律，那么他就是自由的”。当事女子的这次“文化输出”惨败而归也再次说明，唯有坚持法治原则、不和稀泥，才能让这种“舆论化妆师”（spin doctor）行为不再得逞，在类似公共事件中保障其他当事人的利益，维护社会公正。&lt;/p>;

title=&quot;室同道合？一份包含MBTI的大学宿舍分配问卷背后&quot;>;室同道合？一份包含MBTI的大学宿舍分配问卷背后&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“北理工宿舍分配统计MBTI”话题登上热搜后，越来越多高校拒绝随机分配宿舍的尝试被人们关注到。但每个学校用于分配宿舍的标准不尽相同，可能是作息习惯，或者是专业、生源地，又或者是时下最为流行的MBTI（迈尔斯-布里格斯类型指标）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;整个采访过程中，始终萦绕在我心头的问题是，用某些具体的指标分配宿舍，会比随机分配宿舍更好吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，很早之前，当部门需要招实习生时，我就曾尝试使用MBTI寻找最“完美”的实习生。我对“完美”的定义包括以下三个指标，有新闻热情、做事靠谱、百折不挠。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原本，根据MBTI所划分的16种人格类型的定义，我归纳出几个理想类型，但在后来连续几次的实习生招募过程中，我惊讶地发现，没有任何一个“理想类型”的同学给我们投递简历。之后和某杂志的编辑交流时，她在听我说完这几种“理想类型”后，很快找到合适的实习同学，我的一个猜测是，在投递简历时，对不同风格的报纸、杂志的偏爱，就是某种人格类型的显现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后，我的策略变为，在已有的实习同学中观察，他们中身上如果流露出前述的三种特质，那么再去了解他的人格类型，之后再招募实习同学时，就可以依葫芦画瓢。当然，由于样本量远远不够，这个探索在统计学上绝对是不具有显著性的，换言之，它一定无法推广到总体。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招募实习生，本身也是一个寻找适配同伴的过程，但在采访中我们发现，不同于我们对于“完美实习生”的定义，每个高校对于“完美舍友”的定义是不一样的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有的学校希望学生聊得来，有的学生希望表现优异的学生能“先富带后富”，这就导致分配方式五花八门。即便是同样会考虑MBTI人格类型的分配方式，如何考虑不同类型的搭配，不同学校考虑的要点也有些许不同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你的大学宿舍是随机分配的，那会不会进一步思考这样一个问题，为什么拥有一个完美舍友这件事儿，变得重要到需要各个学校捉摸各自的“算法”了？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个可能的答案是，语境正在发生变化。一部分意图让宿舍关系变好的人，他的大学生活是在1990年代或者2000年度过的，那时，舍友是人生最重要的伙伴。而当这些人纷纷成为大学老师之后，他们发现，今天的大学生会以另一种视角理解舍友关系。在稿子中一位受访对象就提到：“很多孩子进入大学以后有很明确的目标：保研、出国……从大一开始，他们就会遵从目标来安排自己的生活，不参与聚餐等集体活动，宿舍可能只是自己的歇脚地。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，这些“算法”是否真的有用？这个问题在四年，乃至更远的未来才能得到一个确定的答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果仅仅看招募的“完美实习生”，后来我仍然会询问每一位同学的人格类型，通常是在聊天的最后，并从来不会因此而拒绝让某一位同学前来实习。我也会告诉他我的人格类型，提前获悉这一信息，在日后的沟通中能减少很多摩擦。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MBTI尝试把复杂的个体用一些具体的描述简单化处理。在现实中，哪怕是同一个人格类型，面对困难都会有截然相反的应对措施。它只是人生某个阶段的切片，人的可爱之处在于时时刻刻的变化，某次困难，或者一次愉悦的经历，都会让人发生一点点改变。因此，“完美”也应该是一个过程，任何用单一指标寻找到的“完美”，都会在寻找到它的那一刻，不复存在。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;事情最早源于插画师雪鱼质疑Trik AI发布的图片与自己的原作非常相似。几天后，陆续有多位插画师发现自己的作品疑似被AI喂图洗稿。随着事件发酵，一些原创画师宣布停更，有用户将头像更换成统一的“抵制AI”图案，以示抗议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年以来，ChatGPT在国内掀起了一场AI大模型的狂欢，生成式AI热度空前，百度、阿里、字节等互联网大厂纷纷入局。小红书也在筹备独立的大模型团队，并在4月上线“Trik”。2023年5月底发布的《中国人工智能大模型地图研究报告》显示，参数在10亿规模以上的大模型，全国已发布79个。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生成式AI带来的狂欢仍在继续，但也有不少人担忧AI是否会代替人类的工作，而原创画师目前是受冲击最大的职业之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/o90KDT5Hk9wfM5y7p8knikhOeuXT3CPOHo19GSir.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;没有漂亮衣服穿，渴望拥有，她就画出来；偷偷买过期的杂志，临摹时尚杂志的人物速写，在这个过程中感受到快乐，她很小就知道美院的存在，那是一个“向往的地方”。在美术老师口中，她就是一个“为美院而生”的孩子，也大概知道自己长大以后一定会考进美院。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从毕业于天津美术学院，到成为一名插画师，一切都是按照理想中的步伐在走。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早在两年前，她就尝试过使用AI绘画。当时的技术有限，“非常小儿科，不太成熟”，但AI绘画诞生本身就已经超乎她的想象：冰冷的电子信息通过算法训练就可以完成一幅画。后来这些技术上的突破，更像是一种必然。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林梦并不排斥AI，科幻题材也一直是她创作的偏爱，就像她相信有外星人存在。“每个领域都需要科技化发展，就像小时候大家都在纸上画画，后来又在电子设备上画画一样。”从当下的时代，过渡到人工智能时代，怎么和谐相处是过渡期需要所有人去共同应对的事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;矛盾在于和谐相处是困难的，“因为它确实触犯到了我们的利益，其实也是尊严问题，别人偷了你的成果，你很难会大方地让它拿去。”林梦觉得，AI的不公平之处也在于，创作者要花一个月或者更长时间创作的作品，AI可以在几分钟内画出来差不多的效果，虽然细节不足，但已经能达到圈外人乍一看还不错的效果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一个没有情感的AI，之所以能够达到这个效果，是因为有大量的原创作品“投喂”，对原创作者来说，这是一件不公平又难解决的事情。没有规则，没有相关法律约束，虚拟与现实就会产生冲突。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年，林梦入驻小红书，以“榴莲煲排骨”的笔名陆续发布原创作品。事件发生之后，她宣布停更，去其他网站重新开始。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原创画师李可也和林梦一样，在知晓小红书和TriK的这一做法之后，决定停更，并把自己的头像更改为“拒绝AI”的图案。在聊到这一话题时，他仍然气愤，觉得这种做法是拼接、投喂、训练而非创造，“只是剽窃前人的辛苦努力拼接而成的尸块，所以我不会认可AI，更不会把AI当成工具，它本质上是剽窃。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;离开了平台，去别处似乎也只是一个暂时的容身之地，未经授权的作品用于AI训练的现象普遍存在。浪潮卷向所有角落，似乎是早晚的事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年11月，插画师洛柒也在微博质疑二次元AI绘画应用Niji·journey涉嫌抄袭，该应用生成的许多图片与一些画师的原创作品相似。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年3月，网易旗下LOFTERAI绘画功能也被质疑使用用户作品进行AI训练，导致不少原创画师逃到了其他平台。随后，LOFTER下架相关产品，并发布官方致歉信。而如今，其他平台也无法保证这群“流浪”的画师能够找到一个庇护所。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8月，B站也因涉嫌用AI绘画洗稿、侵犯网易游戏《一梦江湖》版权而登上热搜。当时，在B站主页更新的“七夕夜”活动宣传图被网友怀疑使用AI制作，还融合了另一位原创画师的作品，甚至留有细节bug：凹进去的手，只有一半的鞋子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不久前，风头正劲的OpenAI和微软收到了一份长达157页的集体诉讼书，被指控未经允许而使用数以亿计的互联网用户的个人信息。原告律师引述了OpenAI安全部门负责人的一段公开发言，该发言指出，它们的AI产品是“一项相当不成熟的技术”，如果没有足够的安全防范，激进地部署AI模型将是非常鲁莽的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就像画师们停更、逃离，或者在作品上标注“禁止AI”，或学习防止被AI训练的方法，都只是暂时，他们非常清楚，这将是一场漫长的挑战。AI浪潮滚滚向前，众生皆被裹挟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/lzioPAjx37uyIQOyBtFaU0Qe6BpzjiXEu7UQl4OC.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;她日常的工作流程是：在构图上借鉴AI，画好草图后，根据AI的一些图片进行配色，把AI当作一个素材库或导师，绘画步骤没有明显变化，但找素材的速度更快了。对她而言，耗费时间的步骤不是细化，而是前期出多种方案供甲方挑选，调整方案直到定稿，可以省下大量重复工作的时间，但因为她与AI还在磨合阶段，总体效率目前没有提高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从早期不认可AI，到接受和拥抱，最关键的原因在于，Zela发现它可以做到辅助作画，而且AI生成的作品有一半有可取之处，“我可以从中学习、吸纳。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在她看来，AI绘画目前还只是工具，但以后将是绘画的趋势，“因为太便宜太方便了，尤其最底层的人受影响最大。视觉中国、Artspace、Pixiv已经开通AI供稿渠道，AI图也已经在商用，主要集中在新媒体、活动海报等设计工作中，对动漫和游戏的影响还需观望。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;游戏行业从业者林源告诉《南方人物周刊》，游戏原画师包括场景原画、角色原画、美术宣发原画等，不少公司会将游戏原画设计需求外包给专门的公司去负责。外包是按照每张画的金额来付费，可以节省人力成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我所在的游戏项目，已经很明确地用AI做了一些角色设计。据我所知，还有其他几家类似的游戏公司也用了一部分AI绘画技术。最直观的影响就是，本来我们可能要发外包或内部人员去做的一个需求，直接用AI就可以解决了。”他提到，游戏领域的一些中小厂甚至大厂都有用到AI，只是运用程度和修改程度不同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林源举例，比如原来画100张原画，要招5名原画师做3个月或更长时间。现在可能只需要一名原画师，100张图用AI出图，他来做修改，这是一套已经广泛商用的模式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林源说目前AI的影响主要还在下沉市场，能够替代的是对质量和艺术造诣追求并不高的那部分市场，比如网页上的游戏广告，很多都是AI作画。一些对美术包装要求不高的游戏类型，也可以采用AI，但对一些要求较高的需求，需要花费时间设计打磨，目前AI是远远没有办法达到的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林梦的观察与此类似，大厂也有在用AI，但大部分只是辅助参考，并不是完全取代。因为目前的技术还无法取代，但它的确会取代一些快速出单的小公司，“这样的市场需求一直存在，只不过以前画师东拼西凑出来还需要一段时间。AI可以非常快，几分钟或几秒钟，所以才会威胁到这样的一部分公司。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI冲击的范围正在越来越广泛，不少游戏公司的美术设计岗位开始裁员，也有不少公司减少原画师岗位招聘。一位二线城市游戏公司的原画师回忆，前几年找工作还很吃香，现在公司大裁员，只留了3位原画师岗位，其余全部被裁。大厂也有危机感，某位大厂画师提到，公司专门调教AI已经花了快一年时间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“原画师去面试，工资很容易被压价，不会给太高。一些做原画外包需求的公司，明显感觉需求量变少了，之前一个月不愁单子，现在可能一个月只有这几单。因为有一些需求已经能够用AI来完成了，这是原画师的窘境。”林源所在的游戏项目美术负责人提到。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“AI会先从替换劳动力开始，就像在工厂里机器人替换工人，如今AI就是创作工厂的机器人。那些偏向于重复的、技术含量不是那么高的工作会被替换掉。原画师会越来越卷，整个行业越来越精英化，岗位肯定会少。除非整体的市场规模变大了。”林源认为，AI的出现还是为了满足市场需求，哪些可以被现有的AI技术替换，自然而然就会被替换掉。随着未来AI技术的提高，画师这份职业的危机感也会更强烈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使未被AI波及的画师也发现，AI出现之后，客户对时间的要求越来越高了。某种程度上，这是一个快节奏时代催生出来的需求，也倒推了整个生产链条的变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2A1UGazgFur6gR3HxRnNniCiwLt46JvYpk5KfjJj.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;上海大邦律师事务所高级合伙人、知识产权律师游云庭告诉《南方人物周刊》，主要难点在于举证，作者没有办法证明平台使用了自己的作品进行训练。根据我国著作权法规定，使用他人著作权作品训练人工智能的，应当取得著作权人的许可，但训练的过程不透明，所以作者比较难维权。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他还提到，人工智能生成的作品哪怕与原作者的比较相似，如果在特征性文件（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;指作品的特有元素&lt;/span>;）上不一致的——比如腾讯的logo是两只企鹅，企鹅的围巾或蝴蝶结就是特征文件，如果特征文件不一致的，仅仅是一只黑白相间的企鹅——不会被认为构成著作权侵权。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海曼昆律师事务所律师刘红林亦指出，根据现有法律和原则，如果平台未取得著作权或著作权授权的作品，擅自使用作者的原创作品进行AI训练、生成内容，存在侵犯著作权的风险。难点在于我国《著作权法》并不保护诸如风格或理念等抽象的“思想”，而仅保护绘画中的具体元素等“思想的表达”，但也恰恰是“思想”方能体现作者的独创能力。在此背景下，若作者发现AI绘画作品与其本人作品存在相似的画风，则维权的难度较大；只有在AI绘画作品存在明显抄袭的情形时，才可以向其主张侵权责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Wp2LUMoUI8J3ToOdjJt3JaWKtIA7Mqt3dEpNSnP3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;493&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Wp2LUMoUI8J3ToOdjJt3JaWKtIA7Mqt3dEpNSnP3.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;此外，平台用户协议也可能在用户并没有仔细阅读的情况下，同意平台用于AI训练。此次小红书事件引发画师抗议的原因之一也在于：根据小红书的用户协议，该平台有权直接使用用户作品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;游云庭认为，平台如果使用用户的作品训练人工智能，应该取得原作者的单独同意，而不是仅凭一个用户协议就可以取得授权。“这个用户协议哪怕签了平台，可能也会因为没有提供对价，而被认定为排除另一方主要权利的格式条款，也就是俗称的霸王条款。”刘红林也指出，一些对用户权益有重大影响的条款，平台有义务重点提示用户。对于存在明显的不平等、免除自身责任而加重对方责任的条款，用户有权主张合同无效。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“有效的修改，可以避免AI的痕迹太重，可以达到避免侵权以及避免质量太低的问题。”林源觉得，侵权的问题很难解决，如果只用自家图片或商用图投喂AI，学习的范围就比较窄一些。避免侵权，目前更多的做法是做二次修改。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过也有比较谨慎的公司。一位海外游戏公司场景美术从业者告诉《南方人物周刊》，这个问题主要看公司，不同公司对待工具的态度不一样，“我们公司禁止AI作图只是因为AI软件的素材来源我们没法控制，可能会遇到潜在的版权纠纷。与其卷入这类诉讼，不如事先就禁止。”&lt;/p>;

must be used with caution; it names a desire, not a profession.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Years ago, Louise Glick wrote in an autobiographical essay: The desire to make art produces an ongoing experience of longing, a restlessness that sometimes ends in a romantic or sexual way. There always seemed to be something ahead, the next poem or the next story, visible but out of reach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To fully understand it is to let it haunt and torment; a certain sound, a stone, becomes a torment - the poem that symbolizes this sound seems to be somewhere, completed, It is like a lighthouse, but the difference is that when you swim towards it, it retreats.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his nearly 60 years of poetry career, he has accumulated 13 poetry collections, which are stacked in the corner of the room. Occasionally, Glick would deliberately suppress some &quot;sneaky&quot; complacency and lament that he &quot;didn&#39;t waste time.&quot; Now, a new stamen has been added to her crown - the Nobel Prize for Literature. The award citation praised her &quot;unpretentious poetic voice that universalizes individual existence.&quot; Her first reaction after winning the award was: Oops, I won’t have any friends! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps in response to the suffering and shadow of the current global epidemic, jury chairman Anders Olsen quoted &quot;Snowdrops&quot; in his speech, which was the novel that won Glick the Pulitzer Prize. Award-winning poetry collection &quot;Wild Iris&quot; (1992). It depicts the miraculous return of life after winter and seems to symbolize the poet&#39;s &quot;radical transformation and rebirth,&quot; who, despite being constantly troubled by life&#39;s mistakes and changing circumstances, is still able to &quot;make leaps from a profound sense of loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She saw a vision of death at the age of seven, and was choked by anorexia as a teenager. The precocious girl shouldered the destiny of the poet to &quot;witness&quot;. With the help of myths and religious fables, she traveled between the holy and the underworld, transcending the &quot;confessional poets&quot;. As predicted in the poem, she is indeed more like Lazarus than Joan of Arc - the person in the Bible who was saved and resurrected by Jesus, whom the poet Sylvia Plath wanted to &quot;imitate&quot; but ended up The lost road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In her poems, the self listens to its remaining dreams and fantasies, and no one is stronger than her in the face of its own fantasies.&quot; Olson said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Hungry is not for experience, but for understanding​&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I was born cautious, in Taurus under the sign./I grew up and thrived on an island,/in the second half of the twentieth century;/the shadow of the Holocaust/barely touched me.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1943 Glück was born in Long Island, New York, to a Hungarian-Jewish family. These few words are the &quot;autobiography&quot; she wrote for herself. As the title of her second collection of poems suggests, this &quot;house on the swamp&quot; is not stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her father is a successful businessman with a long-cherished wish to be a writer, and he often tells her legends and historical anecdotes such as Joan of Arc. My mother graduated from Wesleyan Women&#39;s College, where many ladies were born, and served as the &quot;arbiter&quot; of the family&#39;s art education. She also had a sister who would become a banker in Manhattan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Glick&#39;s writing is not Cold War-style politicization, but personal politics. Her writing returns to the identification of human identity. This is a key point. All the women in her works are Looking for my own voice.&quot; Fan Jinghua, the translator who first introduced Glick to China, pointed out that the rise of personal writing in the American poetry tradition, including the rise of Western feminism, is the reason why Glick has won many important awards over the years. background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Glick, family seems like her &quot;concentration camp&quot;. &quot;I have a strong desire to speak, but this desire is often thwarted: my sentences, if interrupted, are completely altered—transformed rather than interpreted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short , &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;She does not meet the definition of a child: full of hope for everything.&quot;&lt;/span>; As an adult, she wrote in her poem Wrote, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;All the defense, spiritual stubbornness, persistence/taking off the mask of ordinary people and revealing the tragedy,/these are actually the The ignorance of the world./Means that which is partial, changeable, capricious -/everything that is excluded from the &#39;absolute&#39;.&quot; (&quot;Birthday&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the real The family trauma occurred 7 days before her birth, when her &quot;sister&quot; died unfortunately. &quot;Her death is not my experience, but her absence is; her death made me born.&quot; Glick later realized that she made such a dazzling declaration in her first collection of poems: &quot;Birth, not birth.&quot; Death is the unbearable loss.&quot; (&quot;Cottonmouth Snake Country&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tension between mother and daughter turns into a zero-sum game between the two sisters competing for maternal love in fantasy. In &quot;Ararat&quot;, the &quot;Book of Death&quot;, Glick wrote, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;When my sister dies,/my mother&#39;s heart changes Very cold, very hard, like a tiny iron pendant./ Later I felt that my sister’s body/ was a magnet. I could feel it sucking/ my mother’s heart into the earth,/ so that it would grow.” (“Loss” &quot;Love&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also rewrote the story of Solomon&#39;s verdict. When two mothers fight for one child, the mother is torn between the two daughters, and she is &quot;willing to destroy herself&quot; to prove who is the righteous child and cannot bear to split her mother apart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This mental symptom is related to the early realization of the &quot;destiny&quot; of writing. Not only out of the overwhelming will to get rid of her mother, but also the &quot;obsession with purity and control&quot;, when she was a teenager, Glick began to strictly implement a diet, from 85 pounds to 75 pounds, to some extent, she also imitated Zhen. De&#39;s asceticism eventually developed into anorexia, and he almost starved to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;It quietly begins/in some girls/the fear of death, in the form/of devotion to hunger, / Because a woman’s body is a tomb; it will accept / anything. I remember / lying in bed at night / touching soft, discrete breasts, / touching, at 15 / the disturbing flesh / that I would have sacrificed / until Limbs no longer / blossom and escape: I feel / what I feel now, align these words - / the same need for perfection, / death just a by-product.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The need for perfection Linked to forms of resistance, body and mind are both unified and separated, leading to a &quot;metaphysical hunger&quot;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Hunger is not for experience/ It is to understand as if it were available in the abstract.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seven years of psychoanalytic treatment saved Glick. After dropping out of high school, she interrupted her formal professional education and entered a poetry seminar at Columbia University, where she studied under two American poet laureates, Leonie Adams and Stanley Kunitz. Under the influence of the latter, she changed from being arrogant and arrogant to being humble and restrained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said frankly, &quot;Psychoanalysis taught me to think. It taught me to use my ideological tendencies to oppose the clearly expressed parts of my thoughts. It taught me to use doubt to check my own words and discover (self-expression It gave me the intellectual task of transforming paralysis—an extreme form of self-doubt—into insight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/30/5baeee3b828154edc453d9aa22355dc5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;984&quot; height=&quot; 656&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/30/5baeee3b828154edc453d9aa22355dc5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;117173&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;Some works by Louise Glick&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;When I feel safe , I can love&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Glick viewed this experience in a positive light, &quot;The feeling of hunger helped me control my greed, which was very helpful in gaining an independent self.&quot; And this seems to be It also established her own &quot;poetics of desire&quot;: in love, nothing is desired. She expresses her desire for someone or something in the world that she wants to possess by saying &quot;no&quot; instead of &quot;yes.&quot; What is undoubtedly revealed here is the finitude of human beings. Just like &quot;Ripe Peaches&quot;, from the door to the dining table, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Certainty, a dead thing/...accompanied by that obscene mouth/ Hungry for love -/it&#39;s like love&quot;&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps, because love is as scary as death, this has been planted since childhood: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Fear, of loss The fear of disease; / the fear of disease wearing the bride’s white dress” (&quot;Joan of Arc&quot;)&lt;/span>;; and the mother who “knitted red scarves of various colors” also said to her grown-up son: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;It&#39;s not surprising that you are like this, / afraid of blood, your women / are like brick walls after brick walls.&quot; (&quot;Poetry of Love&quot; )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the representative work of his mature period, the collection of poems &quot;Averno&quot;, Glick reinterpreted the story of Persephone in Greek mythology: she accidentally ate Pluto&#39;s pomegranate, Kidnapped as a wife and returning home &quot;stained with red juice&quot;, she realizes that &quot;she has been a prisoner since she was born a daughter&quot;; Pluto wants to say, &quot;I love you and nothing can hurt you&quot;, But he thought it was a lie, and what he finally said was, &quot;You are dead, nothing can hurt you.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Burning Heart&quot; and Dante&#39;s &quot;Divine Comedy: Inferno&quot; The protagonist Franziska&#39;s dialogue explains the power of the &quot;male gaze&quot;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Both fire and eternity/... even when I am touched Before, I already belonged to you;/You only need to look at me.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A more controversial poem is &quot;Mountain Plum Blossom&quot;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I hate them./I hate them as much as I hate sex,/that man&#39;s mouth/it blocks my mouth, that man&#39;s body/it makes people limp&quot;&lt;/span>; , the upper and lower positions of the body during sex, are as conventional as choosing which flower to &quot;light up the yard,&quot; but are essentially rooted in forced silence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Glick has always refused to be labeled as a &quot;hyphenated poet&quot;, and &quot;feminism&quot; is the most prominent prefix. Glick once emphasized that she and her sister were raised &quot;to reorganize, to achieve and to aspire to glorious achievements... We were never asked to believe that such achievements were impossible, either because of our gender Or our historical period.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is logically puzzled by the determination of some women today to write as women, since this appears to be an existing notion of ambition being constrained by gender differences. Rather than gendered distinctions, she cares about a &quot;bigger distinction&quot; between symmetry and asymmetry, harmony and homophony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we cannot forget that Glick calls herself an &quot;untrustworthy speaker&quot; in her poem. In her case, language is a medium that switches between frankness and disguise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother suffering from postpartum depression in &quot;First Born&quot;, the emotionally numb and silent daughter mourning her father in &quot;Ararat&quot;, the anger in the face of cheating and broken marriage in &quot;The Pasture&quot; The provocative wife... These images more or less reflect the loss and isolation that Glück constantly encountered in his life: he was divorced twice, and a house was burned down by fire. From then on, she became &quot;a dreamer and a viewer&quot;, an author &quot;obsessed with loss&quot;, &quot;waiting for 20 years to endure the inescapable loss&quot;. &lt;p>; /span>;This straightforward spoken language suddenly appears at the end of the entire collection of poems &quot;Rebirth&quot;, leaving a blank space with an aftertaste, which is also humorous and spicy. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I once told myself/From nothing/Nothing can be taken away./But can you still love anyone?/When I When I feel safe, I can love&quot;&lt;/span>; - this is the answer given by &quot;New Life&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Greek mythology, Dido committed suicide because of the loss of Aeneas; when they reunited in the underworld, he asked for her forgiveness, but she walked away without saying a word. In Glick&#39;s writing, she asked the goddess of fate to allow him to repay her passion, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; &quot;Even if the time is short. What is the difference between a short time and a lifetime: Indeed, in these moments./They are all the same, all eternity.&quot; (&quot;Queen of Carthage&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This poem was included in the book &quot;America&#39;s Favorite Poems&quot; 》Anthology. In his introductory work on Glück, scholar Daniel Morris noted with interest this anecdote: An administrative assistant in Kansas City, Missouri, described in detail how the poem spoke to her and helped her gradually come out of it. Intense intimacy with a scientist, moving on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Individualistic and universalistic, ordinary and oracular, ephemeral and mythical, tragic and comic...&quot; Daniel Morris pointed out that Glick&#39;s &quot;subject status&quot; in contemporary literature ” has enough room for malleability, it’s hard to think of another American poet since Bishop who has attracted such a wide range of critics, readers, and contemporaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glick&#39;s early &quot;Garden&quot; poems include &quot;fear of birth&quot;, &quot;fear of love&quot; and &quot;fear of burial&quot;, which are always Glück&#39;s The core theme, but the song &quot;Garden&quot; mixed in it still overflows with the true desire for love: &quot;But still/there is something you need,/your body so soft and alive, among the animals of stone./Admit it: being like them is scary,/more than hurts.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No wonder the poet Zhou Yan said: After Plath, how do women love? I recommend reading Glick. &quot;For a poet like her, if you are deceived by the surface coldness, aloofness, repulsion, and even the rudeness from time to time, you will be stupid. This kind of poet does not waste energy on the surface. What she focuses on is Human emotions, spirits and symbols. So it must be compassionate and warm inside. It is not the kind of poet who is cold or numb inside. This is the fundamental difference.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This voice is in &quot;The Triumph of Achilles&quot; 》 is even more firm: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;He is already a dead person, sacrifice/because of the part that can love, the part that can die.&quot;&lt;/span >;Translator Liu Xiangyang summarized Glück&#39;s expression as &quot;love is greater than death.&quot; Desire goes beyond the trappings of self-protective life and is connected to the recognition of virtue and glory. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let more voices fall off the paper&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It was from &quot;The Triumph of Achilles&quot; that Glick drew inspiration from mythological characters, those who were abandoned and abandoned. The voice of punishment and betrayal was re-contextualized in modern society and became her personal and universal &quot;mask&quot;. In the words of poetry critic Helen Vendler, &quot;give experience a permanent mythical form&quot; instead of turning your autobiographical experience itself into mythology like Plath, Lowell and other confessional poets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glick regarded the first collection of poems with the imprint of the &quot;Confessional School&quot; as a &quot;failure&quot;. Although the Nobel Prize committee complimented her by saying that &quot;in her own severity and unwillingness to accept simple principles of faith, she is more like Emily Dickinson than any other poet,&quot; Glick said that Dickinson was just her &quot; One of the Early Heroes,” which later became unreadable, like chalk on a blackboard or scratches of fingernails, or the voice of a crazy little lady—like a kitten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;American Narcissism,&quot; she pointedly pointed out the seductive misleading nature of Rilkean romanticism, &quot;In our poetry, narcissism reaches its most terrifying definition: It is not an extension of the self but a substitute for it, as if the lifeless mirror somehow allowed the surviving boy to survive.&quot; The end result: &quot;He reaches the end of his insight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;There is an automatic sentence pattern in Glick&#39;s mind, starting with &quot;Poets should not...&quot;, and the following blanks can be filled with anything. Originally, teaching also fell into this category. But she unexpectedly accepted a teaching position, taught poetry classes at Yale every fall, and served as a judge for the Yale Young Poets Prize. She was grateful for this and believed that it inspired her creative motivation. The rhythm and structure of one of the young poets gave her great inspiration. She also apologized to him specifically for this, fearing any suspicion of &quot;plagiarism&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is as strict with her students as she is with herself. The technique for preparing new poems is to completely forget the previous one. Each book is a resistance to the previous one. &quot;I have nothing to do with polishing milestones.&quot; Interest.&quot; Glick said in the interview, &quot;What I am thinking about is how to make the poems live longer. In these ever-expanding poems, he needs to reach different destinations from different starting points.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Typical Glick, with a language style that is &quot;alloy-like&quot;, always with coldness and restraint. However, different from the gloomy image on paper, she would imitate horse braying when reading poetry and also liked to laugh loudly. Humor itself has become a weapon for her style renewal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glick said she always tries to &quot;let more voices fall onto the page&quot; in order to shift gears at any time. She likes poems like this: you think you are reading one poem, but you are actually reading another, and then a third. &quot;Each sentence itself is not derived from the previous sentence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of musical The polyphony has already appeared in &quot;Meadow&quot;, and Mozart&#39;s opera has become the aria in the poem. Poet Nicholas Kristof commented on the collection of poems &quot;Averno&quot; and said that the 18 poems are rich and harmonious, &quot;with complex interrelated images, recurring characters, overlapping themes, forming a unified collection, but among them Every part counts as a whole.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And all her collections of works are not a unified collection? When the translator Liu Xiangyang contacted Glick in 2007 to discuss the publication of the Chinese version of &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, Glick was reluctant at first and hoped to publish it in full. In the United States, &quot;Poetry 1962-2012&quot;, which was published in 2012, was not titled &quot;Complete Works&quot;. It did not make any modifications except for proofreading, and there was no personal introduction. &quot;Poetry is the only thing she left to the world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the collection of poems &quot;Village Life&quot; ten years ago, the 66-year-old Glick seemed to declare some kind of impossible truce: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Body, thinking that we won&#39;t be together for much longer, I/begin to feel that I have a new kind of tenderness for you, which is very raw and unfamiliar, / Just like the love of my youth that I can remember.&quot; (&quot;Crossroads&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is still writing, and she is not writing slowly. The 2014 collection of poems, &quot;A Night of Faithfulness and Virtue,&quot; continues to approach the theme of death with extraordinary grace and lightness. The latest collection of poems is also expected to be published in the United States next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, &quot;hunger&quot; was always present. This is Sisyphean drudgery, &quot;The artist lies because he is haunted by arrival, he feels that the pinnacle is where he will dwell forever, a place where his burdens are transposed: Every moment of my life, I stand At the top of this mountain. My hands are empty. And that stone has increased the height of the mountain.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s very different now - there&#39;s no rush at all.&quot; Glick in recent years In the interview, she admitted that she could sit on the terrace and write trivia while thinking, &quot;This is the most beautiful thing in life, the sweetest thing.&quot; Just change the sentence and think, oh, this is okay. That sense of joy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It was a beautiful summer, everything was growing in the garden, and there were no obligations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Reference: Louise Glück, &quot;Alloy of Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Until the World Reflects the Deepest Needs of the Soul&quot; (translated by Liu Xiangyang and Fan Jinghua); Louise Glück, &quot;American Originality&quot; &quot;; Daniel Morris, &quot;The Poetry of Louise Glück: A Thematic Introduction&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王毅同美国国务卿布林肯通电话]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258628]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 21:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 14, 2023, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister, communicated with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at request Telephone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blinken introduced his current visit to the Middle East and the US position on the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yi said that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict continues to escalate and faces the risk of losing control.
