On November 11, a total of 639 million express parcels were received, which was 1.87 times the daily business volume and a year-on-year increase of 15.76%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bian Zuodong, deputy director of the Market Supervision Department of the State Post Bureau, said that this year’s peak season for express delivery business mainly presents two peaks, which are more stable, supporting consumption recovery, economic improvement, and user experience is more convenient. Big features. This year&#39;s express business peak season will continue to form two peaks on November 1 and November 11, sharing the pressure of the industry at a single peak and making the operation more stable. Postal express delivery is deeply integrated with e-commerce, modern agriculture, modern manufacturing, etc. During the &quot;Double 11&quot; period, the entire network&#39;s collection volume hit a record high, reflecting the vitality of my country&#39;s consumer market and a vivid portrayal of the economic recovery. Postal express delivery is deeply integrated into the e-commerce industry chain. A large number of pre-sale goods are pre-stored in the express cloud warehouse, making delivery services faster and more accurate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that this year’s express delivery business peak season will start on November 1 and end on the eve of the Spring Festival in 2024. In order to do a good job in ensuring service during peak seasons, the State Post Bureau has formulated a guarantee plan based on full situation analysis and service capability assessment with major e-commerce platforms and delivery companies, and comprehensively deployed and implemented it, coordinating e-commerce platforms and delivery companies to continue to play &quot; The core mechanism of &quot;staggered shipment and balanced promotion&quot;. At the same time, we will carry out in-depth investigation and rectification of potential safety hazards to ensure production safety, delivery safety, and information security in an all-round way, and prevent casualties in the industry; adhere to the standardization, recycling, reduction, and harmlessness of express packaging, and encourage e-commerce express shipments to be sent directly with original packaging , Reduce excessive front-end packaging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During peak business seasons and under low-temperature, rainy and snowy weather conditions, front-line couriers work for long hours, with heavy loads and high pressure. To this end, the postal management department continues to strengthen the care and care work of grassroots employees, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the courier group, and issues consumer tips, calling on users to give more tolerance and understanding to the courier group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[圣药丨本草物色]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260208]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/2fb4OeDpmkRFUzm2iHSIuYWuvkT2mgksjEEbRgMo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/2fb4OeDpmkRFUzm2iHSIuYWuvkT2mgksjEE bRgMo. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257540&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Boiled donkey hide gelatin. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Donkey-hide gelatin, known as the &quot;Three Treasures&quot; along with ginseng and deer antlers, has unquestionable unparalleled popularity. It is widely rumored that the famous doctor Ye Tianshi, who once used Wutong leaves as a medicine introduction, said that donkey-hide gelatin is a product of flesh and blood and is the most nourishing. The so-called products of flesh and blood, that is, animal medicine, were highly regarded by Ye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Donkey-hide gelatin is the glue produced in Adi, and the named region is a classic label for authentic medicinal materials. Tao Hongjing broke the topic: It came out of Dong&#39;e, so it was named donkey-hide gelatin. Li Shizhen refined and extended: Ajing is located sixty miles northeast of today&#39;s Yanggu County, Yanzhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, which is the ancient Dong&#39;a County. There are official residences that prohibit it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The talented scholar Cao Zhi moved to fiefdoms many times during his lifetime, and Dong&#39;a was his last stop before King Chen. After his death, he was buried in the local Yushan in accordance with his last wishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called official residence prohibits it, which reveals the qualification of donkey-hide gelatin as an official tribute tribute. There is a &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot; that can be endorsed: (Dong&#39;e) On the west side of the north gate of the big city, there is a big well on Gao Shang. It is as big as a wheel and six or seven feet deep. It is used to cook glue every year and pay tribute to the heaven. &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; calls donkey hide gelatin. Therefore, it has the name of Ajing in the secular world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Li Shizhen&#39;s description, the Ajing water used for cooking glue was injected with Jishui. Use it to boil glue, and use it to stir the turbid water to make it clear. Therefore, Geji water is clear and heavy, and its nature tends to be downward. The so-called heavyness lies in the richness of minerals it contains. It is said that each pound of Ajing water is about 3 pounds heavier than ordinary well water and river water. It seems that boiling glue is like making wine, and living water with natural texture plays a considerable role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; mentioned by Li Daoyuan is the &quot;Shen Nong&#39;s Materia Medica&quot;. The origin of &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; is recorded in it, which shows the antiquity of donkey-hide gelatin production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the raw material of boiled glue, &quot;Famous Doctors&quot; says that it is made from boiled cowhide. In other words, donkey-hide gelatin in this era was originally cowhide. Li Shizhen pointed out that those using cow, buffalo and donkey skins were the top ones, followed by those using pig, horse, mule and ostrich skins, and those using various old skins, shoes and other items were the bottom. Most of the ancient recipes used cowhide, but later generations used donkey skin. As for the reason for this change, Chen Zangqi explained that all kinds of glues are mainly responsible for wind, antidiarrheal, and tonifying deficiency, and donkey skin is the most important for wind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the replacement of cattle and donkeys should also be related to the fact that cattle are the main livestock power in farming and even military resources, so they are strictly controlled by the government. Qin law had strict laws that stipulated that those who killed cows and horses would die. Although later dynasties no longer required beheading, they still had to bear criminal responsibility. For example, Tang law stipulated that even if you kill your own cattle, you will be sentenced to one year in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The donkey, with its trimmed tail and drooping back, and its giant ears and two gongs, is regarded by the Central Plains people as a rare animal of the Xiongnu. According to Gu Yanwu&#39;s &quot;Rizhilu&quot;, since the Qin Dynasty and above, donkeys have not been seen in written records, even if they exist. Be an unusual animal. &quot;The donkey is an object. It was named after the Han Dynasty. It was filial to the martial arts and found its way into the forest. It was filial and spiritual and was honored. However, its species mostly came from outside the fortress.&quot; Probably during the Han Dynasty, donkeys &quot;entered the fortress with their tails attached.&quot; &quot;They are all our animals.&quot; From the appreciation of Shanglin&#39;s strange beasts, they can be used as livestock for transportation. They are resistant to extensive diseases and easy to drive. They are strong in disease resistance and have early maturity and longevity. They also win in the cost-effectiveness trade-off and win the favor of both the government and the private sector. The poet&#39;s descriptions of &quot;riding a donkey into the sword gate in the drizzle&quot; and &quot;the poetry of the sky and the sea are carried on the back of a donkey&quot; vaguely reveal the relationship between donkeys and literati. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the use of donkey skin as medicine, it should be after its mass breeding. In addition to the use of donkeys for servitude, eating meat and sleeping on their hides is an appropriate meaning in the title, and tanning and making rubber are also included in the title. As for the uses of glue, Tao Hongjing pointed out that there are three types of glue: clear and thin glue used by painters; clear and thick glue called potting glue and used for medicinal purposes; turbid and black glue not used for medicine, but can be used to glue things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called donkey skin is the most popular, which is the conclusion of the Tang Dynasty. As late as the Northern Song Dynasty, the donkey hide gelatin made from black donkey skin and boiled in well water was recognized as the best. In the view of strict medical practitioners, outside Dong&#39;a, there is only donkey gelatin but no donkey-hide gelatin. However, due to the exclusivity of tributes and the official ban on Ajing, ceiling-level real glue is extremely rare. Most of the goods sold among the people are forged horsehide, old leather, saddle boots, etc., which smell foul and cannot be used as medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although counterfeit medicines have been condemned, they have never disappeared. As a doctor with a benevolent heart, Li Shizhen is considerate and considerate. The yellow color is as transparent as amber, or the light and black color is as black as lacquer. The true one does not have stinky skin, and the summer moon is not wet and soft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prototype of Mr. Bai Qiye, played by Mr. Chen Baoguo in the drama &quot;The Mansion Gate&quot;, is Le Jingyu, the young master of Tongrentang. Mr. Lelao came to Jinan that year and founded Hongjitang. The donkey-hide gelatin he produced was known as the Nine Tips and Nine Roasts: peeling off the hair at the winter solstice, starting from the awakening of the stings, using copper pots and silver shovels, burning mulberry firewood, nine tips and nine moxibustions, and taking the ointment at nine days. There are ninety-nine processes, complicated but not many. The vernal equinox is exposed to the sun and the beginning of summer becomes glue. This is the path of Gongjiao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shizhen’s explanation is more concise: When making all kinds of glue, from October to February or March... all raw skins are taken, soaked in water for four or five days, washed and scraped extremely clean. Boil, stir it from time to time, and add water constantly. When it is rotten, filter the juice and boil it into glue, pour it into a pot and wait for it to solidify. The glue that is close to the pelvic floor is called jiaojiao, and the glue that is salty and bitter is better when fried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the time line of glue making, &quot;Qi Min Yao Shu&quot; also said that it takes February, March, September and October to cook glue, and the remaining months are not enough. The reason why it is not successful is that if it is hot, it will not coagulate, and it will not make cakes; if it is cold, it will freeze and become sticky, and the glue will not stick. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is the preparation complicated, but also the preparation of the medicine is quite difficult. Tao Hongjing said: Whatever is used, it must be burned with fire. Lei Jiao, known as Thunder God, said: For any use, first soak it in pig fat overnight, take it out, dry it with willow wood and grind it before use. Li Shizhen divided and conquered it: the current method is to stir-fry pearls, stir-fry with flour, stir-fry, stir-fry with clam powder, stir-fry with grass ash, turn into ointment with wine, or hydrate the ointment, each should be based on its own prescription. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most famous effect of donkey-hide gelatin is to harmonize blood, nourish yin, remove wind and moisturize dryness. As Li Shizhen said, donkey-hide gelatin basically only replenishes blood and fluids, so it can clear the lungs, nourish yin and cure various syndromes. In addition, he pointedly mentioned that dysentery is often caused by excessive heat, and donkey-hide gelatin is an important medicine for the large intestine. Those with heat and toxin retention can be relieved; those without heat and toxin retention can be safe. From this, he regarded donkey-hide gelatin as a holy medicine and made it a god. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This classic classifies donkey-hide gelatin as a top-grade medicine, that is, it is a royal medicine that &quot;maintains life and responds to the sky, is non-toxic, and does not hurt people if taken for a long time.&quot; Although not all top-quality products are the best, donkey-hide gelatin is indeed comparable to ginseng and licorice, and is worthy of its god-like existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公安机关公开通缉缅北果敢自治区电信网络诈骗犯罪集团重要头目明学昌、明国平、明菊兰、明珍珍]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260458]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 11:12:56&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Currently, the situation of telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar is severe, the social harm is serious, and the people have reacted strongly. Investigation by the Wenzhou City Public Security Bureau in Zhejiang Province revealed that Ming Xuechang, Ming Guoping, Ming Julan, and Ming Zhenzhen are important leaders of a criminal group involved in telecommunications network fraud in the Kokang Autonomous Region in northern Myanmar. The criminal group headed by Ming Xuechang has organized and opened fraud for a long time. The den is open to armed fraud and carries out telecommunications and network fraud criminal activities targeting Chinese citizens. The amount of fraud is huge. Under the severe and high-pressure situation of the public security organs, it still does not restrain or stop, and continues to organize and carry out illegal and criminal activities. At the same time, it is suspected of intentional homicide. , intentional injury, illegal detention and other serious violent crimes, the circumstances are extremely bad and the consequences are extremely serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has been found that the criminal facts of Ming Xuechang, Ming Guoping, Ming Julan and Ming Zhenzhen are clear and the evidence is conclusive. The Wenzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau of Zhejiang Province has decided to issue a public reward for their arrest. The public security organs urged the four criminal suspects Ming Xuechang, Ming Guoping, Ming Julan, and Ming Zhenzhen to recognize the situation clearly, step back from the brink, voluntarily surrender themselves, and strive for leniency. At the same time, we hope that all walks of life and the general public will actively report the crime and assist in the arrest of criminal suspects. For those who provide effective clues and assist in arrests, the public security organs will reward RMB 100,000 to RMB 500,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/UqJ0oPL9FmeNfZXTGzKDetP4S9YwiER5nzweN11E.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height= &quot;792&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/UqJ0oPL9FmeNfZXTGzKDetP4S9YwiER5nzweN11E.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258001&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/0UqEd83ptsiPSLyHQF2FwQgTl0WWin9CYMduHlQK.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;792&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/0UqEd83ptsiPSLyHQF2FwQgTl0WWin9CYMduHlQK.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258002&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/ctLXwsz1T06nEjNSwQzzRA7OzcOlWR1HqUU45BMM.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;792&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/12/ctLXwsz1T06nEjNSwQzzRA7OzcOlWR1HqUU45BMM.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258000&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/12/i056fcAa0u8aVFd1wraLjlR5IVKJxPD9uk9lUrN0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;792&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/i056fcAa0u8aVFd1wraLjlR5IVKJx PD9uk9lUrN0. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257999&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[温州市永嘉县桥头镇一民房坍塌，4人遇难]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260448]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 09:33:59&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to the &quot;Wenzhou Yongjia County People&#39;s Government Information Office&quot;, at noon on November 11, Yongjia County A house collapsed during renovation in Yantou Lane, Qiaotou Town, trapping four people.

With the development of the times, the original sacrificial singing and dancing gradually turned into a group singing fair activity. During March and April of the lunar calendar, or between August and September, when the weather is suitable in spring and autumn, people put down their farm work and sing in open places. Young men and women use singing to choose their spouses, and middle-aged and elderly people compete with each other and enjoy songs. Everyone and every family can enjoy the song fair, and the large-scale national event has shifted from &quot;entertaining gods&quot; to &quot;entertaining people&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/GDYjtAsOE2zGApnmHjnfaJ4JE5nRHMctRyY5jdT2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/GDYjtAsOE2zGApnmHjnfaJ4JE5nRHMctRyY5jdT2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257436&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stilt walking competition on April 28, 2014, Yiwei Town, Tiandong County, Guangxi &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song fairs are generally popular in Zhuang areas. In 1983, the People&#39;s Government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region made a decision to designate the third day of the third lunar month as the Zhuang Song Festival. However, in Tiandong, Tianyang and other places in Baise City, there were dozens or even hundreds of song fairs a year at their peak. In recent years, due to young people going out to work, the number of song fairs has gradually decreased. In some areas, after the old singers quit, there are no young and middle-aged singers to take over, and the song fairs can only be suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/0FCrEwFra4rmiU3HYTcLRlG1AzO0FG0iiSntiKPu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/0FCrEwFra4rmiU3HYTcLRlG1AzO0FG0iiSntiKPu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257445&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wrestling match on Little Tomatoes, April 4, 2017, Baiyu Town, Tianyang County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Picture)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to make the song fair continue better in the present? Tiandong County, Baise City, advocates &quot;one town, one section&quot; in 10 towns in the county. This time, the festival shifted from celebrating broad festivals to focusing on its own life. The song fair is not only for singing folk songs, but also for various folk entertainment activities, such as throwing hydrangeas, touching Easter eggs, grabbing fireworks, etc. Competitiveness is secondary, but more importantly, it is interesting and attracts participation. It allows towns and villages to discover their own special activities and stimulates people&#39;s enthusiasm for participation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/VthFdlQoy2VQMB9yYQIoHT6aU7PDl1PemJtLI3Hl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/VthFdlQoy2VQMB9yYQIoHT6aU7PDl1PemJtLI3Hl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bare-hand corn shucking competition on March 11, 2012, Naman Town, Tianyang County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yiwei Town is rich in fragrant pigs.

Zhang Longji, the principal of a primary school in Jingning County, Pingliang City, was shown raping and molesting many students in public. He was executed on November 7. On November 11, local government office staff confirmed to Nandu reporters that this notice was indeed issued by the Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court, which had previously heard the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/3b8ad1bc0bbb52159853539a5c14831e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;1135&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/3b8ad1bc0bbb52159853539a5c14831e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257973&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Court Notice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the announcement of Pingliang Intermediate Court, Zhang Longji, male, Han nationality, was born on February 24, 1979 in Jingning County, Gansu Province, with a university education. From 2010 to June 2019, when he served as the dean, principal and teacher of a primary school in Jingning County, he used corporal punishment and other means to form a mental coercion on primary school students who lacked sexual defense ability. He used opportunities such as explaining exercises and students to hand in homework to He repeatedly raped five young girls aged 8 to 12 in his dormitory, and molested 17 children aged 8 to 14 in public in the classroom or in his dormitory. The Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court found Zhang Longji guilty of rape and sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life; he was found guilty of child molestation and sentenced to ten years in prison. He was punished for several crimes and decided to execute him and be deprived of political rights for life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the verdict of the case was pronounced, Zhang Longji appealed, but the appeal was rejected by the Gansu Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court and the original death sentence was upheld, which was approved by the Supreme People&#39;s Court. On November 7 this year, Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court followed the execution order issued by the President of the Supreme People&#39;s Court, identified Zhang Longji, took him to the execution ground, and executed him by injection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned that Article 236 of the &quot;Criminal Law&quot; stipulates that anyone who rapes a girl under the age of fourteen shall be treated as rape and shall be severely punished. Anyone who rapes a woman or rapes a young girl with multiple persons, if the circumstances are abominable, or in public in a public place, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years, life imprisonment, or death. On May 25 this year, the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate jointly issued the &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in the Handling of Criminal Cases of Rape and Molestation of Minors&quot;, reaffirming the judicial philosophy of adhering to the word &quot;strict&quot; and severe punishment. The relevant severe and aggravated punishment clauses have been further clarified and refined to ensure that the punishment is suitable for the crime, the punishment is worthy of the crime, and the punishment is sufficient to control the crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一次误杀，引来一次次误杀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260434]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The new Korean film &quot;Plastic Greenhouse&quot;, in some The plot setting is very reminiscent of Bong Joon Ho&#39;s &quot;Parasite&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/8a8a72b85cc0cbc139587fdc901c0d35.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height= &quot;1282&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/8a8a72b85cc0cbc139587fdc901c0d35.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257924&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;played by Kim Seo-hyung The heroine Wen Jing is a low-level domestic worker who takes care of an elderly couple with limited mobility.

She thought that after destroying the evidence, she would be ushered in a new life, but what she didn&#39;t know was that her son was hiding inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title &quot;Plastic Greenhouse&quot; is very meaningful. On the surface, it points to the plastic greenhouse in the wasteland where Wen Jing ended up, but its deeper meaning is a mixture of Wen Jing&#39;s kindness and evil, her tragedy and the death she caused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/fc74edd0909394f1dafc9bf6d83a9c30.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/fc74edd0909394f1dafc9bf6d83a9c30.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257931&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first feature film The curtain is a plastic greenhouse in the dusk, like a huge coffin, making people unable to breathe.

Then, in &quot;Plastic Shed&quot;, &quot;burning the barn&quot; is replaced with another symbolic meaning: the person in the film is driven by the subconscious to take revenge on the entire society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why it is said to be subconscious is that, as mentioned above, we have never seen Wen Jing&#39;s humble anger, nor have we glimpsed Li Taijiang&#39;s superiority.

It constantly uses editing techniques to cover up part of the truth and hide the true emotions of several characters, making us think about what caused this series of tragedies. We can only watch as the gears of their fate begin to turn and slide step by step into the abyss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This can&#39;t help but remind people of the Korean film &quot;The Next So Hee&quot; that caused a lot of discussion in the first half of the year. In this movie, how did So Hee, who was lively and optimistic by nature, lead to suicide step by step? This becomes the question that detective Wu Youzhen keeps searching for in the second half of the film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the school where she graduated to the company where she worked, from her native family to the social environment, Wu Youzhen discovered that it was not a certain person who &quot;killed&quot; So Hee, but the entire Korean society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ca121b2f95e1fa4be552b9b0d8e0e08.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ca121b2f95e1fa4be552b9b0d8e0e08.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Plastic Greenhouse &quot;In &quot;Chun Nan&quot;, a mentally retarded girl was abandoned by her mother since she was a child.

Heading towards a tragic death; the heroine is quiet and simple, but she eventually becomes a murderer and destroys all traces of her body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These characters in the film obviously just long for a touch of warmth and freedom, but in the rigid system, their humanity is distorted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/c6b5027565afc4d9f42fce6a3aa9060f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;448&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/c6b5027565afc4d9f42fce6a3aa9060f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257935&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a new director Lee Sol Hee&#39;s debut film did not cause much response in South Korea.

Professor at John&#39;s University, but her family left China shortly after she was born due to changes in the current situation. She later joked that maybe she had been closely associated with the word &quot;revolution&quot; since she was born, so she has been interested in the Chinese revolution throughout her life. &quot;Without the revolution, I would probably have grown up in China. I have always been curious about the Chinese revolution, and wanted to know why the revolution happened and what consequences it would bring to China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili also spent his youth in China. She survived the surging global &quot;revolutionary&quot; wave of the left-wing movement, which further strengthened her future academic ambitions. After China&#39;s door opened, she became one of the first foreign scholars allowed to enter China for fieldwork and research. Her research interests mainly focus on modern popular resistance and grassroots politics, spanning the fields of political science and history. She has written Generous and award-winning, the American Historical Review commented that she &quot;combines a social scientist&#39;s love of order with a historian&#39;s eye for great stories.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili has taught at the University of Arizona, the University of Washington and the University of California, Berkeley. Since 1997, he has taught in the Department of Government of Harvard University. In addition to her teaching work, one of Pei Yili&#39;s greatest characteristics lies in her participation in public affairs. She once served as the director of the Fairbank Research Center at Harvard University and the president of the Association for Asian Studies. Since 2008, she has served as the president of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, cultivating a group of outstanding students and scholars for China studies. Our interview took place in the office of the Harvard-Yenching Institute. The office is small, and the black-and-white photos that mark important moments of this academic institution in the past century hung on the wall exude a deep sense of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Since I became president, I have spent half of my time at Harvard-Yenching Institute and the other half as a professor at Harvard.” Pei Yili is still active in teaching, every Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. At 3:30, she is open to students. Each student had to make an appointment with her in advance and explain their questions succinctly. After learning that she had given me more than three hours of interview time, her students all expressed their envy that I had such a &quot;luxury&quot; opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili has a hearty personality and is quick to talk. During the interview, he burst out laughing from time to time. Even if he fell into a gloomy look when recalling the twists and turns of his family&#39;s experiences, he would immediately ignore this emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China has undergone too many changes in the past hundred years. This may be what attracts Pei Yili, a political scientist who studies China. &quot;Studying their successes and failures is exciting and fascinating.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/QbYnyZoZXxiMPOUMUeZHcmbriNWr2fsheyj1zA8Q. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/QbYnyZoZXxiMPOUMUeZHcmbriNWr2fsheyj1zA8Q.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;257454&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pei Yili&#39;s parents&#39; wedding photo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (provided by interviewee/picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Birth under revolutionary fire&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Were you born in China?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;Why were you born in Red China?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the time I was a girl, for a long time, every time I followed the whole family back to the United States, whether at the airport or the dock, Immigration After the officer opened her passport, there was always a conversation like the one above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I would say that when I was born it was not red, just a little pink.” More than half a century later, Pei Yili was sitting in his office at the Harvard-Yenching Institute, recalling the past and couldn’t help but He let out a hearty laugh. Then, her expression became solemn. &quot;Yes, my parents both lived in troubled times in China; without the revolution, I would probably have grown up in China, so our family does have constant ties with China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili was born in a He has a strong religious family, and his parents are both missionaries of the Episcopal Church. Her father, Charles Perry - Pei Yili later learned that his Chinese name was Pan Xuesi - had studied Chinese and Japanese at Harvard University in his early years and had a special liking for East Asia. In 1931, Pan Xuesi traveled across the ocean and arrived in Shanghai to teach at St. John&#39;s University. St. John&#39;s University was founded in 1879, formerly known as St. John&#39;s College. It is sponsored by the Episcopal Church in the United States and is the earliest church university in China. After the September 18th Incident broke out, Pan Xuesi made a special trip to Northeast China. &quot;He also wrote a very interesting diary about his travel experience in Manchuria. He was very interested in this period of history.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Pan Xuesi met his future wife Kai Rui (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Note: the Chinese name is Kong Kaili&lt;/span>;) in China. Both later taught at St. John&#39;s University. Interestingly, Pei Yili never heard his parents communicate in Chinese when he was a child, &quot;because his father only knew Mandarin and his mother only knew Shanghainese.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/mEjKBtDqsDC3yeb1YmoZRw1ZwdF5aOBW6lYCyaBM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;672&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/08/mEjKBtDqsDC3yeb1YmoZRw1ZwdF5aOBW6lYCyaBM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257457&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bae Yi-ri and her father as a girl&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili’s parents got married in the summer of 1937. Because Pan Xuesi has been interested in Japanese culture for a long time, he chose to go to Japan for his honeymoon. &quot;When they were on their honeymoon, they heard the news about Japan&#39;s invasion of China, but they didn&#39;t dare to confirm it, so they went to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to ask whether the rumors were true. The embassy staff may not want to take responsibility and did not tell them the truth. They just said : No, there is no problem in China now. You can go back to China! So they boarded the ship from Nagasaki back to Shanghai as originally planned.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili said that his father liked water sports when he was young and was very fond of boats. The performance is very clear. Not long after their ship left Japanese port, my father became acutely aware that something was not quite right. He said to his wife: &quot;Strange, why is the waterline of the ship so low?&quot; He ran to the bottom to find out what was going on, and found that the bottom was full of Japanese soldiers with live ammunition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the soldiers Pei Yili&#39;s parents met back then were the regiments that had been reinforced from Japan after the Battle of Songhu began - they inadvertently became witnesses of history. As soon as these soldiers on the same ship arrived in Shanghai, they joined the war of aggression against China and became a link in the brutal machine. What awaited the young couple who returned from their honeymoon was Shanghai burned by the war. &quot;My mother later recalled that when the ship entered Shanghai, she could smell the smell of dead people everywhere. This was something she had never experienced...&quot; The parents returned to their residence at St. John&#39;s University and discovered that they were married. The chapel has been attacked by the Japanese army, the home has been ransacked, and all the wedding gifts have been stolen by Japanese soldiers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the current situation, the mother left Shanghai and returned to the United States for a while with her newborn son, while the father chose to stay at St. John&#39;s University. In 1941, the &quot;Pearl Harbor Incident&quot; broke out, the Japanese army invaded the concession, and Shanghai fell completely. Except for those who have returned to China, the rest of the foreign teachers at St. John&#39;s University were imprisoned in concentration camps, including Pei Yili&#39;s father. He was not released back to the United States until two years later when the U.S. and Japanese governments exchanged detainees. When his grandmother picked him up at the New York port, she could no longer recognize her emaciated son. But before long, Pan Xuesi hoped to return to China again. &quot;With the help of the U.S. Navy, he returned to China as he wished and helped the National Government fight the Japanese.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1945, after World War II ended, his mother also returned to China. For this family, this was a brief peaceful time in China - Pei Yili, who was born in Shanghai in September 1948, was the fruit of this life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1949, the Chinese Communist revolution had reached a decisive moment. &quot;My mother took me and my two brothers and left China first, but my father once again wanted to stay.&quot; A few months later, the situation became even more turbulent. Pan Xuesi had no choice but to bid farewell to the country where he had lived on and off for 18 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to the United States, Pan Xuesi returned to the university where he once studied and taught for several years, but the distant East has always been a place he has never forgotten. In 1951, their family moved to Tokyo, and Pan Xuesi taught at Rikkyo University, founded by the Anglican Church. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Thanksgiving night in 1959, the whole family was sitting together to eat and celebrate this traditional American holiday. Suddenly, they heard the dog barking in the yard. My father went out to check, but an accident happened unexpectedly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Two young Japanese students came in drunk. They both practiced karate... It only took a few minutes to beat my father to death... There was no plan to attack me. My father&#39;s, they were completely drunk at the time and didn&#39;t know who my father was.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This American, who had a strong interest and concern for the East throughout his life, ended his life in a sad way life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After her father died, her mother used her understanding of the world to deal with the tragedy - although her way of handling it may not be understood by most people: instead of asking for a heavy sentence for the two Japanese students, she Instead, he interceded for them. As a result, one of them was released and the other was sentenced. During his sentence, his mother not only visited him frequently, but also went to the court to fight for a commutation of his sentence. The young man only stayed in prison for two or three years before regaining his freedom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother and her family lived in Japan for several more years until they returned to the United States in 1962. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/5p8loEN1xkHBDkKV03QuMmhVUAu8H61h4WBf7px0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;645&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/5p8loEN1xkHBDkKV03QuMmhVUAu8H61h4WBf7px0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257453&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1981, Pei Yili took a photo with the interviewee in Songjiang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;Political Awareness&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Popular protests were one of her later academic interests and directions. Her initial perceptual understanding of this came from her early experience in Japan. In the early 1950s, the Communist Party of Japan and the Socialist Party of Japan would organize labor protests every May Day. That day, Pei Yili&#39;s father happened to pass by. When the protesters saw the American, they started knocking on his car window. The car was surrounded by crowds... After his father returned home, his family found that almost all the car windows were broken, and The shocked father was almost shaking. After calming down, the father tried to explain to his daughter what &quot;May Day&quot; was and what those people were protesting... This made little Pei Yili become very interested in this form of popular protest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 11, 1960, nearly 6 million Japanese took to the streets to protest against the new Japan-US security treaty. The US Embassy in Japan was surrounded by nearly 200,000 Japanese protesters. Among this huge crowd of protesters was 12-year-old Pei Yili. She skipped school, took to the streets, and participated in demonstrations against the Japan-US security treaty. In Pei Yili&#39;s understanding, the essence of this event is not &quot;anti-American&quot; but in support of peace. &quot;People seem to be very happy to have an American child participating.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a sense, this is her The first time she participated in a &quot;mass movement&quot; was also the first time she experienced the power of mass movements - the bulletproof car in which the then US Ambassador to Japan Hagerty was also surrounded by demonstrators, and the ambassador himself had to sneak in through the back door. Eisenhower, who was scheduled to visit Japan on June 19, had to postpone his visit indefinitely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a child, Pei Yili also curiously observed that in some protests, the expressions of the people were very similar to the rituals of celebrating religious festivals. For example, during religious festivals in Japan - similar to China, people will take part in a procession with a sedan chair in which a god sits and then moves around in a kind of snake dance. &quot;I liked this kind of ritual so much that I often attended Japanese folk festivals in our neighborhood. Part of my interest in political protest in Japan also came from this kind of folk ritual.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This early experience, later It became a unique perspective for her to observe political activities. For example, during her investigation into Anyuan, Jiangxi, one of the birthplaces of the Chinese revolution, she discovered how Li Lisan wisely used traditional techniques to achieve the purpose of mobilizing workers to participate in the revolution: On May 1st, International Labor Day, Li Lisan organized a workers&#39; march. &quot;In the procession, there was a large sedan carried by eight people. Generally speaking, in this kind of local celebration, the sedans are carried by the gods of the earth and other folk religions, but this time, inside the sedan was a statue of Marx. Like.&quot; This detail was used by Pei Yili to analyze the relationship between national political mobilization and traditional culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, 16-year-old Pei Yili entered William Smith College. She was quickly thrust into another turbulent political environment. Pei Yili later concluded: &quot;Although my intuitive interest in popular protest comes from my experience in Japan, my left-wing thoughts come more from my college days.&quot; She was very active in college and participated in sailing clubs, drama clubs, Political Club...but &quot;politics&quot; was her more enduring interest and more devoted concern. She remembers riding the bus to Washington with college classmates to march in front of the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also during this time that the seemingly weak connection between her and China, where she was born, became stronger in some way. William Smith College is small, but it has a &quot;Mao Zedong Thought Study Group&quot;, of which Pei Yili is a member. She studied Mao Zedong Thought with her classmates and developed a strong interest in Chinese politics. Soon, she became determined to learn Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there were no Chinese classes at her university, so she could only start learning Chinese by herself with the help of a tape recorder and a few tapes in the library. She asked the school if she could get credits for self-study in Chinese. The school’s answer: We don’t have Chinese classes, how can we evaluate your learning level and give you credits? Unwilling to give up easily, Pei Yili proposed to the school: &quot;If I learn by myself to a certain extent, I can ask a Cornell professor to test me. If I pass, can I get credits?&quot; The school had no choice but to agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili later contacted a professor at Cornell University, who said: You should study by yourself for three months through tapes and language books, and then come to Cornell to take my test. Three months later, Pei Yili successfully passed the exam. Interestingly, she later went to Taipei to study Chinese for a period of time. The Chinese teacher in Taipei grew up in Beijing. She was very surprised by the American student’s accent. One time she couldn’t help but ask: “Where does your accent come from?” Are you here? Is your teacher in the United States from the Northeast?&quot; &quot;I deny it. I want to say that my teacher is a &#39;recorder&#39; and not a Northeastern, but at that time I didn&#39;t know how to say the word &#39;recorder&#39;!&quot; Recalling this incident , Pei Yili was overjoyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese name &quot;Pei Yili&quot; was given while studying in Taipei. Much later, when she was looking at her father&#39;s book and saw the Chinese stamp on it, she discovered that her father&#39;s Chinese name was &quot;Pan Xuesi&quot;. &quot;So my surname should be Pan instead of Pei.&quot; Speaking of this matter, Pei Yili showed a trace of regret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/WA5K5OwMwAXvSYgB2p4r65LJ0k64mD4kkdoi24OA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/WA5K5OwMwAXvSYgB2p4r65LJ0k64mD4kkdoi24OA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257450&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Pursuit The Origin of the Chinese Revolution&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When he was studying for a doctorate in political science at the University of Michigan, Pei Yili&#39;s original idea was to use China&#39;s &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; as the topic of his doctoral thesis, but he was opposed by a supervisor. The teacher thinks the time is not yet ripe. She instead determined to explore the origins of the Chinese revolution using perspectives and methods that were different from the prevailing views at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“How to understand the peasant revolution is an issue that has been ignored by many scientific scholars who pay attention to peasant issues.” When explaining the motivation for her research, she said, “Peasants entered world history in the face of revolution. This fact of the stage has fueled the development of many social science theories that attempt to explain the causes of peasant rebellions. Anthropologists, historians, sociologists, and political scientists have all come up with their own answers to this important question.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;At this time, Pei Yili has revealed her &quot;academic ambition&quot;: she decided to examine the relationship between rebels and revolutionaries through the study of a region. The plan had to be concentrated in an area that had both a tradition of peasant rebellion and a pre-1949 Communist base. She chose this area in Huaibei. Huaibei was also the center of the famous White Lotus Sect, a loose folk religious organization that launched many rebellions in the region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, China’s door was still locked. Like other scholars, she chose to go to the National Palace Museum in Taipei to look at archives. During this period, she also went to Japan to collect information in a library in Tokyo. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I was so young and naive at the time, and had no idea how difficult this topic was—otherwise I would never have been stupid enough to choose this direction for my thesis.” There was another hearty laugh. Although she was fortunate to receive help from many people, including several American historians who were doing research there who gave her a lot of advice, Professor Albert Feuerwerker, another famous scholar of Chinese history at the University of Michigan, was also careful She was told the location of various Ming and Qing archives, but, &quot;I had no idea that the original sources on this subject were so scattered and their types were so different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another barrier was language. Although she systematically studied Chinese, including classical Chinese, for two years when she was a graduate student, she had never received special training in reading Qing Dynasty documents like those historians from the United States. So when she saw the Qing Dynasty archives at the National Palace Museum in Taipei for the first time, she was almost overwhelmed by despair: &quot;I will never be able to understand these archives!&quot; In her reply, the instructor said in a tone that could not be flinched: &quot;You have to completely Do research on original archives, and you have to read everything.&quot; Pei Yili also knew that the instructor did not understand classical Chinese and had no idea of ​​the difficulty of reading and sorting out Ming and Qing archives, but she still followed his advice. There was no way out now. She found that after really getting into it, she was completely capable of reading those files. &quot;We can see almost all the original documents you know in Taipei back then. For example, you can take the memorial written by the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi to Xianfeng, which contains the instructions of Emperor Xianfeng, &#39;I understand.&#39; When you feel this way , it doesn’t matter how obscure the file content is.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on solid work, Pei Yili completed her doctoral thesis. In 1980, the monograph &quot;Rebels and Revolutionaries in North China&quot; based on the thesis was published at Stanford University. This monograph is regarded as the representative work of the third generation of overseas Chinese scholars. Pei Yili dedicated his first book to his parents, &quot;Without them, I would not be engaged in Chinese studies.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/11/08/XDBAeBrYfBKDdVmYZ9OQbRemzezD2UyCKWonhdJJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/08/XDBAeBrYfBKDdVmYZ9OQbRemzezD2UyCKWonhdJJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257455&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Return to China&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Were you born in China?&quot; Every time I return to the United States, I enter the customs Shi&#39;s cross-examination once made Pei Yili feel like a &quot;second-class American.&quot; This scene did not change until 1972, the year President Nixon visited China. Pei Yili remembers very clearly that when she returned from a trip to Japan that year and entered the United States, as usual, the immigration officer opened her passport and asked this question as expected, and Pei Yili answered in the affirmative as usual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was waiting for the next question: &#39;Why were you born in Red China?&#39; But unexpectedly, this time the other person&#39;s reaction was: &#39;Oh, that&#39;s amazing! Can you speak Chinese?&#39; I said : &#39;Yes, I will say a little bit.&#39; He said: &#39;Our country needs people like you.&#39; That was the first time I was happy that I was born in China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中After the thaw in U.S. relations, the National Committee on Us-China Relations began to send delegations to visit China one after another. Each delegation was accompanied by a scholar who studied China to help members understand China. In June 1979, Pei Yili was selected to join the delegation of big city mayors in the United States. She visited cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, and saw the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and the West Lake with her own eyes... She was extremely excited. &quot;I get up early every day and go to the park to talk to the local people. I like this feeling very much.&quot; But on the other hand, she felt that the China she saw was not the China that was filled with revolutionary and romantic imagination before. Pei Yili also went to Shanghai to find their old house at St. John&#39;s University, took many photos of the campus, and brought them back to the United States to show his mother. Not surprisingly, my mother was extremely shocked and also extremely sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few months later, Pei Yili came to China again. This time she was a visiting scholar and was given the opportunity to study in China for a year - she was also the first group allowed to enter China for fieldwork. One of the foreign scholars who studied it, Zhou Xirui and Huang Zongzhi came to China at the same time as her, and they later became the backbone of overseas Chinese studies. She also experienced the &quot;voucher era&quot; under the planned economy. &quot;We treated each other as comrades and often quoted Chairman Mao&#39;s quotations in debates on academic and political issues.&quot; But behind the revolutionary upsurge, she gradually discovered Another side. For example, as a foreigner, she can sit on a soft sleeper, which ordinary Chinese people cannot enjoy; there are very few restaurants open to the outside world, but &quot;visiting scholars&quot; like her can enjoy &quot;special offerings&quot; in special areas of restaurants, which ordinary Chinese people cannot enjoy. Not enough, and can&#39;t afford it. In the spring of 1980, accompanied by Professor Cai Shaoqing of Nanjing University, Pei Yili went to Anhui for her first investigation. The field visits in Guoyang and Mengcheng gave her a more personal experience of the real life in rural China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One year, when Pei Yili came to Shanghai for a meeting, she met Zhang Zhongli, then president of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Zhang graduated from St. John&#39;s University in his early years and happened to be her father&#39;s student at that time. After meeting, they introduced each other to the work they were doing. After hearing Pei Yili&#39;s work plan for the next book, Zhang Zhongli joked: &quot;You are from Shanghai - I saw your father holding you on campus many years ago. Why not write the story of Shanghai?&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;在张仲礼的建议下，自1990年代起，裴宜理的研究目光从遥远的淮北农村转向世界大都会上海，研究重点也从农民革命问题研究变为工人运动研究。她完成了专著《上海罢工：中国工人政治研究》，在这本书里，她也用不少笔墨写了杜月笙、黄金荣这些我们并不陌生的人物，挖掘了他们在工人运动中所扮演的一些真实的角色。这本书获得了1993年美国历史学会费正清奖。 《美国历史评论》评价她兼具“社会科学家对秩序的热爱”与“历史学家捕捉精彩故事的眼睛”。在写这本书时，裴宜理对涉及的劳工阶层做了详尽的调查和分析，其中也包括英美烟草公司。快要结束这本书时，她突然意识到，英美烟草公司在浦东的工厂，就是父亲当年被关押的集中营。 “我没想到，我所研究的对象在某种程度上与我自己家族的历史有非常密切的联系。所以我后来在《上海罢工》英文版序言里的第一句话写道：&#39;对我来说，写作本书有一种回家的感觉。&#39;”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nmo7yEYcHen9ErQmaxrlIictm9QBHdxe28utFf3H.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nmo7yEYcHen9ErQmaxrlIictm9QBHdxe28utFf3H.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257459&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;裴宜理与南京大学教授周晓虹在安徽历史博物馆参观&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;不能忘记“大问题”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;实际上，无论是早期对农民革命的兴趣，还是后来转向对城市工人运动的研究，那些改变了无数人命运的革命，始终是裴宜理关注的大问题。著名历史学家周锡瑞在接受采访时，提过这样一个细节：2007年，裴宜理当选亚洲研究学会主席发表演讲时说，“我们不能忘记中国革命，不能忘记这些大题目，不能忘记如何来理解中国这个大转变到底是怎么发生的。”周锡瑞后来将自己的一本专著送给裴宜理，请她提意见。裴宜理回信给他，再一次说：“我们应该多思考中国的大问题。”——这其实既是裴宜理对同时代做中国研究的学者的期待，也是她对自己时时刻刻的告诫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了学术研究，裴宜理还积极参与公共事务和社会活动。 1999年，到哈佛大学不久，裴宜理即出任海外中国学研究重镇费正清中国研究中心（Fairbank Center for China Studies）的主任。在她名字之前，是费正清、史华慈、孔飞力、傅高义等一系列著名学者；自2008年起，裴宜理又成为另一个分量颇重的学术机构的掌门人——哈佛燕京学社社长。作为最著名的中西学术交流机构之一，哈佛燕京自1928年创立以来已经历了七任社长，从叶理绥、赖肖尔到杜维明等，每一任都是德高望重的学者。裴宜理在学界的地位和影响力可见一斑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;裴宜理的研究重点是“中国革命”，这在西方的中国研究学界也许有点“非主流”。所以她当选后面对记者的采访，也有感而发：“在很长一段时间里，美国专门研究中国革命的只有区区十几人。这几年，研究中国革命的人又多了起来，毛泽东、&#39;大跃进&#39;、&#39;文革&#39;、抗日战争……都成了热门。”她打趣说：“否则，像我这种研究冷僻课题的家伙估计成不了哈佛燕京的新社长！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美大门打开、中国重新融入世界大家庭之后，商业和经济上的复兴与繁荣或许是最显性最直接的成果。但裴宜理感受更多的，是它在知识与学术交流上产生的巨大意义。过去的一个多世纪，从大清帝国时期到中华民国时期、再进入中华人民共和国，这块土地上发生了太多太大的变化，这或许正是吸引裴宜理研究中国的地方，“它们是如此复杂，又是如此迷人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[陕西回应强砍国槐树事件：属违规占用永久基本农田]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260438]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 19:24:52&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;针对网传“陕西丹凤县强砍3万多棵国槐树”一事，当地已成立由县农业农村局、县资源局、县林业局等单位组成的调查组实地调查。丹凤县有关部门11月11日发布调查结果如下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经查，反映问题地点位于丹凤县蔡川镇太子庙村。2023年7月3日，蔡川镇接到丹凤县田长办《永久基本农田疑似图斑问题整改交办单》，反馈太子庙村3个卫星图斑疑似违法占用永久基本农田，要求限期整改。经实地调查，反馈图斑涉及的耕地上栽种有核桃树、国槐，确属违规占用永久基本农田。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接到整改通知后，镇村工作人员多次向涉及群众宣讲耕地保护政策，动员配合支持耕地保护工作，并根据《土地管理法》《基本农田保护条例》法律法规，当场下发限期整改通知书，其中3名群众拒绝限期整改。随后，镇村干部多次到地块实地查看，帮助对接销售，减少群众损失，但因其栽种苗木密度过大，且大面积形成干腐病，无企业采购。之后，镇村干部多次上门沟通未果，上述3名群众拒绝限期整改。11月2日，蔡川镇政府会同县农业执法大队，对在永久基本农田上违规种植的核桃树、国槐苗木进行清除复耕。因在涉及地块上种植苗木属违法违规占用永久基本农田，不涉及赔偿事项。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
