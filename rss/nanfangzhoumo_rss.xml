Most of the short 8-kilometer mountain road has turned into mud. It took more than half an hour to reach the destination of Qielongzhong Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/s223DyoKGhAH9HgEQMPovK7JAk2OrbNVCC45vB0f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/s223DyoKGhAH9HgEQMPovK7JAk2OrbNVCC45vB0f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170797&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Farmers resting among the terraces of Qielong Zhongzhai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Hailu/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;39 The 20-year-old Che Zhixiong picked me up at the door of my house and helped me carry my luggage up to the Datongbu room on the third floor of my old house. This is for investigators from all over the world doing ethnoanthropological research. Different from the village youths, he went to Gejiu, a major town in southern Yunnan, to work for two years before he was 20 years old. He then returned to the village and worked as a team leader and veterinarian. Six years ago, he began to organize nearby left-behind children and teach them to sing and dance traditional Hani. Song and dance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Puchun, the administrative village to which Qielong Zhongzhai belongs, is the birthplace of Hani multi-part folk songs, a national intangible cultural heritage, and Che Zhixiong’s father, Che Kesan, is the provincial inheritor. . In 2018, after attending the one-week village imaging training class of &quot;Village Eyes&quot; in the county seat, Che Zhixiong excitedly set up a Canon DV distributed by a charity organization, shot and recorded the life and festivals of Qielongzhong Village, and then recorded his The edited materials are saved to the hard drive for researchers from Kunming to take away when they come over. &quot;In the past three years, two 4T hard drives have been filled up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another house opposite the residence is Che Zhixiong&#39;s new home. . Last summer, with the help of 40,000 yuan in project start-up funds donated by a caring fan of Wang Yibo, Brother Che emptied the first floor and repainted it, turning it into a &quot;local imaging and cultural transmission hall.&quot; On the wall between the load-bearing columns, two LCD TVs are hung. The station at the door was broadcasting a CCTV set of the rice-planting gate opening ceremony filmed and produced in the village. When the rice-planting girl marries the young man from the field in early spring, the villagers who plant the rice-planting are all the bridesmaids and best men. Planting the rice-planting in a good field means marrying into a good family. Che Kesan frequently appears in the camera. As the ditch leader, he has to strictly measure the proportion of each ditch dug to ensure that the water from the forest reservoir flows fairly and accurately into the field ridges of each household. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The TV inside is Che Zhixiong&#39;s own &quot;Personal Film Exhibition&quot;. The sudden heavy hailstorm, the city children who came here for study tours, and the slaughter of cattle to worship the gods during the &quot;June Year&quot;, each section is an anthropological documentary with a complete narrative and clear rhythm. &quot;Most of my peers don&#39;t understand so many Hani rituals, let alone children. I only have a third-grade elementary school education, and all I can do is film and edit all the festivals here,&quot; Village Eyes &#39;People then use it to add subtitles. As for Kuaishou Douyin, it may occasionally attract attention, but it is not complete and even the surface is not captured.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;New documentary director Che Zhixiong, Talk about your creative passion. He then pointed to the &quot;One Year&#39;s Festival Ritual&quot; display board on the wall between the two LCD TVs. For example, in the first month of the lunar calendar, the Hani people hold Lazuozuo and Angmatu successively, both of which are sacrificial ceremonies for the dead. &quot;Our ancestors will turn into little gods after they die, and they may come back to harass us. After death, the little gods will turn into great gods, and only then will they bless us. We kill cows for sacrifice to ensure that they can turn into great gods. . When the great god dies, it turns into dew, which drips down at night to irrigate the terraced fields and breed new life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It happened that an old man in the village was about to leave, so the driver took me to where the villagers kept watch. room. All the middle-aged and elderly people who stayed behind gathered here. The woman was in the back room, and the man was on the terrace, drinking pot-stewing wine just scooped out of a sealed earthen vat, chewing green chili peppers dipped in chili oil, and chatting in Hani dialect. The old man who smoked hookah encouraged me to be more generous, &quot;Go inside with your phone and take pictures.&quot; The daughter of the deceased man came back and told me, &quot;She is 80 years old, there is no need to stay in the hospital and suffer, let everyone have fun It&#39;s our tradition to stay with you.&quot; Later, most people would go home and sleep, but there would always be someone staying with them to wait for the final moments. Che Zhixiong carried the old man on his back, and while watching him the documentary he shot on TV, he told me, &quot;The bema (shaman) in the village will calculate the exact day to leave, and the funeral will begin three days before.&quot; . The posthumous affairs are more grand, and one or twenty cows may have to be killed and raised in the underworld for the deceased. This is not an exaggeration. Each of the children will have one, and if the spouse and family members have others, the beef will be taken back to their respective villages to be divided. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/KMYD8TnYTGxWjDJ86KztQRUsymuqNaITsvoEvg58.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height =&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/KMYD8TnYTGxWjDJ86KztQRUsymuqNaITsvoEvg58.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170799&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Che Longzhong Village keeps vigil at night.

Less than ten children would go to the village every night to learn Hani dance from Che Zhixiong. The popular song &quot;Honey Baby&quot; with a hip-hop style has become a &quot;county dance&quot; vigorously promoted by Honghe primary and secondary schools, and children never tire of dancing it. The &quot;Music and Dance&quot; that has been passed down from our ancestors in production and life is more popular among energetic children because of its rich routines of squatting, jumping, lining up and circling. Accompanied by the cheerful beats and high-fives, I also followed the Hani cattle herding class and entered a selfless state of joy with nature and heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/XmocXYbwdYdsfRySlzFt7Cj6I1znT2WNT8ANQcNk.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/XmocXYbwdYdsfRySlzFt7Cj6I1znT2WNT8ANQcNk.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170800&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Che Zhixiong teaches children music and dance in the village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Hailu/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;The young people of Yisa Town dedicated their entire youth to musical instruments&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Honghe County Government The town of Yisa is located at the top of a hill where two winding asphalt roads meet. At the highest edge of the ancient city, starting from the east gate with three floors and three rooms, a large and majestic ancient castle that combines Chinese and Western styles spreads out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a masonry town brought on horseback by local business gangs 90 years ago, and the primitive tribes who practiced slash-and-burn farming, carved wood and knotted ropes were upgraded into &quot;Little Shanghai outside the Yangtze River&quot;. Jiang refers to the Red River that flows to Vietnam and divides Red River Prefecture into two. Places such as Jianshui and Mengzi, which have many Han immigrants and are economically developed, are in the north and are called inside the river; while counties such as Yuanyang, Honghe and Luchun, which have developed world heritage terraced landscapes, are outside the river, which is backward. Yisa means &quot;drought and water shortage&quot; in the dialect of the Yi people who first came here to open up wasteland. During the Qianlong period, copper mines were discovered in the mountains, and immigrants followed the mining industry. These ancestors also experienced a history of prosperity and decline with the Qing Dynasty. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the copper mines dried up and the new mountain people had no land to cultivate. They had to drag horses and go deep into the mountains and forests of Southeast Asia to do trade. They gradually developed from traditional caravans to tobacco gangs. In the early years of the Republic of China, the government&#39;s vigorous crackdown on opium led to a sharp increase in black market profits. Cigarette gangs organized and strengthened private militia to safeguard their vested interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/QislqJmk9cSDUoAKbbAG0tgxBY4Qsgb2olkGz6R6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/QislqJmk9cSDUoAKbbAG0tgxBY4Qsgb2olkGz6R6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170802&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; The French designers I knew drew drawings and hired Jiangnan craftsmen to build various stone mansions with European-style exteriors and Chinese-style interiors, row upon row on the hills. Since then, more men have dispersed overseas and reorganized their families, making Honghe County the second largest hometown of overseas Chinese in Yunnan, with more than 10,000 overseas Chinese distributed in 18 countries and regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wave of overseas immigrants on horseback has long been replaced by the wave of designated labor exports. But there are always people who insist on staying behind, such as Awen, the traditional musical instrument maker and inheritor I met at the east gate. &quot;Do you understand Honghe dialect? I can&#39;t speak Mandarin.&quot; Awen confessed in advance on WeChat. The craftsman who doesn’t speak Mandarin must be an old man with a white beard smoking a hookah, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the bluestone road, the roaring Aprilia 150 motorcycle turned off its engine. The &quot;white vest&quot; on the car took off the helmet with the three colors of the Italian flag. The cool guy with a ponytail stepped forward and said, &quot;I That’s Ah Wen.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I went from the village to the county cultural center to work when I was sixteen or seventeen years old. Now I am 35 years old, and I have dedicated all my youth to musical instruments.” In the restaurant next to Daguangtang in the center of the ancient town, Ah Wen Wen continued to introduce himself. &quot;I quit my job last year. I know nothing but making musical instruments. I&#39;m so hurt by music!&quot; Although he was a little sad, when he was flipping through the various beautiful instruments on his phone, Awen became excited again, &quot;I ride a motorcycle. When I visited various villages in Hani, I couldn&#39;t put it down when I saw these treasures. Every sanxian and every straw have different materials, appearance and sound quality. They can&#39;t be made in factories. They will be gone when the older generation leaves. I can only Take photos and videos, listen to the sounds, and restore them all.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After dinner, we walked through the lush Xishan Park and walked to the musical instrument workshop next to the County Cultural Center. Master Wu Zhiming was lying on a bamboo chair. When he heard me say that he had just come from Qielong Zhongzhai, memories of his life came back to him, &quot;It can be said that it was them who started my career, and I played a role as a link between past and future.&quot; 1986 In May, when Wu Zhiming, who was employed by the County Culture and Sports Bureau, went to Puchun to collect folk music, he heard the eight-part chorus of rice-planting girls coming from a distance, and followed the sound to find it... Later, he changed from a county actor to a song and dance creator. and music theory researchers, and brought Hani singing and dancing to the world. Ah Wen and Che Zhixiong have traveled as far as Shandong and Beijing respectively, but their master and father have already traveled to Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and the Netherlands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/tVMULXeHWW8OLcd8NgjmsJDwCvNAXOyQAPZFErVa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/tVMULXeHWW8OLcd8NgjmsJDwCvNAXOyQAPZFErVa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170798&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Awen from Yisa Town Musical Instrument Making Workshop&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Hailu/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Like those young and middle-aged people in the city who are separated from their work units and pursue personal values, Awen also worries about how to monetize his hobbies. &quot;Many scholars and teachers can only provide spiritual support, but &#39;Village Eyes&#39; has raised 10,000 to 20,000 yuan for me.&quot; . But there are many others, but even a small business loan of 50,000 yuan cannot be approved.&quot; With the capital, Awen can build his own studio and improve the efficiency of working all night and three days to make two sanxian. One piece. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You still have to be realistic and start with a wind instrument that saves time and materials. Although it is not as good as the cucurbit flutes in the pedestrian streets of ancient cities, you should try to reduce the production cost first, and then put it into Go to the Samaba Visitor Center to try out the sales.&quot; Xu Tianming, an old colleague who still works at the County Cultural Center, reminded him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Tianming is from the Yi ethnic group. In June 2021, under the guidance of the state song and dance troupe, he and other colleagues rehearsed the first courtyard drama &quot;Caravan Women&quot; in Honghe Prefecture. The Wanxing Courtyard was staged by relying on money. As the name of the play suggests, it tells the stories of chaste women displayed in this mansion. The dancers, from the image of disgraced grooms at the beginning, jumped to become a men&#39;s team in suits returning home joyfully, and the girls who looked through the love finally became the old mothers holding a revolving door, looking forward to the return of their husbands. Although the over-an-hour play is in a very complete musical format, it is not an original performance and is reduced to a series of popular Han-style compositions. Moreover, because the fee is not enough, embarrassing copyright information often comes out of the soundtrack. . Everything is difficult at the beginning. The ticket agent told me that starting with their play, all the counties and cities in Honghe Prefecture will create their own courtyard dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Hollowed Village, a Holiday Paradise for City People&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Xu Tianming suggested that Awen go to Samaba, which sells bamboo flutes. It is located at the end of the gently undulating hillside and is the most famous place in Honghe County. The scenic area has more than 14,000 acres of the world&#39;s largest concentrated contiguous terraces with more than 4,300 levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/zSqER3Vy9QkygwFuAaj3LctdJc5PEjeLIwS8jiab.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/zSqER3Vy9QkygwFuAaj3LctdJc5PEjeLIwS8jiab.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170801&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Samaba Terraces&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Hailu/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A on the other side of the landscape terraces Although Yinxiang is the birthplace of the 600-year-old Hani Street Festival, the most beautiful historical and cultural village &quot;Zuofu&quot; failed to retain a few mushroom houses with ethnic characteristics and was replaced by reinforced concrete. house. Of course, there is nothing wrong with pursuing a once-and-for-all residence, but &quot;it is good to leave many old things in the village and tidy them up. For example, at the east gate of the county, the two mansions of Yao and Qian were used as public prosecutors and detention centers respectively before they became museums. It has always been used as a reservation.&quot; Liu Zhigang, who manages Kangteng·Honghehe Valley Tent Camp deep in Jiayin Township, as an outside operator, has a relatively objective and neutral voice on rural protection and development issues, &quot;and it is not far from Jiayin Township. There is a Tusi Mansion, and it is very grandiose. It could not have been so grand before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conten Company, which creates high-end vacation products, chose the project outside the scenic area because it had to find convenience for renovation. of hollowed out villages. &quot;Shitou Village has been empty for more than ten years. There are only one or two families who have owned houses in the new village. They use the old houses to store farm tools. It is not difficult for us to use them as campsites.&quot; Liu Zhigang is now busy developing another hollow village. , Suhong Village in the core area of ​​Samaba Rice Terraces. To this end, a tourism investment company has been established with the county government, and famous architect Zhang Yonghe has been hired as the chief planner to create timeshare real estate based on the &quot;low-involvement&quot; concept to allow urbanites to live in rural areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the heavy rain, the county road from the camp to Suhong Village was completely cut off by mudslides, and we had to climb down the narrow village road with hundreds of turns. The landscape along the road gradually changes from the rain-watered mulberry trees and red chrysanthemums at high altitudes to the steaming dense banana forest with broad leaves covering the sky. In the past, the smoke-traveling gang probably often did this, shuttling back and forth between alpine mountains and tropical dense forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/KYbublnB4r6wgP8I0WqZ0Dbqr5qVHJX5SbkP4LJZ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/KYbublnB4r6wgP8I0WqZ0Dbqr5qVHJX5SbkP4LJZ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170804&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A corner of Suhong Village&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Hailu/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Hani people’s hoes are But the enemy&#39;s iron gun. Seven thousand women have become widows, seven thousand children can&#39;t see their parents, the high swings have been knocked down, and the three-story mushroom houses have been burned down.&quot; An ancient Hani song once lamented the ancestors The fate of being defeated all the way and moving southward. After finally settling in the &quot;two mountains and three rivers&quot; area consisting of Ailao Mountain, Wuliang Mountain, Lancang River, Yuanjiang River and Honghe River, with the help of my good friend Old Buffalo, we dug out magnificent terraces with hoe after hoe. Nowadays, except for a few local people who work in the camp due to the demand for original ecological services, for more Honghe youths like Awen who stay in their hometown, city people come to experience the terraced life of transplanting rice seedlings, harvesting in autumn, and setting up tents. It&#39;s so familiar that it won&#39;t be rare. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;People chasing hometown&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The NAS system of the computer in the Kunming office of &quot;Village Eyes&quot; stores a large number of documentaries shot by Che Zhixiong. This is a public welfare organization that helps farmers and herdsmen in western rural areas record the ecological and cultural changes in their hometown through their own ethnic perspective and using cameras as tools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person who introduced Che Zhixiong to me was Li Xudong, a young man from his hometown who had just graduated more than a year ago. &quot;I studied hotel management at a private university. After graduation, I worked as a housekeeper in a high-end B&amp;B in Dali for two months. In August last year, I saw someone posting the official account &#39;Village Eyes&#39; in one of my most active groups. I was attracted to this charity organization after reading an article about Hani’s cattle herding class.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the male classmates in the village who went out to work and the female classmates who married early, Adong, who was born in 1996, They are very few young people who have a conscious sense of national identity early on. “Since my sophomore year, from January to April every year, I have taken leave, hitchhiked home from Kunming, participated in organizing the grand Silhouette Festival, written event planning, served as host, worked as a financial accountant, and dressed in national costumes , followed the horn team, taking the children who no longer have contact with the seedlings, to play in the terraced fields. This festival is a rest and entertainment time for the Hani people after planting the spring seedlings, and they also look forward to the rich autumn harvest in a few months.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;A Dong also cooperates with four friends to operate a public account - People Chasing Hometown.

The late well-known archaeologist Su Bingqi, who proposed the &quot;starry sky&quot; theory about the origin of Chinese civilization, once said that what we want to build is a modernization with Chinese characteristics commensurate with the ancient country of five thousand years of civilization. This naturally puts forward the idea of ​​five thousand years of civilization. What is the essence, what is the national soul, and what is the spiritual pillar? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concept of &quot;Chinese nation&quot; was proposed by Liang Qichao a hundred years ago, but even starting from the Liangzhu Culture characterized by jade culture, the civilization creation of our ancestors on the land of China has exceeded 5000 years. The Liangzhu ancestors’ divine and animal facial patterns, head-up and head-down dragons, and tomb forms with obvious ritual connotations, all clearly show that they are an important source of Chinese civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese civilization naturally has more than one origin. In addition to the Liangzhu Culture in the Taihu Lake area, there are also the Hongshan Culture in western Liaoning, the Yangshao Culture in the Central Plains, the Pengtoushan-Chengbeixi Culture in the Yangtze River Basin, the Longshan Culture that is a fusion of various cultures in China, and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The basic spirit of Chinese civilization has gradually formed in the historical development, including the invention of square characters, the &quot;work&quot; of the &quot;system&quot; of the previous kings in the actual social development form, and the &quot;narration&quot; of the previous teachers, as well as The &quot;interpretation&quot; of scholars and intellectuals of all dynasties. Whether it is the &quot;new underground materials&quot; that are advancing rapidly in the modern era or the rich ancient documents dating back to Oracle Bone Inscriptions and Bronze Inscriptions, they can all help us today understand more deeply what the &quot;Chinese national spirit&quot; is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this understanding cannot only be directed towards the past. Although Zhou is an old state, its destiny is renewed. It is facing the future and participating in the present. Here, I try to summarize what I understand about Chinese civilization from five aspects: society, politics, faith, economy, and culture and education. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Society: Family Orientation and Individuality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From a social perspective, we attach great importance to the value of a small community such as &quot;family&quot;, which leads to the spirit of benevolence and individual personality. growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benevolent people are the most important to people who are close to each other. To be close means to be filial to one&#39;s parents, to be kind to one&#39;s children, and to be friendly to one&#39;s brothers and sisters based on human blood and nature. And &quot;Old people are like the old people, young people are like the young people&quot;, and this kind of love is extended to everyone. Different from Mohism’s proposition of universal love, as the mainstream of Han culture, Confucianism admits that “there are differences in love”, but it still has a feeling of universal love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern people tend to value individualism first. Does this kind of &quot;familism&quot; conflict with respect for individual personality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a motivational point of view, parents raising their children comes from their own nature and is the best natural mechanism to help individuals grow. Family love provides relatively pure love and good emotions between parents and children. In terms of children&#39;s growth, the family structure can provide more support. From the perspective of ethnic continuity, this culture is obviously beneficial to increasing fertility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dear love does not advocate unconditional submission. If parents are at fault, the &quot;Book of Filial Piety&quot; advocates that &quot;there are faults in the family&quot;, but it only advises parents to pay attention to their attitude and methods. Mencius encouraged everyone to &quot;nurture my awe-inspiring spirit&quot; and &quot;even if there are thousands of people, I will go there&quot;. It is a kind of personalism with abundant independent consciousness and free spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although in reality there are overbearing and irresponsible parents and rebellious children, this is precisely because they have betrayed the love of their relatives and cannot be blamed on this kind of balancing of family structure and individual personality. The social structure and value form of development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Family, a small community, constitutes a social unit, and the independent individuals with community and public care bred in it have become the foundation of the country. The laws promulgated by the governor should encourage this kind of love, but not destroy it. If conditions are created to make it easier for parents to raise their children and for children to get closer to their parents, it is care that nourishes this spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Political ideal: The world is for the common good&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the mainstream of our culture, individuals not only live within the family structure, but also naturally extend to the country and the world. To cultivate oneself, manage one&#39;s family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world, in &quot;The Great Learning&quot;, individuals need to constantly study things to gain knowledge, be sincere and righteous, and expand their areas of concern and efforts to the vast areas of the country and the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When someone asked Confucius why he did not engage in politics, Confucius quoted &quot;Shangshu&quot; and replied: &quot;Filial piety is only filial piety, and friendship is with brothers.&quot; Politics? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such a social structure and cultural spirit, &quot;keeping the family together&quot; is already a part of public affairs. Expanding this spirit to a wider social space is also &quot;for government&quot; rather than for government. You must &quot;serve as an official in the government&quot; to enter politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern families are families of three or four, but in Chinese history, unless official laws deliberately required &quot;family separation&quot; to weaken the organizational strength of small communities, our culture often praised &quot;multi-generational families&quot;. &quot;Together under the same roof&quot; encourages large families to live together and help each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of large family living together combines the principles of &quot;kinship&quot;, &quot;respect for respect&quot; and &quot;virtue&quot; to form the social autonomy of a small community. From this, the tradition of gentry autonomy was derived. This made it possible to create a &quot;small government, big society&quot; where the imperial power did not extend to the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Zhou system of feudalism and founding of the country directly used family as a link to establish the basic political order of the entire Chinese world: on the one hand, the eldest son inheritance system was implemented to ensure the institutionalization and stability of the inheritance of power; On the one hand, talented people are selected to govern. Of course, the Zhou system still embodies moral governance in the family and the world, and the degree of openness of power is still limited. In the political field, the value that best embodies the spirit of the Chinese nation is the spirit of &quot;the world is for the common good.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original text of &quot;Book of Rites&quot; is: In the journey of the great road, the world is for the common good, selecting talents and talents, adhering to trust and cultivating harmony, old friends do not only kiss their relatives, do not only give birth to their children, so that the old will die well. The strong have their uses, the young have their talents, and those who are modest, widowed, lonely, and lonely are all supported... Another example is &quot;The king and his ministers are united by righteousness.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not all about the same surname&quot;... These political thoughts, which exude eternal brilliance, have broken through the &quot;kinship&quot; principle of the family and become a concrete manifestation of the commonwealth of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since selfish desires are difficult to eliminate, it is extremely difficult to achieve the goal of serving the world for the common good. Needless to say, the Qin system, from the Han and Tang dynasties to the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, the separation of imperial power and prime ministerial power, the system of admonishing officials and historians, the feudal system throughout the Han, Tang, and Song dynasties, the education of princes, and the system of co-governance of scholar-bureaucrats, etc., are only partial and It plays a certain role in the short term. Royal power is never truly under the law. The Chinese nation’s political spirit of “the world is for the common good” is so premature and yet so immature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the famous &quot;Debate between Righteousness, Benefit and Overlord&quot; with Chen Liang, Zhu Xi lamented decisively: For fifteen hundred years, he was just sitting on this, so it was just a matter of time to make up for it. Although there may have been some moderate prosperity during this period, the Tao taught by the three kings Yao and Shun, Zhou Gong and Confucius, has not yet been practiced in heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the political standard of the world for the common good continues to exist. Whether to put the interests and happiness of the people first in governance, and whether to keep the economic, social and spiritual life vigorous and prosperous? These political requirements for governors are also an important dimension of Chinese civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Economy: People have permanent property&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the economy, how does &quot;the world is for the common good&quot; be reflected? For the government, it is &quot;the king, why should he call it profit&quot;. From the emperor, princes to officials, managers at all levels should not compete with the people for profit; for the common people, it is &quot;those who have permanent property have perseverance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to do this specifically? What the government wants to do is to &quot;benefit the people according to their interests&quot; and naturally carry out production, trade and consumption activities based on the needs of the people in the world. Therefore, in the choice between cannon and butter, butter obviously takes precedence. This only requires the establishment of a service-oriented government that provides &quot;benefits at no cost&quot; and cannot compete with the people for profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Benevolent government must start from the borders.” The basis for the interests of the people is to ensure that citizens have their own three-acre land, and they can use their own land according to their personal and family interests. Judgment, to produce and trade. Although Mencius&#39;s proposition mainly focused on delimiting the boundaries of mine fields, its essence pointed to the determination of property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, Mencius also advocated encouraging commerce and protecting travelers by providing warehouses for merchants and requisitioning them in accordance with the law to avoid stagnant goods, only registering and inspecting but not collecting taxes, only doing labor service but not collecting land rent, etc. Let it be beneficial to farmers, so that all merchants in the world will be happy and willing to hide in their markets, all travelers in the world will be happy and willing to go out on their own roads, and all farmers in the world will be happy and willing to plow their fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as the current economic reform is concerned, the confirmation and long-term stability of agricultural land rights, as well as deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises, protecting the investment and property rights of the private economy in various fields, tax laws, etc., all fall into this category. economic issues. This also determines whether entrepreneurs have long-term confidence in the Chinese economy and whether they dare to make large investments. In short, the essence of the economic spirit of an ideal Chinese community is to achieve economic prosperity, prosperity and prosperity for the people, and ensure the material life of the people through the property rights, production and trade system of &quot;big public ownership and private ownership&quot; and the fiscal and taxation system that is light on corvee and light on taxes. of plenty. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Belief: The unity of nature and man&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For families, why should fathers be kind and sons should be filial? For rulers, why should the world be for the common good? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do ordinary people have perseverance only if they have perseverance? For a person like Yan Hui, why can he achieve &quot;a basket of food and a ladle of drink, and he cannot bear the worries, but his joy will not change even after he returns&quot;? How can he have perseverance without permanent income? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This involves the fourth dimension of Chinese civilization, faith. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Businessmen believed in the personified &quot;Emperor&quot; and were biased toward the dominating heaven; Zhou people believed in &quot;the destiny of heaven is constant, only virtue is the supplementary one&quot;, and in the dominating heaven there was a profound meaning of the heaven of righteousness; although Confucius &quot;revered &quot;Keep the ghosts and gods at a distance&quot;, but still &quot;offer sacrifices to the gods as if they were present&quot;, reminding the disciples to realize the sincere spirit of life from the great popularity of &quot;Heaven can say nothing&quot;, and firmly believe that they carry &quot;Heaven will not lose the grace&quot;, which deepened the Zhou people&#39;s The concept of destiny; in the Han Dynasty, Dong Zhongshu believed that humans are copies of heaven, that heaven and humans can sense each other, and can warn the king of his misconduct and mismanagement with &quot;disasters&quot;; by the Song and Ming dynasties, heaven mainly became the heaven of justice, tending to one an inner transcendence and infinity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For heaven, most of the most outstanding kings and sages of the Chinese nation had a strong and heartfelt awe, and regarded the unity of heaven and man as their ultimate pursuit, thus giving integrity to daily life and political life. sense of meaning, certainty and direction. Mencius has a very vivid description of this realm of belief that is both ordinary and holy: what is desirable is called good, what is called self-belief is called faith, what is full is called beauty, what is full and glorious is called great, what is great is called transformation. Holy, what is holy but unknowable is called God. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Father&#39;s kindness and son&#39;s filial piety originate from the &quot;nature of destiny&quot; and from &quot;the child is free from the arms of his parents for three years&quot;. If this kind of human nature is brought into full play like Shun in &quot;Yao Canon&quot;, we can A saint who acquires a set of abilities including avoiding disasters, harmonizing the family, and governing the country is a saint who unites nature and man;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Emperor&quot; regards himself as the eldest son of Heaven to gain legitimacy and even sanctity, and must serve Heaven To carry on, we must nourish all people, and the world is for the common good;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ordinary people don’t understand this enough, and they don’t have the time to cultivate themselves. They need a constant income to have perseverance. This is normal, but it has a family “kissing” mechanism. With nourishment, there is still benevolence and righteousness in the heart. As long as you don&#39;t cut it off, you can also see the virtuous and considerate people; The obsession with external objects returns to the state of life where meaning flows. March is not contrary to benevolence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is extremely difficult to truly practice faith. For ordinary people, if they have permanent property and perseverance, maintain a comfortable life and common sense rooted in the meaning of family, they can become qualified members of the Chinese community; for people in high positions, if they cannot &quot;devour their heart and soul to understand heaven, &quot;If you cultivate your mind and cultivate your nature to serve Heaven&quot;, you will begin to pollute a large area from the source of law, politics, culture and education, and spread evil to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While Mencius affirmed that all people have the four ideals, he also clearly realized that &quot;human beings are somewhat different from beasts.&quot; He quoted from &quot;Shang Shu·Tai Oath&quot; that &quot;Heaven sees me and the people see me, and God listens to me and the people listen&quot;, and gave a principled explanation of the relationship between heaven and the people. God’s will is unpredictable and manifests itself through public opinion. A holy king who unites nature and man is rare to find in five hundred or even a thousand years, but secular kings who are holy because of their kings are everywhere. The reverence for heaven and the people is not empty talk, so it is necessary to establish a technical system to restrict the royal power, so that public opinion can be fully reflected, and governance can fully reflect public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public opinion may be divided and antagonistic, what should we do? Will it bring about the disadvantages of &quot;welfarism&quot;? Will the &quot;public opinion&quot; of this generation harm the &quot;public opinion&quot; of future generations? These challenges have entered the field of building a modern republic and legal system. In addition to drawing on the more mature modern governance system, we also need to give full play to the spirit of &quot;Spring of the First Year, King Zhengyue&quot; in &quot;Spring and Autumn&quot;. In the era of great changes, we should constantly return to the origin of politics and beliefs, consider profits and losses, and &quot;make&quot; new systems. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Literature and education: Respecting teachers, respecting morality, and vigorous spirit&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Liangzhu, Hongshan, Yangshao to Longshan, from Xia, Shang and Zhou to Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Ming and Qing, the Chinese community gradually formed and split frequently And it can be continuously unified, and the culture whose roots were formed over five thousand years will never be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have a unified square character that has basically not changed since ancient times. Even though &quot;the winds are different in hundreds of miles, and the customs are different in thousands of miles&quot;, a county may have several dialects, but we can still recognize and identify with each other. There is also the ideological system from Zhou Confucius, Mencius, Xun, Lao and Zhuang. They have governed themselves and made history, and they have also learned from history and classics, providing rich resources for spiritual inspiration and institutional reconstruction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are no insurmountable rivers or mountains in the land of China. Whether it is divided into feudal states or prefectures and counties, the gradually formed Zhou Wen and Han systems, Tang style and Song style are diverse but capable of unification, and have strong agglomeration effect. For thousands of years, no matter what force entered China, it would be transformed by Chinese culture to a large extent. They inherited Chinese culture and therefore gained basic recognition from the scholars in this tradition. This is the attraction and centripetal force of the Chinese national spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this cultural spirit faces not only the debate between China and the West, but also the changes in ancient and modern times. How to inherit and update our cultural spirit has been a major issue that several generations of intellectuals in modern times have struggled with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the Han Dynasty to the Tang and Song Dynasties, we spent thousands of years absorbing Buddhist culture, which not only gave birth to Chinese Zen Buddhism, but also gave birth to Taoism in the Song and Ming Dynasties.自晚清民初以来，面对强势的西学西政，两岸三地的学者大量翻译，极速消化，在政治上实践，在学术上对比吸纳，让中华文化初步开出了新的局面。这个过程远未结束。返本开新，需要一个自由而强大的，代表着中华民族精神第五维的文教系统。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;师者，所以传道授业解惑也。中国本来就治学的传统。两千四百年前即已大盛的稷下学宫，尽管是齐国官办，却也曾是中华大地上的国际学术中心。道、儒、法、名、兵、农、阴阳各家，孟子、荀子、申不害、鲁仲连、慎到等名重一时乃至影响千载的学者，在此“不治而议论”，“不任职而论国事”，由此而来的思想力量，携源头活水奔涌向前，影响至今。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自孔子打破“学在官府”而私人讲学，至汉代“精舍”，由唐时个人读书讲学之地的“书院”，发展到南宋，有张栻主讲的岳麓书院，朱熹修复的白鹿洞书院……民间书院制度大备，独立的分科教学体系、学生参与管理的自治方式，相对独立的经费来源，终于形成成熟的私学体系。至明代，自王阳明创办或主持，阐扬心学宗旨的龙冈、贵阳、会稽等书院，一变而至批判心学流弊而倡实学的东林书院，从未断绝。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些书院，有求道不求仕的风骨，有自由辩难的学风，有友以辅仁的气场，有“风声雨声读书声、家事国事天下事”的入世情怀。黄宗羲在《明夷待访录》里，更是提出了“天子之所是未必是，天子之所非未必非，天子亦遂不敢自为非是，而公其是非于学校”的观点，将是非与真理，提升至比天子更高的地位，恢复了以道论政的传统精义，振聋发聩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现代的知识分子需要传承士的精神，既要阐释和延续伟大的中华古代文明，也要因时而“作”，探索新的哲学之理、制度之理与科学之理。要言之，这个文教系统的根本，是对“师”和“士”的制度化、法治化的保障。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;结语&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;最后总结一句话：本文认为，天（天人合一的信仰系统）、地（民有恒产的经济制度）、国（天下为公的政治体系）、亲（亲亲为大，家庭结构中孕育的人格养成系统）、师（充满活力的研究、传道与文明对话的文教系统），以上五条，构成了中华文明的主要内容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p>;种种迹象表明，那次著名的永别，应该就在中易水之滨。那个名叫荆轲的男子，当他在高渐离的筑声中慷慨歌罢，众人目眦欲裂、怒发冲冠时，他已跳上马车，前往两千里外的秦都咸阳。为了报答太子丹的知遇之恩，他要去执行一项几乎不可能完成的任务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;依照当时交通条件，可供他选择的道路有两条，一条是南下，沿着大平原行至今天的河南开封，再折而向西；另一条是溯易水，穿过太行山八条隐秘孔道中的蒲阴陉和飞狐陉进入今天的山西，而后西南行，从蒲津渡过黄河，进入关中。无端地，我觉得荆轲多半会选择后者。虽然后者行路更为艰苦，但里程要短一些。尤为重要的是，也许，只有从平坦的平原，缓缓登上巍峨的大山——其时，同样有风，拂起荆轲的白袍——他矗立山口，再回头最后望一眼夕光下悲风四起的家园，更符合荆轲的人设。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当荆轲登场时，燕国的生命已进入倒计时。而卫国人荆轲，无疑是燕国历史大戏的华彩段落。八百年燕国史，就以荆轲刺秦的倔强和绝望，画上了一个苍凉悲壮的句号。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕国的历史，得从易水以北三百里说起。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那同样是一条河，一条比易水还要浅还要瘦的河：琉璃河。琉璃河属于海河流域一条微不足道的支流，当它流到北京房山区时，一座被琉璃河环抱的小镇便以琉璃河为名。小镇东边，自20世纪40年代以来，陆续发掘了一批商周文物和遗址。而今，以遗址为依托，建成了西周燕都遗址博物馆。博物馆的一面墙上有八个大字：鼎天鬲地，受命北疆。这八个字，说明了当年建立燕国，乃是为了保证周朝北疆安全。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;燕国疆域，大致相当于今天的河北北部一部分加北京地区。所有诸侯中，燕国地处最北，与它接壤的是称为戎的民族部落。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕国最初的都城——为叙述方便，姑且称为燕初都——就在博物馆附近。当然，两千多年前一个封国的都城，也就是一个大一些的集镇而已。燕国初立时，与它毗邻的是另一个更小的小国：蓟。不久，燕国兼并蓟国，将首都迁往蓟。蓟的地望，在今天的北京城区广安门一带。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/U9CatV5KXO1N1LSRngz9uAyuINPajP8hVdy0UiOT.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/U9CatV5KXO1N1LSRngz9uAyuINPajP8hVdy0UiOT.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;燕国存续八百余年间，前七百多年可以说没多少存在感。或者说，仅有的一次存在感，是这个北陲小国遇到了大麻烦——山戎入侵，几近亡国。幸好，中原地区正值春秋五霸之首齐桓公时代，在尊王攘夷旗帜下，齐桓公联络诸侯，组成联军，亲自率兵深入山戎腹地，与山戎打了好几仗，直到山戎远循。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从那以后，燕国又如同平凡的路人甲路人乙，默默无闻地在北国生息繁衍。等到诸侯再次把关注的目光投向它时，已是三百年之后了。这时，燕国发生了一桩令诸侯惊愕的大事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总体说来，春秋与战国的区别，重要的一点在于，春秋虽也战争频繁，但一般只把对手打到服输认错为止，而战国却以侵占对方领土甚至吞并对方为目的。血腥的战国时代，烽烟四起，干戈不息，古老的国家接二连三地灭亡，偏居一隅的燕国也感受到了极大的生存压力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前321年，燕国第一位称王的国君燕易王去世，其子姬哙即位，史称燕王哙。面对列强环伺而燕国弱小，燕王哙忧心如焚，他想励精图治，使落后的燕国立于不败之地。他真诚地认为，只要能使燕国强大，哪怕不由自己和自己的家族执政也在所不惜——种种迹象表明，燕王哙是一个朴实坦荡的人，惟其如此，他的梦想才会被别有用心的奸臣利用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奸臣即子之，时任燕国相国，深受燕王哙器重。子之确有几分才干，以致燕王哙错误地认为，燕国要振兴，必须依靠他。子之充分掌握了燕王哙急于求治的心理，他的两个心腹苏代和鹿毛寿经常向燕王哙进言，一面称许子之的治国能力，一面劝燕王哙效法尧舜，将天下禅让给子之。这样，子之既能将燕国治理好，实现燕国崛起，同时，燕王哙也将成为尧舜一样的圣人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对这些忽悠，燕王哙深以为然，“因举国属子之，子之大重”——燕王哙把国家大事都交给子之，由是，子之的权力炙手可热——当然，也更想坐上王位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不久，在子之及同党持续蛊惑下，燕王哙“收印自三百石吏而效之子之”，也就是把全国三百石以上中高级官员的印信全交给子之，由子之掌控。于是，“子之南面而行王事”。燕国王位由燕王哙转手子之，子之成了燕王，燕王哙反成了臣子，他以年老为由，不再过问政事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;儒家一直美化三代，认为尧、舜、禹的禅让乃是天下大同的象征。以后，还发生过汉献帝禅位曹丕，晋恭帝禅位刘裕，隋恭帝禅位李渊，唐哀帝禅位朱温，周恭帝禅位赵匡胤等多次禅让事件。不过，这些外姓之间的禅让都是受禅者以武力作后盾，君主不得不禅让。与之相比，真正发自内心的主动禅让，几千年历史上，燕王哙即便不是空前，也是绝后。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，燕王哙圣人般的禅让，带给燕国的，却是一场浩劫。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;子之在位三年，燕国没有像燕王哙希望的那样振兴，反而更糟，“燕国大乱，百姓恫怨”。燕王哙的儿子太子平，原本应该他继承王位，但父亲的禅让，却让他成了臣子，他当然想夺回本属于他的王位。于是，在将军市被支持下，太子平及其拥护者密谋推翻子之。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与燕国毗邻的齐国看到了染指燕国的绝佳时机。齐宣王派使者与太子平联络，表示愿意帮助太子平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有了齐国承诺，太子平自感大事将成，遂与市被攻打王宫。但是，齐国并没有按承诺及时出兵。太子平及市被战败身死，燕国一片混乱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;趁此良机，齐宣王发兵攻燕。燕军人心涣散，纷纷逃跑，燕王哙和子之均被齐军杀死。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;齐军侵燕，燕国损失惨重，大量重器被运走，宗庙被焚毁，死于非命的燕人达数万之多。齐军对燕人屠杀的直接证据，事发两千多年后重见天日：1966年，在河北易县燕下都发现了战国人头骨丛葬墓十四座，考古工作者对其中的5号墓作了抢救发掘。黄土下，大量白花花的人头骨被随意掩埋在一起，没有任何陪葬品。发掘报告说，“这批人骨几乎全是男性成丁个体”；“头骨中最多的属于18—35岁的青壮年，约占观察数的80%”；并且，考古工作者还发现，其中一些头骨要么被砍去一部分，要么还残留着箭头。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵国与燕国毗邻，在赵武灵王帮助下，燕王哙的另一个儿子公子职被护送回国继承王位，这就是燕昭王。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕昭王接手的是一个烂摊子，蓟被齐军洗劫破坏，无法再做都城。于是，他在更南方的易水河畔兴建了一座新城，这就是燕下都；相应的，蓟就是燕上都。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕初都遗址地处北京郊区，一条铁路紧贴着遗址，偶有火车驶过，发出惊天动地的声响，稍远处，是人烟稠密的琉璃河镇。至于燕上都遗址，则处于车水马龙的繁华大都市，车来车往，昼夜喧嚣。与燕初都和燕上都形成鲜明对比的是燕下都——在已经发掘的春秋战国诸侯都城里，燕下都是占地面积最大的一座，极盛时，估计约有三十万人口——而整个燕国的人口，大概率不超过三百万。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;玉米地尽头，黑杨挺拔，掩映着一条小河，小河流向易水。那一年，白衣飘飘，衣冠似雪，太子丹和一群燕人簇拥着荆轲，坐上马车，缓缓驶出燕下都，来到了城外不远的易水河畔。那里，有一座亭子；亭里，酒菜已经摆好。他们，即将最后一次共同举杯……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/vj9FASfXSnIgbCDNOWacLiNo7rW2ju9r8w2zdQ2l.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;燕昭王意识到了人才的重要性，只有吸纳最优秀的人才为燕国服务，燕国才可能在短时间内富国强兵。燕昭王求贤若渴的消息迅速传遍天下，不少身怀利器的士人纷纷前往燕国。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;寻访燕下都遗址前，我先去了河南洛阳。洛阳郊外公路一侧的田野里，有一座气度不凡的坟墓。墓侧，是河南省重点文物保护碑：苏秦墓。墓首广场上，立着几块高大的石碑，其中一块碑文为《战国合纵家苏秦墓碑记》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;投奔燕国的士人中，最知名、影响也最大的就是周天子直属的洛邑人苏秦。苏秦的事迹，主要记载于《史记》和《战国策》，但两书自相矛盾的地方非常多。这是因为，无论司马迁还是刘向，都苦于缺少真实可靠的一手材料。直到1973年底，长沙马王堆三号汉墓出土了一批帛书，苏秦的真实面目才渐渐清晰。这批帛书被专家整理为《战国纵横家书》。二十七章中，有十六章是司马迁和刘向未曾见过的久已失传的佚书。佚书的内容，正好与苏秦有关——于是，两千多年后，通过这些文字，我们终于得以还原一个以生命作代价的潜伏者：间谍苏秦。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;投奔燕昭王前，苏秦周游列国，寻找机会，但他磨破嘴皮，花光盘缠，却没有任何一个君主重视他。他回到家里，家人也对他爱理不理。因此，当燕昭王尊重他、礼遇他，把他视作国士时，苏秦决意士为知己者死。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;苏秦认为，七国中，燕最弱。秦、齐是强国，赵是次强国。燕国无法与它们任何一国抗衡。要想打败齐国复仇，必须削弱齐国，而削弱齐国的最好途径，就是怂勇、支持齐国去吞并宋国，这样齐国势必成为众矢之的。为了让齐国执行错误路线并达到削弱它的目的，苏秦愿意前往齐国作内应。他与燕昭王约定：“内寇不与，外敌不可距。王自治其外，臣自报其内，此乃亡之之势也。”——内乱不生，外边不能轻易行动。大王在外策划对付齐国，我打入齐国制造混乱。这样，灭亡齐国的形势就造成了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;苏秦以燕国使者的身份来到齐国，及后，他以卓越的才华和口才，赢得了齐湣王的信任，被任命为相国——其地位，甚至超过了在燕国。随着苏秦受到齐湣王重用，燕昭王的身边人开始怀疑，苏秦或许不会信守曾经的承诺，燕昭王一度也动摇了。为此，苏秦写信告诉燕昭王，发誓他将“信如尾生、廉如伯夷、孝如曾参”——这些当时属于绝密的通信，正是通过汉初帛书的传抄，在两千多年后重见天日。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在齐国十余年间，尽管国际局势不断变化，苏秦始终如一地执行他与燕昭王的约定，即在为齐国制定对外政策时，总是想方设法削弱齐国。其间，他既曾劝阻了秦王约齐王共同称帝，还成功地离间了秦、齐关系，组成五国联军伐秦，并使赵、楚等国均与齐国关系紧张。尤其重要的是，他促使齐王三次入侵并最后吞并了宋国。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了麻痹齐国君臣，对齐国恨之入骨的燕昭王唯齐王马首是瞻。齐国伐宋时，燕国派兵相助。甚至，齐湣王因小事处死了燕军将领，燕昭王虽悲愤下泪，却又派使者向齐湣王承认错误……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前286年，齐灭宋。位于中原膏腴之地的宋国，系周初分封殷商遗民而建，级别很高：公爵。这个高贵而富庶的国家被齐国吞并，引发了其他诸侯强烈不满。此时，燕国在燕昭王呕心沥血治理下，已然兵强马壮。此消彼长，齐国早已外强中干。于是，一年多后，燕昭王倾全国之兵，由大将乐毅率领，潮水般地越过齐燕边境，杀入齐国。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当燕军进攻齐国，苏秦名为齐国相国，实为燕国间谍的身份暴露了，他被狂怒的齐湣王处以车裂的酷刑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;齐王的狂怒却无法抵挡志在复仇的燕军，燕军攻破齐都临淄，齐湣王逃跑，后来被楚军将领淖齿所杀——他的死非常悲惨：“射王股，擢王筋，悬之于庙梁，宿昔而死。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕军连下齐国七十余城，仅余下即墨和莒还在困兽犹斗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，即墨之围期间，燕昭王去世了。时局，也一下子发生了峰回路转的巨变：即位的燕惠王做太子时就与乐毅有隙，在齐国挑拨下，他将乐毅撤职，乐毅只好投奔赵国——春秋战国时代，这种用脚投票的行为屡见不鲜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原本处于绝对弱势的齐国，在名将田单的运筹帷幄下咸鱼翻生——燕军被赶出国境，齐国失去的城池一一收复。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕国昙花一现的强盛也就到此为止，它像一颗划过天空的流星，当人们还在仰望它并惊讶于它的灿烂时，它已熄灭并坠落。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;后来&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;有意思的是，享国八百余年的燕国，它最精彩的两大历史事件，即苏秦间齐和荆轲刺秦，其主角都是外国人；而不论是作为间谍还是作为刺客，以这种非同寻常的手段试图打败一个国家或是拯救一个国家，都充满了天马行空的想象力和步步惊心的传奇色彩。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从辈分上说，太子丹是燕昭王六世孙，两人之间相距五十多年。从燕昭王去世到太子丹的父亲燕王喜在位的半个世纪里，燕国国运每况愈下，四代燕王昏招叠出，九次对外战争，仅小胜一次。其中，燕王喜在位时，赵国在长平之战中惨败，作为赵国邻居，燕国不仅没有唇亡齿寒，反而趁火打劫，却被惨败之余的赵国暴击，以致燕都被困，不得不纳重金求和。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鹬蚌相争，渔翁得利。奋六世之余烈而进行统一战争的秦国乃是诸侯火拼的最终受益者。秦灭韩后，再灭赵，秦国势力进抵南易水。此前，燕国已沿着南易水修筑了长城。然而，太子丹知道，简陋的长城，根本无法抵挡秦国的虎狼之师。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他希望有一个办法，能够快速且一劳永逸地解除秦国威胁，拯救风雨飘摇的燕国。于是，便有了众所周知的荆轲刺秦；便有了两千多年前，易水河边那场风萧萧兮的饯别宴……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/J2zZt3V7ZcZwjVHayueRKgRLKKn6oXdk4WNJIC8L.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;从远处看，荆轲塔的形状像一柄短剑，直刺蓝得空洞的苍穹。它让我想起了荆轲藏在地图中的匕首。图穷匕现，如果那把淬过剧毒的匕首刺死了嬴政；又或者，燕昭王的寿命再延续十年；历史，一定不是我们后来看到的那样。只是，世界上有苹果有芒果有开心果，却没有如果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/OeWlz0cgwTsfzJQ2BWrovDOIpEAWW1gcEapnM3C4.jpeg&quot;

Twelve years ago, the 23-year-old Su Bingtian also stood on the second track of the men&#39;s 100-meter final of the Shenzhen Universiade. That time, he won the bronze medal. The media called him &quot;China&#39;s sprint hope.&quot; Later, Su Bingtian became famous all the way on the 100-meter track, collecting many records to his name, carving a place in the world of track and field, and becoming the undisputed leader of Chinese sprints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 23-year-old Chen Guanfeng almost replicated Su Bingtian’s medal-winning journey. This is the first time in his career that he has appeared in a real world competition, and it is also the first time that he has set foot in a world-class men’s competition. The track for the 100-meter final. He ran a personal season-best time of 10.16 seconds in the semifinals, and two hours later in the final, he crossed the finish line third in 10.17 seconds. After the game, Chen Guanfeng, draped in the national flag, ran around the track and field to express his gratitude to the audience.

Chen Guanfeng is 1.80 meters tall, 8 centimeters taller than Su Bingtian. In 2020, his time in the 100-meter event was about 10.40 seconds, and his personal best in 2021 was 10.19 seconds. In the National Championships of the same year, Chen Guanfeng won the championship in 10.06 seconds against two famous players of the national team, Wu Zhiqiang and Xu Zhouzheng, in nearly zero wind speed. He was only 0.01 seconds away from the Olympic standard. He surpassed Ho Yuhong&#39;s 10.19 seconds in one fell swoop and became China&#39;s &quot;post-2000&quot; 100-meter sprinter. one person. He also became the fourth-best player in the history of the Chinese team after Su Bingtian, Xie Zhenye and Zhang Peimeng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Guanfeng said: &quot;I will try my best to attack the Olympic podium. Although I don&#39;t know whether I can succeed, I will also help the young people behind me like Su Bingtian. , set a good example for them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Chen Guanfeng is still a fresh face in the national track and field competition, he has long been known as the &quot;Xiguan Flying Man&quot; in Guangzhou. Before the age of 17, Chen Guanfeng had been a campus player and did not enter a sports school to receive systematic professional training. He has represented Guangzhou No. 1 Middle School in inter-school competitions many times, and his running speed is much faster than that of ordinary students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have always been active since I was a child and like to run and jump. I seem to have always had better sports scores in elementary school, so the physical education teachers recommended me to practice in the school track and field team. I did not sacrifice a lot of study time to practice track and field. Like other students, they also have to do homework and take exams,&quot; Chen Guanfeng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He ranked first in competitions in Liwan District many times and was discovered by Gu Yanqiang, the former coach of the West Village Youth Amateur Sports School. In 2015, Gu Yanqiang took up his new position at Guangzhou Sports Vocational and Technical College. He did long-term ideological work with Chen Guanfeng&#39;s parents and himself, and recruited Chen Guanfeng into the school after the high school entrance examination. &quot;My parents are very supportive of me and have always told me that doing what you like to do and being happy is the most important thing.&quot; Chen Guanfeng recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Yanqiang commented on him: &quot;It was a bit late to receive professional training, but he is talented in sprinting, has a good figure and good jumping ability. He is a rare talent.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/01/yJAMO94NiPbDa8jm3UteqAMOOKu73TlP0Hi54Vhd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;674&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/01/yJAMO94NiPbDa8jm3UteqAMOOKu73TlP0Hi54Vhd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252915&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On August 2, 2023, in the men&#39;s 100-meter final of the track and field event at the 31st Summer Universiade in Chengdu, China&#39;s Chen Guanfeng won the third place with a time of 10.17 seconds&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first entered the sports school, Chen Guanfeng’s foundation was relatively weak, and his best 100-meter time was 11.03 seconds. As he grows older and his coach slowly guides him, Chen Guanfeng&#39;s training gradually gets on the right track. In Gu Yanqiang&#39;s plan, he will spend two years laying the foundation, training explosive power, coordination, balance, and sensitivity, and gradually improving strength and frequency. At the end of 2017, Chen Guanfeng joined the Guangdong Provincial Team. In 2018, he became a regular from the provincial team and was selected for the Chinese national track and field team. He became the main member of the men&#39;s 4×100 meter relay event and began to launch an impact on larger competitions. He constantly refreshed his original speed and emerged in the track and field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, Chen Guanfeng joined Su Bingtian’s team for training. After Su Bingtian created the &quot;myth&quot; of 9.83 seconds in the Tokyo Olympics, the Su Bingtian Speed ​​Research and Training Center, jointly built by Jinan University, Guangdong Provincial Sports Bureau, and the Chinese Athletics Association, was established to explore cutting-edge technology, discipline construction and technology in track and field training. Innovation to support the cultivation and selection of track and field reserve talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The technical team filmed Chen Guanfeng’s daily training and analyzed his technical movements. He improved his starts and runs as a result. &quot;My advantage at the start was pretty good, but my running was very bad on the way. I often led in the first 60 to 70 meters, but overtook me in the last 20 to 30 meters.&quot; Chen Guanfeng analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reviewing his performance on the 100-meter track at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chen Guanfeng said that his performance in the first half of the race was normal, but after adjusting his technique, the old problem of serious slowdown in the second half still existed. He admitted that his legs were slightly uncomfortable during the second half of the final, so he chose a relatively conservative finishing strategy. After all, there were relay tasks ahead. &quot;I am still in the process of adapting and running in with new technologies, but I have achieved my goal of advancing to the finals. With my current hard power, I am not particularly outstanding in Asia, so the finals are a process of learning and enjoying.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Watching his senior Xie Zhenye break the 10-second mark in Hangzhou, Chen Guanfeng excitedly said that this is a historic moment for Chinese sprinting. Regarding the question about whether he has the chance to become the fourth Chinese athlete to break the 10-second barrier for 100 meters, Chen Guanfeng said that he will go all out and be ready to take over at all times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think there are too many talented people. You must train hard and maintain your best condition every day in order to not fall behind in the arena.&quot; Chen Jianfeng said, &quot;This is my first time. Participating in the Asian Games, with the current sprint level of Asian countries, I can&#39;t say that I will definitely get a ranking, but the goal I set for myself is to advance to the finals.&quot; Judging from his performance in this Asian Games, he achieved his goal. We have There are reasons to believe that this post-2000 athlete will bring us more surprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中小学流行“萝卜刀”惹争议：让孩子没有害人之心，比严防死守害人之物重要得多丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257942]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a children&#39;s toy has caused heated discussion in public opinion. According to media reports, almost all primary school students have a &quot;carrot knife&quot;, which is a colorful plastic imitation knife toy that uses its own gravity to slide the knife body. The &quot;Carrot Knife&quot; is available in different colors and sizes, with prices ranging from 5 yuan to 25 yuan. There are also different styles such as &quot;printed flash radish knife&quot; and &quot;luminous gravity radish knife&quot;, which have already sold &quot;400,000&quot; online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media reports said that some parents reported to the Chongqing Online Political Questioning Platform that primary and secondary school students brought &quot;carrot knives&quot; into school to play together, which posed safety risks. Some parents are worried that if their children imitate actions such as stabbing and poking, it will have a negative impact on their psychology. When interviewed, some experts and scholars said that the &quot;carrot knife&quot; has safety hazards and &quot;subconsciously inspires children to be violent and do the same thing with a real knife.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first glance, it seems that the carrot knife is a kind of &quot;knife&quot; just like its name, and there is a danger of cutting, scratching and stabbing children. If the carrot knife is really a sharp-edged tool that can easily hurt people, not to mention that minors should not possess it, it should also be classified as a controlled knife in the adult world. However, judging from the actual situation of this toy, I am afraid that its danger is not as serious as that reported by parents and experts. Words such as &quot;danger&quot;, &quot;warning&quot; and &quot;warning&quot; are also exaggerated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, judging from the appearance and material of the carrot knife, its &quot;edge&quot; is an obtuse angle and it is also a plastic product. How much harm it can do to humans can only be achieved by piercing white paper and apples with a few pieces. The photos are not convincing, and pencils and ballpoint pens can also be used to pierce them. Are they also banned because they are dangerous? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is the innate nature of human beings to play with objects in their hands. Even for common stationery such as rulers and ballpoint pens, children have developed recreational uses for turning pens and placing rulers. If we have to talk about the degree of danger, any of these commonly used stationery items, such as a 30-degree triangle, a thin steel ruler, and a sharp ballpoint pen tip, is probably much more dangerous than a carrot knife. Even long fingernails can scratch the skin. A book page can also cut your finger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, if it is just to prevent the possible harm caused by such &quot;blunt plastic knives&quot;, it is obvious that measures such as &quot;playing under parental supervision&quot; and &quot;not allowing children to bring it to school&quot; should be adopted. is to exaggerate the power of a plastic blunt knife toy and devote a disproportionate amount of attention to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the rhetoric of “stimulating children’s violent tendencies” when interviewed by experts and scholars is also worthy of analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the long years before the advent of the carrot knife, generations of minors would also imitate &quot;stabbing, poking, poking and other actions&quot; because this is something written in human genes. Human ancestors jumped from hunting activities to becoming the spiritual beings and then ruling the earth. It is the nature of every child to imitate and use weapons. A simple wooden sword or a delicate toy sword is almost everyone’s childhood memory. Who hasn&#39;t fantasized as a child about being a superhero, or more or less a general and a vigilante? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Playing is a way for children to understand the world. Role-playing and imitating martial arts movements are their irrepressible nature. Advertising slogans such as &quot;Show me my carrot knife and defeat the enemy with one strike&quot; In fact, there is no big problem. If children&#39;s behavior of imitating the use of weapons is denigrated as &quot;violent tendencies&quot;, this is definitely inconsistent with formal logic and goes against common sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference between small plastic toys and real sharp controlled knives, the difference between simulated games and wounding with a knife, and even the difference between legal violence and illegal violence, children with a little ability to discern After receiving education, they can be easily distinguished. The statement of &quot;stimulating violent tendencies&quot; goes too far, and it also denies children&#39;s cognitive and discerning abilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, from the perspective of healthy growth of minors, it is actually unrealistic to over-protect them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Minors will always encounter various risks in their growth process. This is not only the inevitable path of life, but also the price that cannot be avoided. Traffic rules cannot yet eliminate all traffic accidents, sports competitions cannot eliminate all injuries, and even adult society cannot eliminate all risks. On campus, stationery, tree branches, tables, chairs, and benches can all injure people. Should the campus be like a prison, free of sharp objects and hard walls, and tightly controlled? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, &quot;Don&#39;t underestimate children&quot; has long been a consensus in education. Neither parents nor schools should over-protect minors or completely deny their ability to self-manage. Minors will grow up one day, and it is impossible to keep them strictly guarded in a sterile environment and worry about every possible safety risk. The correct approach should be to guide them to correctly assess risks and teach them the ability to fight risks independently. Otherwise, there would not be such a famous saying in the Chinese world as “civilized in spirit, barbaric in body.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, in the face of the popularity of &quot;Carrot Knife&quot; toys, the right thing for adults to do is to provide reasonable guidance and teach children correct values. It is much more important to prevent children from harming others than to strictly guard against harmful things. After all, if you have an evil intention, you can harm others and yourself with your bare hands; if you have the right views and knowledge, you can use sharp weapons to defend yourself and protect others. Not only does a small dull plastic knife pose no safety risks, it can actually become an &quot;experience package&quot; for children to view violence correctly and learn to face risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[不在景区“人挤人”，批发市场成假期新选宝地？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257768]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 16:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[车臣的王，可能快不行了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257966]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/Fepy81wVavQ3ougQ4gFwpSQzxZc5lolwHTrulIGm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/Fepy81wVavQ3ougQ4gFwpSQzxZc5lolwHT rulIGm. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252396&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 15, 2023 local time, current Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Ramzan Kadyrow)&lt;/span>;&#39;s assistant released a video of Kadyrov walking with his family to refute Uzbekistan&#39;s previous statement that Kadyrov was &quot;seriously ill&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier that day, the &quot;Kyiv Independent&quot; quoted a spokesperson of the Security Service of Ukraine &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(SBU)&lt;/span>; Andrei Yusov said that Kadyrov was &quot;seriously ill&quot; and &quot;his illness has worsened, leading to such a serious condition.&quot; According to the report, the source pointed out that Kadyrov had &quot;fallen into a coma&quot; and &quot;is recovering. Waiting to be transferred from Chechnya to &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(possibly the United Arab Emirates)&lt;/span>; for treatment.&quot; Yusof also told the media, &quot;He &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Kadyrov)&lt;/span>; has been ill for a long time and has systemic health problems. His condition has been very poor in recent days. Serious.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Kadyrov is smiling broadly in the video, it can be clearly seen that his facial contour and figure have changed significantly, and he seems to be far fatter than before. Some outsiders have speculated This is the swelling caused by his long-term kidney disease. In short, despite his own personal experience, there is still a lot of speculation and controversy about his health issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kadyrov&#39;s health condition aroused doubts from the outside world in early 2023 - Kadyrov, who claims to be infinitely loyal to Putin and will hardly miss any major events of the Moscow authorities, suddenly disappeared without any notice. Putin was absent from Putin&#39;s annual State of the Union address. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Father&#39;s legacy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ramzan Kadyrov, the current president of the Chechen Republic, likes to call himself &quot;Putin&#39;s little soldier&quot; and is Putin&#39;s most loyal ally. People call him Putin&#39;s fighting dog. In addition to the administrative regions, the Russian Federation also has 24 autonomous republics &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (including the internationally unrecognized territory of Ukraine)&lt;/span>;, Kaiti It is the most special one among the 24 heads of autonomous republics at the same level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes him special is not just his relationship with President Putin, but also that he is a social media influencer. Kadyrov said that while he admired Putin, he also tried to create the same tough guy image as Putin. Therefore, he posted videos and photos of himself firing machine guns and taming tigers on social media, as well as his high-end and luxurious daily life. Kadyrov is not only eye-catching, he is also a person who cannot be criticized casually in the Russian Federation - the leaders of the other 23 autonomous republics obviously do not have this treatment. Any Russian media or individual criticizes him in public, even if he is not there In Chechnya, people will also be asked to be cautious in their words and deeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This unique status comes from his father Akhmad Kadyrov &lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ahmed Kadyrov, the former President of the Republic of Chechnya, his presidential term ended in seven months - he was killed by a bomb in an assassination attempt in May 2004 at the age of 52 years old. Ahmed was the central figure in the Kadyrov family&#39;s rise to become the rulers of the Chechen Republic, and his life was full of ups and downs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ahmed was born into a poor family in Karaganda, Kazakhstan in 1951. At that time, all the Chechens were transferred from Chechnya to Central Asia by the Soviet government to break up their resistance. They are the descendants of this group of immigrants. Later, with the change of the Soviet policy towards Chechnya, the Chechens were able to return to their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ahmed worked in agriculture and construction during the Soviet era. In the 1980s, he entered the Islamic University of Uzbekistan to study religious studies, and then established the first modern Islamic religious schools in Chechnya, and later more He went to Oman and Jordan for further studies and became a famous religious scholar in Chechnya. In 1993, Dudayev, the leader of the Chechen separatists, declared the independence of Chechnya. Ahmed was a religious leader whom Dudayev relied heavily on. At that time, he also issued a famous declaration of jihad against Russia:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are 1 million Chechens and 150 million Russians. If each Chechen kills 150 Russians, we will win.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the Chechen war broke out, and Ahmed not only called for war against Russia He launched a jihad and personally led a guerrilla force during the war. His youngest son, the current Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, also joined the guerrillas. He later claimed that he had successfully killed someone at the age of 19. One Russian soldier died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Russian army in the First Chechen War ended in failure and suffered heavy casualties, and was forced to make a humiliating retreat. After the war, Ahmed Kadyrov, who had become the chief mufti of Chechnya One of the main representatives of the negotiations with Russia, his guerrillas were also known as the Kadyrov faction due to their outstanding military exploits during the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is strange, however, is that Ahmed broke with the Chechen independence faction in 1999. In the same year, Putin became the president of Russia, and the second Chechen War broke out. Ahmed this time withdrew his last declaration of jihad and led his troops in an alliance with the Russian government to fight the Chechen separatists he had fought alongside. With his help, the Russian army won the second Chechen War, which became Putin&#39;s first military victory after coming to power. This success avenged its shame, and the popularity of the Putin government was unprecedentedly high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why Ahmed defected to help Russia in the second Chechen War, the outside world generally believes that in addition to personal ambitions and desires, he also had to do with the rise of Wahhabi fundamentalists in Chechnya. Worry. As the supreme religious leader of Chechnya, he is quite resistant to the international jihad claimed by the Wahhabis. From an ideological perspective, he is still a Chechen nationalist. After experiencing the first Chechen war, Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, was not only reduced to ruins, but also suffered a large number of casualties among the local population, causing serious social problems and economic crisis. At this time, the fundamentalists among the Chechen independence faction chose to ally with bin Laden and his like during the rise of global terrorism in an attempt to expand their territory in Russia. This is obviously not something that the Chechen nation with a population of 1.5 million can accomplish. matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on national sentiments and personal safety considerations, Ahmed publicly accused extremists of using Chechnya as a base for terrorist attacks in early 1999, which was dangerous and full of conspiracies. This led him and previous The relationship between comrades quickly deteriorated to the point of tension. At this time, the Russian government extended an olive branch to him, and forming an alliance became a matter of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reciprocating the favor, after the second Chechen War, Putin gave Ahmed the throne of Chechen president until his death in an assassination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is difficult to determine whether it was Ahmed&#39;s defection to Moscow that prompted Putin to make up his mind to launch a second Chechen war, or whether Putin wanted to establish his prestige through a war after coming to power, or whether the two complemented each other. result. But looking at Ahmed&#39;s choice now, whether it is based on his personal interests or the interests of the Chechen nation, it is not a mistake. Even if he did not defect and the second Chechen War did not break out at the end of 1999, after the &quot;9·11&quot; incident in 2001, it would be difficult for Chechnya to survive independently under the banner of joint anti-terrorism between the United States and Russia. It may even cause a more serious humanitarian disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Prince&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As Putin’s biggest contributor in the Second Chechen War, Ahmed Kadyrov’s political legacy was successfully passed on to his younger son Ramzan Kadyrov. Derov succeeded, and the latter soon became the real &quot;king&quot; of Chechnya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a process for getting to the top. In November 2005, a year and a half after Ahmed was assassinated, the then Prime Minister of Chechnya Sergey Abramov was seriously injured in a car accident and resigned due to health reasons. The cause of his car accident has not yet been determined, and the possibility of assassination cannot be completely ruled out, because at that time, assassinations of Chechen military and political leaders were common, and Sergei was assassinated in 2004, so the truth may never be confirmed. In any case, the biggest beneficiary of this car accident was the then First Deputy Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov. He became acting Prime Minister of Chechnya on November 18, 2005. A year later, he was officially promoted from &quot;Prince&quot; as &quot;King&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ZvIZ8puCKbgy4aB6jOT5UdVh8YhdujEScHCwozQc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;746&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ZvIZ8puCKbgy4aB6jOT5UdVh8YhdujEScHCwozQc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252398&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 30, 2004, President of the Chechen Republic Akhmed Kadyrov (right) and his son Ramzan Kadyrov&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan Kadyrov’s first task after taking power was to rebuild Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. He built the Akhmed Kadyrov Mosque in the center of Chechnya in the name of his father, also known as the Heart of Chechnya. It is the largest mosque in Russia and one of the largest in Europe; it has the most It can accommodate 10,000 people, has a magnificent dome, a towering minaret and hand-painted by Turkish craftsmen. These are the standards for large mosques built during the heyday of the Ottoman Empire. On October 16, 2008, the mosque was officially opened. Ramzan Kadyrov and Putin both attended the opening ceremony and appeared side by side in the news. In addition to the magnificent mosque, the palace-like presidential palace, highways, five-star hotels and casinos have risen from the ground. Now Grozny has become a modern city with many high-rise buildings. Its core business district is even compared with Moscow and St. Petersburg. No less impressive. Funding for these large-scale infrastructure projects comes from the support of the Russian Federation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to reward the loyalty of the Kadyrov family, under the personal care of President Putin, the Russian Federation invested US$18 billion in the Chechen Republic in 2010 alone, with an average per capita income of more than US$1,300. In contrast, the autonomous republic of Dagestan next door to Chechnya spent less than $1.6 billion in federal investment in 2010, but the country has a population of 2.2 million. Relying on financial support from Moscow, Ramzan was able to complete the reconstruction of Grozny as one of the core achievements of his internal rule. However, the heavy economic dependence on Russia has also led to a rather deformed economic structure in Chechnya. The local area lacks core industrial chains and the unemployment rate remains high. In 2010, it even reached an astonishing over 60%. It is obviously impossible to solve the problem by relying entirely on federal funds and large-scale construction projects. The core local issue is the economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/alxQC5TrmUCcwFQIdOagoa4PBKvPULr8v5AI7jxx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/alxQC5TrmUCcwFQIdOagoa4PBKvPULr8v5AI7jxx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252397&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 25, 2022, the Chechen armed forces held a swearing-in meeting to prepare for their mission in Ukraine. Chechen leader Kadyrov (middle) takes a group photo with soldiers &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What we must note is that La Mzan&#39;s greatest economic achievement in Chechnya is not that he built Grozny into another St. Petersburg through extensive construction, but that he successfully obtained economic autonomy from Moscow. In 2018, Ramzan Kadyrov announced that his government would take over 100% of the shares of Chechen State Petroleum Technology Company, allowing Chechens to develop, extract and sell crude oil on their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, 1,100 oil wells and 2,000 land parcels owned by the Chechen State Petroleum Technology Company with a total area of ​​7,740 hectares were all controlled by the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Ramzan has been fighting for control of oil assets in Chechnya since at least 2015, the year he first proposed to Putin that the Chechen Oil Company be handed over to Chechnya. On the surface, Putin agreed to transfer the equity, but in fact he has been putting it on hold. The reason why Moscow adopts the procrastination strategy is not entirely due to economic considerations, but one of the main means of control over Chechnya for a long time is economic control. During the Soviet era, Moscow firmly controlled the extraction, transportation and sales of local oil. Local people could only engage in agriculture and handicrafts, and were almost unable to enter the oil industry. The result of this was that the local area had to rely on financial subsidies from the Soviet Union&#39;s central government, otherwise infrastructure and public spending would be almost impossible to carry out. During the first Chechen war, Chechen guerrillas obtained military expenses by stealing crude oil from Russian oil pipelines passing through Chechnya. The elites in Moscow certainly know the importance of controlling the oil industry in controlling Chechnya. Therefore, they are not only unwilling to hand over control, but also deliberately do not expand local oil production capacity. However, Ramzan successfully overcame the calculations of the oil oligarchs and economic elites by relying on his personal relationship with Putin. With Putin&#39;s personal intervention, Ramzan got what he wanted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As seen in the fight for control of oil, Ramzan Kadyrov clearly knows what he needs and how to get it from Moscow. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kadyrov&#39;s Chechnya&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chechen high school students are now required to read Akhmed Kadyrov&#39;s biography &quot;The Road Bathed in Light&quot;, according to Chechen state television &quot;, as &quot;supplementary material for the study of Russian history&quot;, the book introduces &quot;the political and spiritual legacy of Akhmad Kadyrov&quot;. Schools are required to organize regular essay and poster competitions featuring Kadyrov and his family. Teachers and school administrators are required to comment on social media posts by Kadyrov and his inner circle as part of their job evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the magnificent Kadyrov Mosque, there are more than 300 streets in the Chechen Republic named after Akhmed Kadyrov. In 2020, Ramzan Kadyrov ordered that images of American comic book superheroes be removed from Chechen children&#39;s centers and playgrounds and replaced with likenesses of his father and other &quot;real heroes&quot; in the region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan hopes that his father will become the only superhero in Chechnya, and he will become the first Internet celebrity in Chechnya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Kadyrov family on the Internet shines brightly, and at the same time they are down-to-earth and full of true nature. Instagram has been Ramzan’s favorite platform for years, where he actively shares his outfits and lifestyle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan also opened a Telegram channel to share his carefully recorded videos and his views on the current situation. He even gained millions of followers by feuding with Elon Musk on Twitter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Run by his PR team, his father, Ahmed Kadyrov, became a loving father and hero who saved Chechnya and became a great martyr, revolutionary and Martyr Saint. Ramzan himself is a kind-hearted Chechen brother. Not only does he have an enviable luxurious and cool life, he is also a fan of President Putin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with Vesti-24 TV station in 2018, Ramzan Kadyrov stated that he was rebuilding Putin&#39;s Caucasus native cavalry division, or &quot;Barbarian Division&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very famous allusion to Tsarist Russia. The Caucasus Cavalry Division was affiliated to the Russian Imperial Army. It was established on August 23, 1914. It participated in World War I and was led by Russian Grand Duke Michael Alexander. Rovich conducts. The division earned the nickname &quot;The Barbarians&quot; for its lax discipline, but the unit was a fighting force, distinguished itself during World War I and was loyal to the Tsar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan&#39;s concept of &quot;barbarian divisions&quot; actually has a deeper meaning. Since Putin intends to incorporate Tsarist Russia into the orthodox national historical narrative, Ramzan&#39;s repeated mention of &quot;barbarian divisions&quot; is precisely to borrow from ancient times. Yu Jin showed his loyalty to Putin. In fact, Ramzan has been working hard to maintain an image of himself and the Chechen nation as brave and loyal. The security forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs controlled by Ramzan not only collaborated with the Russian army in South Ossetia&#39;s war against Georgia in 2008, but also actively participated in the Syrian war. Chechen special forces have frequently participated in various international special forces competitions, and have won the Jordan King&#39;s Cup special competitions many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lzvpOxPRgyNW9F2JGK2lIcNC5q2C7Zx2VReO5K60.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lzvpOxPRgyNW9F2JGK2lIcNC5q2C7Zx2VReO5K60.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252395&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 13, 2023, in Moscow, Russian President Putin (left) met with Chechen leader Kadyrov&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to participating in Russia-related military operations, the international community also accused Ramzan of participating in the assassination or intimidation of Russian anti-government figures, but there is not enough evidence to prove this. Prove this. Since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Chechnya has sent tens of thousands of troops to directly participate. Although there is no evidence to prove that they played a key role in the war, and they are not even as good as the Wagner mercenary group that successfully captured a city, their posture is undoubtedly very important. in place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What further illustrates Ramzan’s attitude is that when Prigozhin led Wagner to march into Moscow in June 2023, local troops along the way were unable to intercept him. Only Ramzan Kadyrov’s men were the last to stop him. The elite &quot;Akhmat&quot; special forces positioned themselves on a bridge near the town of Kolomna, about 110 kilometers from Moscow, preparing to intercept the Wagner rebels, saying they were ready to fight to defend Vladimir Putin. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Loyal enough, and Ramzan clearly does not look like a threat to Putin&#39;s regime. Not only because of the small number of ethnic Chechens, but more importantly, within Moscow’s power circle, Kadyrov’s only political backer is Putin. If Putin loses his support, there is no guarantee that the next Chechen president’s surname will still be Kadyrov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it seems that the probability that the future leader of Chechnya will be named Kadyrov is still very high, not to mention that members of the Kadyrov family almost control all important positions in the Chechen government. Like his son Akhmat Kadyrov who is less than 18 years old &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Akhmat Kadyrov)&lt;/span>; was also attacked in March 2023 received an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant reports, this was an informal meeting.

Putin congratulated Akhmat on his upcoming marriage and shared with Akhmat his memories of his relationship with his grandfather, Akhmat Kadyrov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one knows what they said, but they may have talked about Putin meeting a weeping Ramzan in the Kremlin after Ahmed was assassinated in 2004.

However, netizens in Shandong have posted When the tall man next to him came out, Heilongjiang netizens were not idle either. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that in the national height competition between boys and girls, the height of boys in Heilongjiang ranks first, while the height of girls ranks first in Shandong Province. With the development of economy and life As the level increases, the average heights of men and women are 174 cm and 161.4 cm respectively. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Height has always been a topic of public concern. What kind of height is best in the eyes of the opposite sex? According to Polish scientist Pokryka, the standard for a perfect woman is an average height of 1.74 meters, and the standard for a perfect man is an average height of no less than 1.82 meters, with leg length equal to the length of the upper body, and a ratio of 1:1 that makes a man Looks stronger. However, the so-called perfect body standard cannot be generalized. In the era of aesthetic diversity, health has a standard definition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what factors determine height? First of all, 70% of a person&#39;s final height depends on genetic factors, but in addition to genes, nutrition, exercise, environment, living habits, etc. all have a great impact on height. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this is only an ideal standard. In reality, there are still relatively few situations that can achieve this state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current aesthetic trend of society pursuing height, many people will have height anxiety and try unconventional remedies to increase their height through injections, medicines, and surgeries.
