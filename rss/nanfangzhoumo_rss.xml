The Republican Party is quite dissatisfied with Austin&#39;s &quot;political performance&quot; so far, and recently even publicly proposed to reduce his annual salary from US$220,000 to US$1. The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed amendments to the relevant bill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who proposed the amendment, said fiercely in the House of Representatives: &quot;Austin did not perform his job responsibilities. In fact, he is destroying our military.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is going on? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/52d93b7d33.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;809&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/52d93b7d33.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254841&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Republican Party is quite dissatisfied with Austin&#39;s &quot;political performance&quot; so far.

Austin pensions are estimated to be worth starting at $1.8 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if Austin cuts his salary to $1, the impact on him will be &quot;not too big.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Austin and Biden have known each other for many years and are deeply trusted by the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The outside world generally believes that Austin has &quot;AB side&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Side A, when Austin was still a colonel, he was appointed commander of the 82nd Airborne Division. Because of his outstanding performance, Austin has many &quot;firsts&quot; in his resume. For example, the first African American Secretary of Defense; the first African American Army Deputy Chief of Staff; the first African American Central Command Commander...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Austin’s military resume has a strong Middle Eastern flavor and he served as commander of the U.S. Central Command. Commanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and the fight against the extremist organization &quot;Islamic State&quot; were the highlight moments of Austin&#39;s career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Biden once wrote an article emphasizing that Austin not only has rich experience, skills and strategies as a soldier, but also has diplomatic abilities. Calling Austin a &quot;tested soldier and leader.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Biden does not regard the ability of the Secretary of Defense as the primary consideration.&quot; Yang Zhen, deputy director of the Northeast Asia Research Center of Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, believes that this often makes him &quot;Playing minefields&quot; in handling domestic and foreign affairs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Austin&#39;s &quot;B-side&quot; is considered by the outside world to be the &quot;three sins&quot; required by the Republican Party to reduce his salary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Secretary Austin is not doing his job. In fact, he is destroying our military.&quot; Green criticized Austin and said the current draft number is at &quot;crisis levels.&quot; , if assistance continues to be provided to the Ukrainian conflict, &quot;this will undoubtedly lead us to World War III.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Crime&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently, the difficulty in recruiting soldiers is the U.S. military One of the “old and difficult” problems we face. Draft numbers are down, suicide rates are up, and the cohesion of the military is plummeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the five branches of the Department of Defense, only the Marine Corps and the Space Force have achieved their active duty recruitment goals for fiscal year 2023. The Army, Air Force, and Navy None of them achieved their goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although the U.S. military has adopted many innovative ways to encourage young people to join the military, including the Army reusing the slogan &quot;Do your best&quot; from the 1980s, the Air Force has relaxed Following previous tattoo and drug testing policies, the Navy introduced record financial incentives of up to $140,000. But in the end, these three services still failed to achieve their recruitment goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The United States has encountered various problems and dilemmas in recruiting troops, withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, and responding to Ukraine. Among these problems and dilemmas, a large number of Part of it is a waste of U.S. national power and reduces the U.S.’s international prestige.&quot; Yang Zhen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At a time when recruitment is difficult, the U.S. Army will cut about 3,000 personnel, or about 10% of the number of special operations forces. Included in psychological operations, civil affairs, intelligence personnel, communications units, logistics and other support services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Austin has not yet signed the final documents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wisconsin Rep. Derek Van Orden expressed support for Greene&#39;s amendment, noting that suicide rates among active-duty service members and veterans are high in 2021. Thirteen soldiers died during the withdrawal from Afghanistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many outsiders believe that the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan has become a &quot;joke&quot; in U.S. military history. The hasty retreat of U.S. forces and the chaos at Kabul airport resulted in the deaths of thirteen U.S. service members in the attack in Kabul. During this withdrawal, Austin was accused by public opinion of failing to properly handle this major military operation, which caused the US military to be in trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Austin abandoned thousands of American citizens and allies to terrorists in Afghanistan. He should be directly responsible for this incident.&quot; Former US Navy SEAL Team member Van Orden said publicly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The main contradiction currently facing the United States is the contradiction between the rising cost of maintaining hegemony and the gradually declining comprehensive national strength.&quot; Yang Zhen believes that &quot;from At this point, Austin lacks the political wisdom and strategic vision required for this position.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the U.S. House of Representatives also pointed out that the United States has invested in Ukraine The huge amount of funds has failed to bring substantial strategic benefits to the country. Austin&#39;s failure to provide effective leadership on this issue has cast doubt on U.S. military policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since Russia launched the conflict against Ukraine in February 2022, the Biden administration, with the support of Congress, has provided nearly $75 billion in aid to Ukraine. Includes humanitarian, economic and military support. However, various opinion polls show that there is growing doubt in the United States about the need to continue providing additional assistance to Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Yuanxi believes that after Austin came to power, in the process of assisting Ukraine, an alliance of 54 countries was formed to jointly support Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The first bird is shot&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On one side is the Republican Party The other side is the support of the Democrats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Austin has played an important role in helping Ukraine and strengthening defense partnerships around the world.&quot; Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said of Austin defended his performance and said Democrats viewed the Republican pay cut proposal for Austin as a &quot;political stunt.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2023/09/21/house-gop-plans -to-pass-defense-budget-fail-again-as-shutdown-looms/&quot;>;As part of the debate over the fiscal 2024 defense appropriations bill&lt;/a>;, Republican lawmakers approved multiple similar proposals to cut their Don&#39;t like the pay for DoD jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many interviewed experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that since the bill must pass the Democratic-controlled Senate and be signed by Biden, it is unlikely to be passed. But it marks yet another Republican rebuke of America’s current military leadership and reflects the country’s growing partisan divide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Yuanxi believes that cutting the salary of the Secretary of Defense is an emotional expression of the Republican Party’s opposition to Biden’s administration. The main purpose is to &quot;disgust&quot; Biden and pave the way for Trump&#39;s election. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This time the House of Representatives has adopted a tactic of clipping its wings. The target is directly at Biden, almost explicitly accusing him of improper employment.&quot; Yang Zhen believes that the House of Representatives believes that Austin is not up to the job, and destroying the U.S. armed forces is not an exaggeration. This is Biden&#39;s biggest problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2023, the results of a poll conducted by the American Gallup Consulting Company, a public opinion polling agency, showed that opinions between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party continue to diverge. It is difficult to reach consensus on most issues, and American politics is increasingly divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Yuanxi believes that the fight between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party in the United States is to attack President Biden and the Democratic Party by finding the weaknesses of a person in such a sensitive position as the Secretary of Defense. In fact, this is the result of a struggle between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of September 28, the U.S. House of Representatives voted on four separate appropriation bills. The four appropriation bills involved defense, homeland security, agriculture, and the State Department respectively. and external affairs. Three bills related to defense, homeland security, and the State Department and Foreign Affairs were passed, while the bill related to agriculture was vetoed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is noteworthy is that this budget dispute not only reflects the long-term contradictions between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, but also creates a &quot;superposition of contradictions&quot; within the Republican Party, creating a complicated situation . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The dispute between the two parties has no bottom line.&quot; Yang Zhen analyzed that in the American political arena, the dispute between the two parties is the main theme, and the current security situation is not a problem for the United States. It is not optimistic. The opposition party&#39;s demand to reduce the salary of the Minister of Defense to US$1 is actually putting the interests of the party above the interests of the country. &quot;This is a very dangerous sign.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;To some Republicans, all Democrats are bad people, and vice versa.&quot; Dr. Todd Grande, a well-known American sociologist, once said Publicly stated, “This is a very simple and quite dangerous way of looking at the world.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 3, the U.S. House of Representatives dismissed the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives. McCarthy&#39;s motion was voted on, and the result was a narrow vote of 216 in favor and 210 against, passing the motion to remove McCarthy. This also marked McCarthy as the first speaker of the House of Representatives to be voted out of office in the history of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This recall incident has made American public opinion believe that the political struggle between the two parties will become more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Zhen analyzed that this incident left several impressions on voters: first, Biden made a mistake in employing personnel, and his own ability to exercise power is questionable; second, Biden&#39;s ability to exercise power is questionable; It is because the senior officials of the Biden administration are not qualified for their jobs, and this administration must step down; third, all the security problems facing the United States today are due to the Biden administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the degree of political division and intensification of conflicts in the United States, the 2024 election year is destined to be full of uncertainty. Where will the future of American politics go? Still remains to be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Lin Xi also contributed to this article)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[怀化乡村：拨开云雾，宛若仙境]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258935]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[凯文·凯利：乐观正成为当下的稀缺品]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258993]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/rtQ8pkH6qICN7d7zir27NV4LHexFToo0mwhK5VQt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/rtQ8pkH6qICN7d7zir27NV4LHexFToo0mw hK5VQt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254477&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Future Emperor&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 12, 2023, outside the Reading Theater of the East Branch of Shanghai Library, the rain was pouring. In the reception room on the basement floor, KK was discussing the process with two guest hosts, and the camera was pointed at them. An hour ago, KK had just finished an exclusive interview with Southern People Weekly. This was the third media he received that day. The chicken sandwich prepared by the organizer had been lying on the table for more than half an hour, with no intention of being opened. In 12 minutes, the signing event for his new book &quot;Precious Life Advice&quot; will begin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;KK wears a decent shirt, trousers and sneakers. He is 71 years old, with a sparse top of his head, leaving only the white hair on his temples and a white beard that stretches from his chin to the side of his face. After nearly 14 hours of flight, he arrived in Shanghai from San Francisco the night before. At this moment, even with a 15-hour time difference and being crammed into a tight schedule, the fatigue in those blue eyes only flashed past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;KK is the abbreviation of Kevin Kelly, the founding editor-in-chief of the well-known technology magazine &quot;Wired&quot; and the author of &quot;Out of Control&quot;. Chinese readers often call him this. Kelly&#39;s most influential work in China is &quot;Out of Control&quot; written in the early 1990s. This book was once one of the must-read books for the protagonists of &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) before reading the script. It was called &quot;the book of the 1990s&quot; by Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and the author of &quot;The Long Tail Theory&quot;. One of the most valuable books of the era.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading often and always new is one of its value expressions. If you open this book on Douban Reading, you will find that comments from readers from all over the world are densely dotted between the paragraphs. Until the ChatGPT craze in early 2023, there were still articles citing Kelly&#39;s view that &quot;machines are becoming biological, and organisms are being engineered.&quot; &quot;In releasing the power of life into the machines we create, we also lose control of them. They gain wildness, and with that wildness come some surprises and surprises. And then, that is what all creators must face The dilemma: They would no longer fully own their proudest creation,&quot; Kelly wrote in &quot;Out of Control.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book was first published in the United States in 1995. To the public, in an era when computers were still mainly used for office work and production, the concepts such as cloud computing, blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and digital currency discussed in &quot;Out of Control&quot; seemed too advanced. . This 528-page &quot;big book&quot; was not popular in the United States at that time, and it would be 15 years before it was truly &quot;born at the right time&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of 2008, Kelly received a special email in his mailbox. The sender is a Chinese named Zhao Jiamin. At that time, the latter had just taken over as the general manager of the community translation platform &quot;Yiyan&quot; and was eager to explore the platform&#39;s business model. He had high hopes for translation and publishing. Which book should I start with? Zhao Jiamin thought of &quot;Out of Control&quot; recommended by a friend not long ago. It was a book that he fell in love with just by flipping through the catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The year &quot;Out of Control&quot; was published in the United States, Zhao Jiamin was still an undergraduate student in the Automation Department of Tsinghua University. A few years later, he went to the University of Southern California to further his studies and received a doctorate in industrial systems engineering, and then joined Oracle to engage in technology development. For Zhao Jiamin, who has a technical background, he chose this old book not because of his optimism about its potential market value, but because the &quot;complex systems&quot; discussed in the book are a topic that he has been interested in since college. The &quot;complex systems&quot; theory emerged in the 1990s, advocating the use of interdisciplinary methods to study the unified laws behind various complex systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a morning, Zhao Jiamin made the decision to buy the rights to publish this book in China. However, Kelly did not have high expectations for how much new royalties the Chinese market could bring. Instead, it was Zhao Jiamin&#39;s idea of ​​using &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; translation that aroused his interest. Kelly once described the operation of &quot;hive mind&quot; in nature in &quot;Out of Control&quot;. Now this collaborative thinking will promote the implementation of its Chinese version, which makes him &quot;amazed&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;Out of Control&quot; was released in China much later than Zhao Jiamin expected. During this period, it went through various twists and turns, such as the integration of the collaborative translation team, the separation of Yiyan.com, Zhao Jiamin&#39;s departure and starting a new business, etc. It was already the second half of 2010 when the review was completed. Under the background of &quot;nothing to delay&quot;, this book was launched at the end of 2010. Coincidentally, it was precisely the various &quot;out of control&quot; in the early stage that made the publication of &quot;Out of Control&quot; the perfect time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, with the popularization of smartphones and 4G networks, China made great strides from the PC Internet era to the mobile Internet era. When &quot;Out of Control&quot; was published in China, WeChat had been launched less than two months ago, Xiaomi and Meituan had only been established for nine months, and Alibaba had just achieved sustained profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;That year was a typical dividing point, and China&#39;s economy was about to enter a new upward cycle. If at this time, a highly regarded book tells you that there are traces to follow in the future, then no matter what Whether it is for psychological or financial reasons, of course there will be demand.&quot; Zhao Jiamin recalled to &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot;. In the Chinese translation, the subtitle of the book was changed from &quot;The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World&quot; to &quot;The Ultimate Fate and Outcome of All Humanity.&quot; Today, Zhao Jiamin still laments that the timing of publication is rare but cannot be sought, &quot;If it had been published a year earlier, it would probably have been unknown. A year late, the moment before dawn has been missed again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Out of Control&quot; &quot;After the publication, Kelly came to China for a week to participate in publicity. Zhao Jiamin described Kelly as one of the few foreign authors he had ever seen who was &quot;especially cooperative&quot;. The publishing team arranged more than a dozen interviews and five or six speeches for Kelly, which he readily accepted and gave his all. Relying on this round of intensive publicity, Kelly gained his first batch of readers in China and was able to establish his reputation among relevant practitioners, scholars who are sensitive to new technologies, and the media. It was precisely with this foreshadowing that &quot;Out of Control&quot; was able to catch another &quot;express train&quot; soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2012, Kelly went to China again. At the Tencent Beijing Clubhouse, talking side by side with Kelly was Tencent CEO Ma Huateng. The latter ranked fourth on the Forbes China Rich List that year. Since 2010, Tencent has been locked in the &quot;3Q war&quot; with Qihoo 360. Just ten days before this conversation took place, both parties announced that they would file lawsuits against the other party for their unethical behavior and abuse of market dominance during the 3Q war. According to Zhao Jiamin&#39;s recollection, Tencent was in urgent need of finding a suitable guest speaker to raise its voice in this public opinion war. Zhao Jiamin recommended Kelly, &quot;He was one of the few choices at the time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the conversation, Ma Huateng said that practitioners, including himself, were &quot;like frogs at the bottom of a well&quot; and &quot;trapped in a certain limited range.&quot; Inside, there is no way to globally observe the changes in the entire industry and the entire environmental ecology.&quot; We hope to get &quot;more forward-looking guidance&quot; from Kelly. The dialogue between the two parties covered topics such as corporate management, monopoly, personal privacy and Internet mobility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this &quot;peak dialogue between the &#39;Future Emperor&#39; and the &#39;Product Emperor&#39;&quot; promoted by the media, Kelly and his &quot;Out of Control&quot; became famous in China. Zhao Jiamin recalled to &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that the sales of &quot;Out of Control&quot; jumped from a few thousand copies at the end of the previous year to tens of thousands. &quot;As a &#39;big book&#39;, this number is far beyond expectations.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Prophet&quot;, &quot;Prophet&quot;, &quot;Godfather&quot;...the titles superimposed in front of Kelly&#39;s Chinese name are becoming more and more abundant. The popularity across the ocean surprised Kelly at the time. &quot;Although the sales of this book in the United States are getting better and better, it is far behind that in China. There is little competition among books of the same type. At that time, China&#39;s Internet had just begun. At first, I was surprised that so many people could find resonance in my book.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Invitations to speak came one after another. In 2014, Kelly was invited to attend the Zhejiang Entrepreneurs Conference. In the previous two conferences, the invited foreign guests were Jim Rogers, a well-known investor who has long been optimistic about China, and John Nesbitt, the author of &quot;Megatrends&quot;. &quot;You have to believe in the impossible. The greatest product in 20 years has not yet been invented!&quot; Kelly sounded encouraging at the end of his hour-and-a-half speech. Then, four words appeared on the huge screen - &quot;You are not late (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It&#39;s not too late to act now)&lt;/span>;! &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Kelly had published many works such as &quot;What Technology Wants&quot; in China. He is still diligent in promoting. After leaving the large-scale business event with security personnel in Hangzhou, he rushed to Shanghai the next day to attend a book signing in a bookstore and talk to dozens of readers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of Kelly&#39;s invited public speeches are about trends, which has always been his biggest selling point in China. In 2016, &quot;Inevitability&quot; was published in China. In the book, he listed &quot;12 inevitable technological forces&quot; that &quot;will shape the next 30 years&quot;. &quot;When our use of technology is close to the trajectory preferred by technology, we will be able to manage complexity, optimize interests and We are better at reducing the harm caused by technology.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like many well-known futurists, Kelly emphasized in the preface that “these forces are not destiny, but trajectories.” However, this does not affect the ability to take &quot;Logical Thinking&quot;, who won the rights to the world premiere of the book, said in the promotional copy that it &quot;predicts which areas will have major wealth opportunities in the next 30 years.&quot; Public information shows that the paper version of the book sold more than 100,000 copies in the first month after its release. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&quot;Out of Control&quot; is the most famous in China, &quot;What Technology Wants&quot; is regarded by Kevin as the culmination of his thoughts, and &quot;Inevitable&quot; is the output of applying this methodology.&quot; In Zhao Jiamin It seems that the greatest value of Kelly&#39;s work is not prediction, but providing a technical philosophical framework that integrates complex fields such as machines, systems, biology and society. &quot;In this sense, these books are not outdated today.&quot; , human beings&#39; understanding of technology and human nature is still full of confusion and contradictions. But compared to obscure philosophy, most people&#39;s expectations will be more utilitarian - to see the future first. This is understandable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/B1k8KBSpzTnQT9Ec4mCteOlBadSv8RZaQUdpKRda.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/B1k8KBSpzTnQT9Ec4mCteOlBadSv8RZaQUdpKRda.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254472&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhao Jiamin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New topic&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recipient Affected by the new crown epidemic, Kelly last visited China four years ago. As of early September 2023, there are only two direct flights per week from San Francisco, where he lives, to Shanghai. &quot;There used to be several shifts every day,&quot; Kelly said with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U.S. Department of Transportation announced in August 2023 that starting from September 1, Chinese airlines will be allowed to operate 18 pairs of direct round-trip passenger flights between China and the United States every week, and from October 29 Increased to 24 pairs per week (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Note: the number in August was only 12&lt;/span>;). However, according to data from aviation data analysis company Cirium (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ruisiyu)&lt;/span>;, the international flight capacity of the Chinese aviation industry in October 2023 The overall level was 54.7% of the pre-epidemic level; during the National Day holiday, routes to Japan, South Korea and Central Europe recovered quickly, while flights between China and the United States remained at a very low level compared with 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Normally, there are more foreigners on flights to China. I didn&#39;t pay special attention this time, but it seemed that most of the people on the plane were Chinese faces.&quot; Kelly recalled to &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; the day before What you see on board. On the night he arrived in Shanghai on September 11, he went to the Bund specifically. The landscape lighting themed light and shadow show that he often remembered in the past was not staged, but the familiar popularity still came to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kelly came to Shanghai just a few days before the 34th Shanghai Tourism Festival. Promotional slogans - &quot;Into Beauty and Joy&quot; are hung on both sides of some main roads. In the first half of 2023, Shanghai&#39;s cultural tourism consumer market took the lead in the country in accelerating recovery. The city received 139 million domestic tourists and achieved domestic tourism revenue of 155.019 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of more than 100%. In contrast, the number of inbound tourists in the first half of the year was only 1.24 million, less than 13% of 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Bill Gates, who also visited China again after four years in June, said, &quot;In four years, the world has undergone tremendous changes.&quot; Leaving the bustling crowd on the Bund, Kelly found himself in Another context. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being invited to attend the 2023ESG Global Leaders Conference, another important task of Kelly&#39;s trip is to promote his new book &quot;Precious Life Advice&quot;. On his 68th birthday, Kelly began penning down some life advice for his children. In the following years, he continued to write new ones, &quot;getting pleasure from compression and decompression&quot;, and finally selected 500 pieces to be collected into a book. Different from tomes that require careful consideration of words and sentences, this booklet of about 200 pages is more in line with the &quot;short, flat and quick&quot; public reading purpose in the fragmented era. It seems that everyone can get some resonance, inspiration, or relief from it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 12, when I walked through the crowds queuing up to buy books and arrived at the venue, it was still 5 minutes before the official start of the event at 6:30. The theater, which can accommodate more than 700 people, is already 70% full. I was sitting in the middle of the venue. On the left was a girl holding a pink Stella Dew plush backpack. She was taking a selfie with Kelly&#39;s new book. On the right was a middle-aged man wearing a dark blue polo shirt and a primary school student of about third or fourth grade. ; In the front are an old woman with a white bun, a young woman eager to stuff tomatoes into her mouth, and a young man wearing a Hawaiian-style short-sleeved shirt with white flowers and red bottom; in the aisle, there is another man holding a The young father of a several-month-old baby paces back and forth. Even though it was a working day and a rainy day, the venue was almost full after an hour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this conversation that lasted for an hour and a half, Xu was following the theme of his new book, and &quot;lying flat&quot; became the most common topic mentioned by the guests and questioners on the spot. In fact, Kelly is no stranger to this term. In a media interview earlier that day, he had already learned the accurate pronunciation of this Chinese word from the reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I lie down every night.&quot; Kelly joked when answering the host Dong Chenyu, a lecturer at the School of Journalism at Renmin University of China, about whether young people in the United States will &#39;lie down&#39;. He went on to mention his own experience, &quot;In the 1960s, I experienced the hippie movement. At that time, young people&#39;s &#39;lying flat&#39; was a rebellion against the existing system. In a sense, &#39;lying flat&#39; is not without value. .I often encourage people to do things when they are young that have nothing to do with society&#39;s definition of success, to do things that are a &#39;waste of time&#39; and have no immediate reward. These experiences will become your muse later in life. Of course, you will eventually You need to stand up one day, because only creating new is a rebellion against the old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The topic did not end easily. In the question-and-answer session later, a female audience member who looked to be in her early twenties asked again, &quot;How should young people deal with the current situation of &#39;can&#39;t roll up and can&#39;t lie flat&#39;?&quot; The audience burst into laughter. After several minutes of relay translation between the two hosts, I’m not sure whether Kelly could understand the twists and turns behind this repeatedly stated question. Kelly attempts to express the inevitability of living with contradiction. &quot;So I should accept the status quo?&quot; the girl concluded, disappearing into another round of laughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the conversation ended, I dispersed with the crowd. Several men in their 40s gathered together to discuss how they &quot;didn&#39;t enjoy themselves&quot; during the dialogue and question-and-answer sessions. They are obviously more interested in Kelly&#39;s &quot;technological prophecies&quot; than &quot;life mottos.&quot; I told Zhao Jiamin the feedback from these &quot;technical fans&quot;. &quot;Most people born in the 70s and 80s became fans of Kevin through &quot;Out of Control&quot;. The establishment of many people&#39;s technical ideological systems, including myself, was somewhat influenced by him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years have passed by. &quot;Financial Eleven&quot; wrote in &quot;The Sharp Decline of China&#39;s Unicorns: Helplessness and Vitality&quot; that most of China&#39;s existing leading unicorn companies were established around 2012, and the mobile Internet, which has a low threshold for entrepreneurship, was once the best However, with the end of the mobile Internet dividend period and changes in the general environment, the necessary factors that contributed to the birth of unicorns are weakening or even disappearing. Today, investment is still strong in robotics, semiconductors and ESG (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Environment, social and corporate governance&lt;/span>;) and other fields. People have to adapt to the new cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Jiamin can understand the differences in concerns of different groups and different stages of life. This is not a different response to anxiety. Some people hope to find opportunities on the &quot;map of the future&quot;; some people suffer from internal friction in &quot;rolling&quot; and &quot;lying down&quot; and hope to find concentration in the wise man&#39;s mottos. As Kelly said in &quot;Precious Life Advice,&quot; &quot;My suggestions are not rules. They are like hats. If one doesn&#39;t fit, try another.&quot; People are constantly &quot;trying on hats.&quot; ”, because the days are always moving forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A well-known futurist once defined his role this way - &quot;facilitate complex conversations about the future, inspire others to think incredible things, and challenge their biases and assumptions about the past, present and future.&quot; In this sense, four years later, Kevin Kelly, a 71-year-old American futurist, will find that the high-spirited Chinese readers he was once familiar with are giving him more difficult problems. After all, there may be traces of the &quot;inevitable&quot; inner trend, but no one can give an accurate answer on how to heal the &quot;out of control&quot; present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djjsGL5twqf7s0xD4VNzPkUj7j89ZDG6eKEKuy89.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djjsGL5twqf7s0xD4VNzPkUj7j89ZDG6eKEKuy89.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254475&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 15, 2017, Kevin Kelly (left) watched robot operation at the Singularity Robot Experience Hall of Zhejiang Robot Industry Group&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Talk about direction, not destination&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the most interesting part of your job, and what is the most challenging? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t have a “career” in the traditional sense. I&#39;ve been very lucky to have always climbed the ladder of my interests. I am my own boss, I control my own time, and if I can do that I am one of the richest people in the world. The most challenging thing is how to take full advantage of this and create something that only I can create. As I wrote in &quot;Valuable Life Advice,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t be the best, be the only one.&quot; I don&#39;t want to spend my limited time doing things that everyone else can do. It can be difficult, especially for young people, to figure out your relative strengths. When you are young, it doesn&#39;t matter if you can&#39;t find the exact answer, you can work towards it. This is why I like to talk about directions rather than destinations. You may never reach your destination, but you can keep moving toward it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 20 to 27 years old, you are an independent The photographer has traveled to more than a dozen Asian countries and regions.

I have witnessed first-hand the dramatic changes that the use of new technologies has brought to people&#39;s lives there, and how third world countries that cannot feed themselves have become among the richest countries in the world. That experience cultivated my optimism and allowed me to talk about technology in a more confident way, not from a purely technical perspective, but from a technical and cultural perspective. This has also become my uniqueness. Your uniqueness is based not only on your talents, interests, and habits, but also on your experiences. So, your twenties are the perfect time to do something unusual, strange, daring, risky, unexplainable, and unprofitable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Rsys9OtcHHcniWm2MPlduoBfiybFRq8zST6H3dD0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;652&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Rsys9OtcHHcniWm2MPlduoBfiybFRq8zST6H3dD0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254480&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Kevin Kelly at the book signing event&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(CITIC Publishing Group/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;Optimism is becoming a scarce commodity&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Originally What inspired you to write &quot;Out of Control&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was very early (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1985 Before and after&lt;/span>;) came into contact with the Internet. In 1987, I heard that the first artificial life symposium would be held in Los Alamos. That seminar was a strange hybrid, involving the intersection of computers, artificial life, biology, and cybernetics. I had never seen a conference like this anywhere else and I knew I couldn&#39;t miss it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was strapped for cash at the time. After buying the air tickets, I could no longer afford the hotel. The seminar lasted three or four days. I spent the day at the venue and spent the night at a nearby campsite. The seminar held a total of about 60 speeches, and I attended all of them. The content of the speeches was very novel and interesting. Later, I compiled the key information of each speech and published it on the Internet. Although the audience was small, the response was very enthusiastic, so I came up with the idea of ​​writing a book on technology integration. This is my first book. I started writing in 1990 and it took about three years to complete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In a period of rapid economic growth, people are full of longing for the future.

They not only sell well at the box office, but also gain widespread cultural influence. Just like after watching the &quot;Terminator&quot; series, you will naturally worry about the fatal consequences of the future development of artificial intelligence. Too many people put too much energy into rehearsing all kinds of scary things in advance, which can make positive rehearsing seem unattainable.

The leader of the coup and the former captain of the presidential guard deposed President Ba Zum stopped exporting uranium ore to France. After negotiations between the two sides failed, French President Macron announced that he would withdraw all troops stationed in Nigeria by the end of this year. How much impact will this have on the “return to Africa” strategy proposed by the French government a few years ago? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To predict this, we must first understand the concepts of &quot;French Africa&quot; ​​and &quot;CFA Franc&quot; in African geopolitics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;French-speaking Africa&quot; ​​and &quot;African Franc&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As an old colonial power, France had nearly 13 million square kilometers of colonies at its peak, ranking second after the United Kingdom. Its colonies are mainly in Africa, and once occupied 37% of the total area of ​​Africa. Such a vast African area, with French as the official language, is called &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After World War II, the &quot;anti-colonialism&quot; movement rose around the world. France sent troops to suppress the independence movements in Indochina and Algeria. After the defeat of the war, France realized that &quot;colonialism&quot; was over and followed this historical trend. Former French colonies became independent one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 1960s, the colonial systems of Britain and France have completely collapsed. In the &quot;post-colonial era&quot;, the relationship between the old colonial empires and the former colonies of the Third World has gradually entered the realm of equality at the international political level. era. Of course, due to uneven development in other aspects such as economy, technology, culture, society, and life, Western countries have market advantages in international commerce and trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 1945, the French government issued the &quot;French African Colonial Franc&quot;. Each French colony in Africa established a &quot;business account&quot; in the French Ministry of Finance and deposited all foreign exchange into this account. The fixed exchange ratio between the &quot;French franc&quot; and the &quot;Chinese franc&quot; is 1:1.7. As of 1949, France controlled 80% of the exports and 75% of the imports of African colonies through financial means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1958, France formulated the &quot;Constitution of the Fifth Republic&quot; and changed the &quot;French Federation&quot; to the &quot;French Community&quot;. Each member state of the &quot;Community&quot; enjoys autonomy in domestic affairs, economy, etc., but foreign affairs, defense, etc. are still controlled by France. After 1960, 12 countries in the &quot;community&quot; became independent. In 1961, the &quot;Community&quot; Senate announced its dissolution. Since then, France has maintained relatively close bilateral relations with the original Community member states in the form of bilateral treaties, trade agreements, and &quot;associated countries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the collapse of the French colonial system, French African countries became independent one after another. The new African states banded together to negotiate with the French government. These newly independent French African countries formed the &quot;Monetary Union of West African Countries&quot; in 1962, and the &quot;Bank of Central African States&quot; was established in 1972. These two central bank systems uniformly issue the legal tender of these new countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;West African CFA Franc (FCFA): 8 countries including Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d&#39;Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo formed the &quot;West African Economic and Monetary Union&quot; and issued The currency is called the &quot;CFA franc&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;West African CFA franc&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Central African CFA Franc (CFAF): Cameroon, Central Africa, Congo (Brazzaville), Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Chad and other six countries form the &quot;Central African Economic and Monetary Community&quot;, called &quot;African Financial Cooperation&quot; franc&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Chinese CFA franc&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;CFA Franc Zone&quot; covers 15 African countries south of the Sahara (the island nation of Comoros in the Indian Ocean, which issues the Comorian franc separately) with a population of approximately 155 million. The exchange rates of &quot;West African CFA franc&quot; and &quot;Central CFA franc&quot; are equal, but they cannot circulate with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1960, France issued the New Franc (Nouveau Franc), whose currency value was determined to be 100 times that of the old Franc, equivalent to 0.1802 grams of gold content. The fixed exchange ratio between the French franc and the CFA franc is 1:50. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s and 1990s, Africa&#39;s economic development was slow, stagnant, and even seriously regressed. Fiscal deficits in various countries soared, inflation was serious, and debt problems intensified. The global financial community generally believed that the &quot;CFA franc&quot; was overvalued. With the intervention of the &quot;World Bank&quot; and the &quot;International Monetary Fund (IMF)&quot;, in 1994, the fixed exchange ratio between the &quot;French franc&quot; and the &quot;CFA franc&quot; , adjusted to 1:100. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 1999, the &quot;EU&quot; recognized the currency cooperation agreement between France and the CFA franc zone, and approved the &quot;CFA franc&quot; to be officially linked to the upcoming euro, with a fixed exchange rate of (CFA franc: euro) 655.957: 1. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Political Independence Vs Economic or Monetary &quot;Dependence&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Now that these former French African countries have achieved political independence, why do they have to be closely linked to France in terms of economy, especially currency? The reason is: the social structure and economic development of these African countries are backward, and their national economies are completely dependent on France. Modern currency is no longer a physical currency defined by the gold standard, silver standard or bi-standard precious metals, but has evolved into a national credit symbol. Banknotes that lack credibility will not be recognized by the international community, and the region&#39;s economy will collapse. After currency collapse, great social unrest, or even horrific famine and bloody civil war, often occur within a short period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the &quot;Western CFA franc and Central African CFA franc&quot; issued by African countries had to continue to be pegged to the franc. Relying on the credit endorsement of the franc&#39;s international currency status, these countries maintained the general stability for decades after their independence. , for the people there, the more simple function is that the more stable &quot;CFA franc&quot; can buy food and have food to eat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, France made huge profits from the relationship between the franc and the &quot;Chinese franc&quot;, which played an important role in France&#39;s post-war reconstruction and economic revival after World War II. At the same time, black people in &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot; ​​can also take advantage of the exchange of &quot;Chinese francs&quot; with French francs in their hands to go to France to study and do business, creating a large number of &quot;African elites&quot; who accept French thought and culture and speak French. This gives France great ideological, cultural, political and economic advantages in &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot;. At the same time, among the nearly 68 million people in France, there are nearly 8 million blacks (including illegal immigrants), accounting for nearly 12%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the long-term cooperation process, France and Africa compromised with each other: the headquarters of the &quot;Central Bank of West African States&quot; and &quot;Central Bank of Central African States&quot; were moved from Paris to Dakar and Yaounde in Africa respectively. . Alliance member states will adjust the proportion of foreign exchange deposited in the Bank of France from 100% to 65%. The &quot;West African Central Bank&quot; has a 7-member board of directors, with French directors reduced to 2; the &quot;Central African Central Bank&quot; has a 12-member board of directors, with French directors reduced to 3, which greatly reduces the weight of France and increases the rights of Africa. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1973, France signed the &quot;Currency Cooperation Agreement&quot; with the &quot;West African Monetary Union&quot;, defining four principles of currency cooperation:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. The principle of rigid exchange, France ensures the stability of the &quot;West African CFA franc&quot; Exchange rigidity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. The principle of fixed parity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. The principle of free flow, there is no restriction on the flow of funds within the &quot;West African Monetary Union&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;4. On the principle of centralized management of foreign exchange reserves, the proportion of foreign exchange reserves deposited by West African countries in the Bank of France will be reduced to 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the &quot;CFA Franc&quot;, the franc&#39;s international currency status, credit endorsement, and support from the French government (especially France&#39;s commitment to the rigid exchangeability of the &quot;West African CFA franc&quot;) protect the economies of Central Africa and West Africa. It played an important role in maintaining social stability in the former French African region. In the 1970s, life in these African countries was pretty good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 1999, when the euro was born and the French franc withdrew from the stage of history, the &quot;CFA franc&quot; was pegged to the euro at a fixed exchange rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on the long-term stability of the franc and the euro, the &quot;Cfrican franc&quot; has maintained a strong currency value even in the turbulent era of wars, frequent coups, and social crises in other parts of Africa. This has played a vital role in maintaining the existence of the government in &quot;French-speaking African&quot; countries and surviving the continuous wars, coups, economic crises, and social unrest across Africa. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with other regions in Africa, the &quot;CFA Franc Zone&quot; has avoided inflation caused by excessive currency issuance and maintained currency credibility and stability. Between 2014 and 2017, the global inflation rate ranged from 2.8% to 3.2%, and the sub-Saharan (outside the &quot;CFA franc zone&quot;) inflation rate soared from 6.3% to 11.3%. The inflation rate in the &quot;CFA franc zone&quot; has always remained between 0.7% and 1.7%. With good monetary credibility, the &quot;CFA Franc&quot; maintains the record as the longest-lasting fixed exchange rate mechanism in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1994, Central African countries established the &quot;China-Africa Economic and Monetary Union Community&quot;. In addition to the monetary union and economic union, they also established a Community Parliament and a Community Court. In 2000, West African countries formed an economic community with the West African CFA franc as a link, gradually eliminating trade barriers and unifying tariffs within the alliance, and achieving common economic progress and retreat. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;French troops in Africa&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the end of the &quot;Cold War&quot;, ideological conflicts gave way to Huntington&#39;s so-called &quot;clash of civilizations&quot;, and &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot; ​​is no exception. The conflict of civilizations in the context of great power competition for hegemony has even threatened the survival of many African countries. In 2012, the Malian government forces were defeated by the anti-government forces. The Malian government had no choice but to ask France, its former sovereign state, to send troops to rescue them. In 2013, the French army launched &quot;Operation Serval&quot; to drive the anti-government forces into the desert in northern Mali. , helped the Malian government regain most of its territory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current military operations carried out by France in &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot; ​​are not the colonial military aggression of &quot;might is right&quot; two centuries ago, but a stability-maintaining alliance military operation within the framework of modern international law. A hallmark of this type of action is that it requires a formal invitation from a legitimate government. If the local government does not agree to the continued presence of foreign troops, the French troops will have to withdraw. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The withdrawal of the French army from Niger is an example of this type of military operation: the French army was invited by the legitimate government of Niger to come to &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; (maintain stability). However, a military coup occurred in Niger. Although the current regime lacked legitimacy, it issued an expulsion order and the French army had to withdraw. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;From West African CFA Franc to Eco? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;France considers that ancient &quot;colonialism&quot; is gone forever. The so-called &quot;return to Africa&quot; ​​strategy refers to France using a modern social form to rebuild an equal relationship with &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot;. New inter-state relations. The first priority is currency, and the major decision made by France is to support the currency reform of &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 21, 2019, French President Macron reached an agreement with the Chairman of the &quot;West African Economic and Monetary Union&quot; and announced that he was preparing to abolish the &quot;West African CFA Franc&quot; and use a new currency &quot;Eco&quot; in 2020. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This currency reform has three main changes:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. Abolish the West African CFA franc and use the new currency Eco. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. The Central Bank of West Africa will no longer hand over 50% of its foreign exchange to France for management and can freely configure its foreign exchange portfolio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. France withdrew and no longer sent representatives to the &quot;West African Economic and Monetary Union&quot; banking institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, after the &quot;West African CFA Franc&quot; was reformed into Eco, two &quot;unchanges&quot; were maintained:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First: Eco is still pegged to the euro, maintaining a fixed exchange rate of 655.957:1. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second: France’s commitment to West African countries remains unchanged, and it can provide foreign exchange support if there is a crisis in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of the &quot;West African CFA franc&quot; is one of the important measures in France&#39;s &quot;return to Africa&quot; ​​strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;France aims to promote the economic integration of the &quot;West African CFA franc zone&quot; in order to attract countries such as Nigeria and Ghana outside the franc zone to join. As the original initiator and guarantor of this new economic cooperation zone, France will have the greatest say in the currency union and become the biggest beneficiary of Africa&#39;s cheap labor and abundant natural resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the countries in the &quot;West African CFA franc zone&quot;: having the right to issue currency conforms to their domestic &quot;financial nationalism&quot; trend and is conducive to increasing the government&#39;s reputation and safeguarding the survival of the regime. Most West African countries are small in size and have small economies. There is no economic power in the region to guarantee support for the implementation of a unified currency, so they must rely on France for support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, if countries outside the alliance (Nigeria, Ghana) can meet certain economic and other conditions, Eco does not rule out the possibility of attracting them to join, thereby establishing a larger monetary union. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously: France’s goal is to focus on Nigeria. Nigeria is not only rich in oil resources, but also has a population of more than 200 million and maintains the highest fertility rate in the world. Some scholars predict that Nigeria&#39;s population may reach about 700 million by the late 21st century. According to some schools of thought, the &quot;demographic dividend&quot; is huge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the agreement, the issuance of the new currency Eco requires each country to meet certain economic indicators as a threshold, such as: fiscal deficit does not exceed 3% of GDP, inflation is within 10%, and public debt does not exceed 70% of GDP. etc., it is still a test for these countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of 2022, neither the &quot;West African CFA franc zone&quot; countries nor French officials have announced a specific timetable for Eco&#39;s advancement. Affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, West African countries have experienced sharp declines in fiscal revenue, sharp increases in public expenditures, and high fiscal deficits. They are unable to reach the previously preset threshold, and the issuance of new currencies will be delayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The French government’s big game in “French-speaking Africa” and the “African Franc Zone” is of course based on French interests. But this is a new arrangement in the &quot;post-colonialism&quot; era. On the one hand, France maintains its influence in these places, but on the other hand, it also has to contribute money, effort and credit. Some countries are not willing to play with France in this way. France They have to withdraw obediently, so France generally plays the role of &quot;big brother&quot; or &quot;co-leader&quot;. If there is a younger brother who does not recognize this &quot;big brother&quot; or does not recognize this &quot;co-leader&quot;, France cannot use force as it did in the past. Therefore, we must examine and study this phenomenon with new thinking, new concepts, and new methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海漄获雨果奖，系刘慈欣、郝景芳之后中国科幻作家第三人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259098]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Chinese writer Hai Miao won the Best Short Novella Award for &quot;The Painter of Time and Space&quot; .

British football star and Manchester United legendary star Sir Bobby Charlton passed away at the age of 86. He was the last player to survive the Munich air disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bobby Charlton, who was born in 1937 and officially retired in 1976, has a career full of honors. He played 758 games for Manchester United, scored 249 goals, and won several English top league championship trophies. He was also the core player of the England team that won the 1966 World Cup. He is both offensive and defensive, his playing style is tough but not rough, and he is known as a &quot;football gentleman&quot;. He is also one of the very few players in the history of football to have won the World Cup trophy, the Champions League trophy and the Ballon d&#39;Or at the same time, collecting the highest honors at the national team, club and individual levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 145-year history of Manchester United, many stars have emerged, but when it comes to the number one legend in history, the vast majority of fans will vote for Bobby Charlton. He is also regarded as the &quot;Chosen One&quot;. As a survivor of the &quot;Munich Air Crash&quot; of Manchester United, he not only defeated fate and himself, but also became the most critical figure in Manchester United&#39;s emergence from the haze. This is not just luck, but also a testament to hard work. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The talented young man from a football family faces the obstacle of a plane crash in his life&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bobby Charlton was born on October 11, 1937 in Northumber, England. Lan County, his family can be called a football family: his father and uncle are both well-known local players, and his brother Jack Charlton later became a star of Leeds United and the main central defender of the England team in the 1966 World Cup. Bobby Charlton entered the Manchester United youth team when he was 12 years old. He officially turned professional in 1954 and won three consecutive English FA Youth Cup championships with the Manchester United youth team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1956, Bobby Charlton made his first-team debut for Manchester United. In this game against Charlton, he scored two goals, establishing himself in the first team at the speed of light, and won the league championship with the team in the 1956-1957 season. But what followed was the Munich air disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;February 6, 1958 was the darkest moment in the history of Manchester United. At that time, Manchester United played away against the Yugoslavian powerhouse Red Star Belgrade in the second leg of the European Champions Cup quarter-finals. The two sides drew 3-3. Manchester United advanced with a total score of 5-4 over the two rounds. After the game, Manchester United players, some fans and reporters with the team planned to take a flight back to the UK. However, the plane at the time could not support the direct flight from Belgrade to England, and they had to stop in Munich for refueling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/UMm4zpLGNVn3UBqxNVyDhZrjABZeOx6dlzbTk39u.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;632&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/UMm4zpLGNVn3UBqxNVyDhZrjABZeOx6dlzbTk39u.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254832&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 30, 1966, London, England, England defeated the Federal Republic of Germany 4-2 in the World Cup final. Bobby Charlton celebrated by holding the Jules Rimet Cup high&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, the rested aircraft failed to take off twice due to engine problems at Munich Airport. On the third During the first takeoff, the plane lost control due to snow accumulation, crashed through a fence and crashed into a building, then broke into two pieces. One side of the fuselage collided with a truck filled with fuel and exploded. 23 of the 44 people on board died, including 21-year-old talented star Duncan Edwards, team captain Roger Byrne and many other players. In addition, there are two players who have completely bid farewell to the court due to injuries. Bobby Charlton was injured but luckily escaped death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plane crash changed Manchester United&#39;s development trajectory. Since being coached by Matt Busby in 1945, Manchester United has prospered and many young players have stood out, including the talented youngster Duncan Edwards who later unfortunately passed away in a plane crash. The team quickly grew into a strong team in English football, first winning the league runner-up four times in five years, and then winning the league championship three times between 1952 and 1957. In the 1957-1958 season, Manchester United was regarded as the favorite for the Champions League, but the Munich air disaster brought everything to an abrupt end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the remaining days of that season, Manchester United, which was once involved in rumors of disintegration, did not miss a single game and relied on a group of young players who were temporarily promoted to play the entire season and win people&#39;s respect. Bobby Charlton also returned to the court as quickly as possible. He has experienced as much pain and hardship as anyone else. In addition to the physical pain, there is also tremendous mental pain. Fortunately, the then Manchester United star finally got over this hurdle and became a key figure in Manchester United&#39;s revival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/pPmFBwTZyrAvHQY9yqBG1ZT16Humc1ZLjlixOV2C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;954&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/pPmFBwTZyrAvHQY9yqBG1ZT16Humc1ZLjlixOV2C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254833&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 25, 1963, Manchester United won the FA Cup.

But it was not until 1963 that it won its first championship after the plane crash - the FA Cup. Among the players on the final field, only Fulks and Bobby Charlton had experienced a plane crash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, Manchester United has officially ushered in a renaissance. In the mid-1960s, it won two league championships in three years, and defeated Portugal&#39;s Benfica in the 1967-1968 European Champions Cup final, winning the UEFA Champions League for the first time in history. To win the Champions League trophy, Bobby Charlton scored two goals in the game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a reincarnation game. Bobby Charlton and his new teammates used the championship trophy to comfort those who passed away. Ten years ago, Manchester United was not far away from this championship trophy, but the air crash shattered their dreams and even lives. At this moment, Bobby Charlton completed his own redemption and the last wishes of his deceased teammates. Both he and Busby cut their middle fingers, soaked the trophy with blood, and lifted it again and again, chanting the name of a deceased teammate each time.

The deadline for feedback is November 19, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, the &quot;Cash Dividend Guidelines&quot; have mainly revised three aspects: first, to further clarify the direction of cash dividends, second to simplify the mid-term dividend procedures, and thirdly to strengthen the constraints on companies that exceed their ability to pay dividends. The &quot;Articles of Association Guidelines&quot; have revised the contents of Articles 153, 155 and 156 related to cash dividends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later on the same day, in accordance with the unified deployment of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges revised the Shanghai Stock Exchange Main Board and Science and Technology Innovation Board, and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Main Board and GEM Standardized Operation Guidelines for Cash Dividends. Public opinion solicitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This revision is a further implementation of the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s active capital market policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission explained that the main idea of ​​this revision of cash dividend rules is to encourage companies to formulate clear dividend policies in their articles of association on the basis of adhering to corporate autonomy, stabilize investors’ dividend expectations, and ensure that non-dividends and financial Companies with large investment scales but low dividend distribution ratios should be urged to pay dividends by strengthening disclosure requirements; facilitate the company&#39;s mid-term dividend implementation procedures and encourage companies to increase the frequency of cash dividends; strengthen constraints on companies with abnormally high dividend distribution ratios and guide reasonable dividend distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 27, the China Securities Regulatory Commission also regulated the behavior of shareholding reductions and introduced a &quot;linking&quot; policy between dividends and shareholding reductions, stipulating that listed companies have broken shares or net losses, or have not distributed cash dividends in the past three years. . If the accumulated cash dividend amount is less than 30% of the average annual net profit in the past three years, the controlling shareholder or actual controller shall not reduce its shareholdings through the secondary market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The annual dividend amount exceeds the amount of equity financing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In recent years, driven by policy guidance and supervision, the dividend situation of A-share listed companies has continued to improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission stated that in the past five years, A-share listed companies have paid a cumulative dividend of 8.2 trillion yuan, and the annual dividend amount has begun to exceed the amount of equity financing that year. Among them, a total of 3,291 Shanghai and Shenzhen listed companies paid cash dividends in 2022, with a dividend amount of 2.1 trillion yuan, of which 1.6 trillion yuan was distributed to domestic investors, a year-on-year increase of 22.7%, and the number of dividend companies accounted for 67.1%. The dividend payout rate (32.5%) and dividend rate (1.97%) are in the middle and upper reaches compared with major global capital markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Kaiyuan, also told Southern Weekend reporters that the cash dividend performance of A-share listed companies has improved significantly compared with ten years ago, and listed companies also hope to enhance investor confidence through cash dividends. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this revision, the &quot;Cash Dividend Guidelines&quot; have detailed regulations and explanations for companies that &quot;evade&quot; dividends and &quot;excessive&quot; dividends. The dividend distribution procedures have also been optimized. The revisions mainly include three aspects: &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is necessary to further clarify the direction of cash dividends and promote an increase in the level of dividends. The first is to strengthen institutional constraints on companies that do not pay dividends and urge them to pay dividends. For companies that have not distributed cash dividends, disclosure requirements will be strengthened. In addition to disclosing specific reasons, they must also disclose the next steps to be taken to enhance investor returns; second, focus on companies with large financial investments but low dividend levels. Pay attention and urge to increase the level of dividends and focus on the main business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, we should simplify the mid-term dividend distribution process and promote further optimization of the dividend method and rhythm. Encourage companies to increase the frequency of dividends when conditions permit, so that investors can share company growth dividends earlier. Combined with regulatory practice, listed companies are allowed to review and approve the conditions and upper limit for the next year&#39;s interim cash dividend within a certain amount when convening the annual shareholders&#39; meeting to review the annual profit distribution plan. Subsequently, the board of directors will formulate a specific interim dividend plan to facilitate the company&#39;s further improvement. The frequency of dividend payments allows investors to better plan capital arrangements and share corporate growth dividends earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must once again strengthen the constraints on companies that pay dividends beyond their capabilities and guide reasonable dividend distribution. First, it is emphasized that when listed companies formulate cash dividend policies, they should comprehensively consider their own profitability, capital expenditure arrangements and debt repayment capabilities, as well as investor returns and company development needs; second, it is emphasized that supervision should be carried out on companies with high asset-liability ratios and cash from operating activities. Companies with poor flow and large proportions of cash dividends should pay close attention to prevent adverse effects on the company&#39;s production, operations and debt solvency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This revision also combines the reform of the independent director system and deletes the relevant requirements for independent directors to express opinions in the &quot;Cash Dividend Guidelines&quot;. At the same time, the adaptability regulations have been modified in conjunction with the registration system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Although cash dividends do not directly increase shareholders’ equity, they are of particular significance to the entire A-share market.” Yang Delong explained that cash dividends on the one hand show that the company has profitability and that there is real money in the account; This aspect shows that the company has sincerity and social responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Delong previously wrote that in the A-share market, some listed companies are profitable but do not pay dividends for a long time, which harms the interests of small and medium investors. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has adopted specific regulations to encourage listed companies to pay cash dividends and strengthen inquiries on companies that have not paid cash dividends for a long time. This will help boost investors’ confidence in listed companies. It also urges the management of listed companies to make the company bigger and stronger, and encourages Major shareholders bind the interests of small and medium-sized investors through cash dividends to promote the establishment of a good ecosystem in the A-share market and the overall improvement of the quality of listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;There is still room for improvement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When issuing the revised instructions, the China Securities Regulatory Commission also emphasized that “compared with mature overseas markets, the balance, timeliness, and Stability needs to be further improved, investors&#39; sense of gain needs to be enhanced, and some companies pay abnormally high proportions of dividends, which may damage debt solvency and continued operating capabilities, requiring timely guidance and regulation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Changjiang Securities is also in the process. A 2023 research report stated that A-share dividend strategies have performed better in recent years, but from a global perspective, there are still differences with overseas mature markets in terms of dividend levels, high dividend yield sectors, and the stability of dividend strategies. The difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of willingness to pay dividends, the total amount of dividends paid in the A-share market has maintained a high growth rate, and the proportion of dividend-paying listed companies has increased year by year. It has a strong dividend investment foundation, but the sustainability and growth of dividends are still inconsistent with There is a certain gap in developed markets such as the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of dividend payout ratio and dividend rate, the Hong Kong market in China is the highest as a whole, and the willingness to pay dividends and dividend rate levels of A-share listed companies are generally in the middle, while the U.S. market is relatively the lowest, with the dividend payout ratio of A-shares in 2022 being about 32.5 %, and the dividend yield is about 1.9%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of dividends, A-share dividends are mainly concentrated on the Shanghai Stock Exchange main board, and central and state-owned enterprises pay greater dividends. Dividends in Hong Kong stocks mainly come from state-owned enterprise stocks, and the total dividends paid by local companies in Hong Kong do not account for a high proportion. Among U.S. stocks, the New York Stock Exchange’s total dividends dominate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of dividend time and frequency, the frequency of dividends in the A-share market is mostly once a year, and the actual time of dividend distribution is mostly concentrated between May and July. The average number of annual dividends for Hong Kong stocks is about 1.5 times, and it is mostly used for U.S. stocks. Quarterly dividend payment method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Compared with U.S. stocks, the cash dividend ratio of A-shares is still low.” Yang Delong said that many companies in the United States repurchase and then cancel their shares to reward investors. Although the number of repurchases and cancellations in the A-share market has increased, in terms of proportion and amount, it is far lower than that of U.S. stocks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yang Delong&#39;s view, cash dividends plus share repurchases and cancellations are the best way to reward investors and are also a direction for future market reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Yang Delong believes that the dividend mechanism of A-shares can be further increased in guidance and mandatory in the future, especially for listed companies with financing needs, requiring them to pay dividends in excess of the IPO financing amount before they can again Financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This can put certain restrictions on the company&#39;s financing behavior and allow it to truly give back to investors instead of constantly asking the market for money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
