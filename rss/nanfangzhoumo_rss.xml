However, in recent years, various routines and suspected cases of &quot;pig killing plate&quot; have occurred frequently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Beijing Business Daily&quot; reported in April this year that Ms. Zhang spent 20,000 yuan on Baihe.com to purchase a &quot;marriage insurance&quot; matchmaking service. The &quot;matchmaker&quot; who matched the service said that she would introduce high-quality men to her, and then successively Recommended 5 men. Ms. Chen mentioned that the five men did not express sufficient communication intentions, did not introduce themselves, and could not confirm the personal information mentioned by the &quot;matchmaker.&quot; Yuyao (pseudonym), who purchased a matchmaking service at Century Jiayuan’s Beijing Anzhen store, also revealed that she signed a contract and paid nearly 100,000 yuan. The store staff promised Yuyao that they would introduce “high-quality men” and “guaranteed success.” After Yuyao connected with several male users, none of them established a relationship between male and female friends. The two women asked for a refund because they were dissatisfied with the services of the dating website, but the other party had to deduct high fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Online social networking is a loose and progressive dating model, but the services provided by dating websites are very purposeful. Men and women who register as members or even purchase paid services have clear demands for marriage and love, and they hope to pass them. Dating and dating websites find people who match their own requirements and have corresponding expectations and measurement standards in terms of appearance, income, position, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mating and dating websites will provide two services for this type of men and women. One is a free registration service. After the user registers, they will &quot;audition&quot; for opposite-sex users who are also registered on the website to find those who meet the conditions and can communicate with each other. of opposite-sex communication. However, this method is inefficient and consumes a lot of time and effort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to save screening costs and improve success rate and safety, some consumers choose paid services provided by dating websites. In this regard, marriage and love websites provide &quot;offline matchmaker&quot; services, which are divided into telephone customer service and emotional consultants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a reporter from The Paper applied for a job and went undercover to enter an offline store of Jiayuan Online. After the short-term training, the store opened back-end permissions for reporters. Through the back-end, they can view the personal information of registered members of Century Jiayuan.com, including the user&#39;s browsing history and chat history. After obtaining the user&#39;s &quot;big data&quot;, the telephone customer service invites the user to the store for an interview through phone calls, text messages, etc. The reporter inquired about the statistics on the number of calls in the background of the system and found that most of the store&#39;s sales made an average of about 100 calls per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a customer comes to the store, the emotional consultant responsible for the interview will use words to guide, for example, &quot;Compared with buying a commercial house worth millions or tens of millions, it is better to spend tens of thousands of dollars to find your lover.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s worth it&quot;, and then displays the high-quality candidate information it has to induce users to sign up and pay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Paper reported: In 2017, Liu Gang, a consumer who had used the &quot;matchmaker one-on-one&quot; service, said that online membership fees are relatively low, and members are charged for sending and viewing messages, and users also pay more every year. It only costs a few hundred yuan in membership fees. Prices for high-end services range from 10,000 to hundreds of thousands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do so many people fall into this trap? The supply and demand relationship in the marriage market also plays a driving role. Century Jiayuan has not announced the proportion of male and female paid members, but Ideal Island VIP, known as the &quot;Master and Doctoral Dating Platform&quot;, released the &quot;2023 Ideal Island VIP User Report&quot; stating that 40.2% of Ideal Island VIP users are men and 59.8% are women. Among them, women account for more than 60% of users in Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shenzhen. It is reported that after becoming the VIP of Ideal Island and searching for the opposite sex, if you need to initiate an exchange WeChat application, you need to pay to purchase a membership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a phenomenon of &quot;more boys and girls&quot; among users of dating websites, or it may be because men often bear the majority of dating expenses for both parties during the relationship, especially men at the bottom of the class who have to pay betrothal gifts when they get married. For the decision-making process of purchasing paid dating services More cautious. Some women consider more based on their age, partner&#39;s income, occupation, etc., and the need to find high-quality men through paid services is more urgent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to understand why female users are more likely to be deceived among the various service traps designed by dating websites. In 2021, Zhejiang Radio and Television&#39;s &quot;Xiaoqiang Online&quot; column reported that Ms. Lu, a Hangzhou citizen, registered as a member of Century Jiayuan in November 2019 and wanted to find a suitable partner. For this reason, she did not hesitate to borrow more than 130,000 yuan to pay the membership fee, because the contract stipulated that as long as she registered for marriage with the person recommended by the matchmaker during the contract period, the membership fee could be returned in full. However, after signing the contract, the candidates recommended by the matchmaker often did not meet Ms. Lu&#39;s standards, and Ms. Lu eventually requested a full refund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the recommended products not matching the previous promises, some users have also encountered suspected &quot;marriage trusteeship&quot; incidents. The Beijing News reported in 2017 that Xiaoqing, who had worked at Zhenai.com and Jiayuan for two years, said that marriage entrustments were common. Some sales matchmakers think that this member is useless, or that the conditions required are difficult to find, so the matchmaker will introduce their people to the other party and make it clear that they cannot establish a relationship, but just gather the number of people and go through the motions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the above incidents that the promises of &quot;full refund on scheduled marriage&quot; and &quot;marriage insurance&quot; services of dating websites are all based on so-called back-and-forth promises to allow female users to fall into their serial routine—— Brainwashing them with words to induce them to pay, and pretending to be a high-quality man as a &quot;marriage agency&quot; during the meeting. Although as early as 2017, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the National Health and Family Planning Commission formulated and issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Further Improving Youth Marriage and Love Work&quot;, requiring the promotion of marriage and dating platforms to strictly implement real-name authentication and real-name registration, and severely crack down on Illegal matchmaking activities such as marriage entrustment and marriage fraud, but relying solely on the self-discipline of dating websites lacks the strength and breadth of normalized governance, making it difficult for users to safeguard their rights, and such routines will continue to spread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一边补贴购车，一边对中国电动车反补贴调查，欧盟为何双标？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256872]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/16/vRua021qrFj0ZpFrqYpZ4Wv0gH0XflmZuPMb1fs2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1062&quot; height=&quot;708&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vRua021qrFj0ZpFrqYpZ4Wv0g H0XflmZuPMb1fs2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250981&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 2023, Munich Auto Show. This year has the largest number of references for Chinese car companies in history. Not only BYD, Xpeng Motors, Leap Motors, SAIC MG, Avita and Cyrus participated in the exhibition, but also CATL, Yiwei Lithium Energy and so on. , Sunwoda and China New Aviation and other parts, software and hardware suppliers. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China&#39;s electric cars, which are rapidly entering the market, have encountered &quot;stumbling blocks.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, in the first eight months of 2023, China&#39;s new energy vehicle exports surged 110% year-on-year. However, on September 13, 2023, European Commission President von der Leyen announced that it would launch a countervailing investigation into electric vehicles from China. The core of the investigation is whether the Chinese government provides subsidies to assess whether the EU needs to impose punitive tariffs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qiu Kaijun, founder of &quot;Electric Vehicle Observer&quot; believes that all countries are introducing policies to support the development of their own electric vehicle industry, and China just implemented subsidies earlier, and there is no legitimacy issue. Moreover, China’s “state subsidy” policy for new energy vehicles has been terminated in 2022, but some EU member states are still subsidizing their own new energy vehicles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 14, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce of China responded that China’s electric vehicle industry has developed rapidly and its competitiveness has continued to improve. This is the result of unremitting technological innovation and the construction of a complete industrial chain and supply chain. China urges the EU to proceed from the overall situation of maintaining the stability of global industrial and supply chains as well as the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership and engage in dialogue and consultation with China. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;China’s “state subsidy” policy for electric vehicles has been withdrawn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“The global market is now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. And huge state subsidies have artificially depressed their prices.” Von der Leyen said that this is the core reason why the EU is considering launching a countervailing investigation into electric vehicles from China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The European Commission said that China’s market share of electric vehicles sold in Europe has risen to 8% and may reach 15% in 2025. This rapid growth in proportion is due to the fact that Chinese electric vehicles generally have a price advantage of about 20% compared to European models. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese government does provide subsidies for electric vehicles, but it also set up an exit mechanism for subsidies very early. At the beginning of 2022, four departments including the Ministry of Finance jointly issued a document clarifying that the new energy vehicle purchase subsidy policy in 2022 will be terminated on December 31, 2022. Subsidies will no longer be provided for vehicles with subsequent license plates, and the &quot;state subsidy&quot; policy for electric vehicles that has continued for 13 years has been officially Withdrew from the stage of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at Europe, many subsidy policies for the electric vehicle industry have been introduced in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Germany provides different subsidies for pure electric vehicles based on the selling price, with the maximum subsidy of 4,500 euros for models under 40,000 euros. In 2023, the car purchase subsidy for ordinary French consumers will be 5,000 euros, and the electric vehicle subsidy for low-income families will increase to 7,000 euros. On February 1, 2023, the European Commission proposed increasing state subsidies to enable EU countries to compete with other countries in the production of electric vehicles and other green products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the development of emerging industries such as electric vehicles, the industrial policies of various countries are very active, but there are differences in degree.&quot; Qiu Kaijun said, &quot;In the early years, the so-called completely free market did not interfere with industrial development at all. The economic theory is actually no longer popular in Europe and the United States, where there is also strong intervention and support for emerging industries.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The impact on Chinese car companies still needs to be observed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to According to EU regulations, countervailing investigations can take up to 13 months, which means that we still need to wait for the &quot;boots to land&quot; in about a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the evening of September 13, Chinese concept stocks of new energy vehicles had already fallen collectively. Xpeng Motors fell 3.11%, Li Auto fell 0.54%, and NIO fell 4.64%. Hong Kong auto stocks fell in late trading, with BYD and Xpeng Motors falling 3.53% and 2.47% respectively, Geely Auto falling 1.52%, and Great Wall Motors, NIO, and Li Auto falling slightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the launch of the anti-subsidy investigation, European policies were relatively friendly, with a tariff of 10% on cars imported from China, while the United States&#39; tariff was 27.5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Kaijun said that the current cost advantage of Chinese car companies is very obvious. If countervailing tariffs are imposed after the investigation, the increase will be small, and Chinese car companies will still be competitive; but if punitive tariffs are imposed, such as 100% or 150%, the blow will be very severe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Forsighted Chinese car companies are preparing to build factories in Europe, and the anti-subsidy investigation may speed up their progress in building factories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dan, a researcher at the Institute of International Affairs of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), suggested that Chinese car companies should strengthen coordination and consultation with the assistance of industry associations, form a joint stance and strategy, and improve the foreign economic and trade legal toolbox , accurately grasp EU legislative information and progress, work closely with the Ministry of Commerce, and negotiate with the European side in the China-EU high-level economic and trade dialogue. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;China has the best electric vehicle industry chain&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Many foreign car companies have factories in China, and the so-called electric vehicles from China also include them. Countervailing investigations will also affect non-Chinese brand models manufactured in China, such as Tesla and BMW. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Foreign brands are willing to set up factories in China, and they are voting with their feet. It is not because China has subsidies, but because China has the best electric vehicle industry chain and good automobile industry workers, just like the Ma Skoda praised the workers at Tesla&#39;s Shanghai Gigafactory for being smart and hard-working,&quot; Qiu Kaijun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 13, the China Chamber of Commerce in the European Union issued a statement that China&#39;s electric vehicles and upstream and downstream industry chain companies have continued to innovate and have accumulated overall industrial advantages in the fierce Chinese local market. This advantage is not based on The so-called huge subsidies are formed. CITIC Securities’ research report also pointed out that China’s current electric vehicles do not rely on low prices as a selling point. Their competitiveness comes from technology accumulation, quality control, and user experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The industrial advantage is reflected in the price advantage. Qiu Kaijun gave an example to Southern Weekend reporters. Volkswagen&#39;s ID.3 model is produced in both China and Germany. It sells for 40,000 euros in Germany, while it sells for about 15,000 euros in China. The huge price difference has caused caused a wave of public opinion in Germany. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a statistics from the research organization JATO Dynamics, since 2015, the average price of electric vehicles in Europe has risen from 49,000 euros to 56,000 euros, and in the United States from 53,000 euros to 64,000 euros, while China dropped from 67,000 euros to 32,000 euros. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/sgbOXPSp4wVLuSzSIK5Atygt7XfxqiISz85gHrFJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1086&quot; height= &quot;723&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/sgbOXPSp4wVLuSzSIK5Atygt7XfxqiISz85gHrFJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250982&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 23, 2023 local time, in Debrecen, Hungary, an electric vehicle battery factory invested by China Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL) is under construction. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The road to sea is long and difficult&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This time the EU imposes restrictions on electric vehicles from China The anti-subsidy investigation launched by automobiles reminds people of the &quot;double-reverse&quot; (anti-dumping and countervailing) investigation conducted by the EU on photovoltaic modules exported from China in 2012. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Kaijun introduced that when China&#39;s photovoltaic industry emerged, it was commonly known as &quot;three heads outside&quot;, that is, raw materials, technology, and markets were all abroad, with China as the main processing place, and it developed from this. China’s photovoltaic industry suffered a huge blow during the “double-reverse” investigation. However, it was also at this stage that China’s photovoltaic industry fully tapped its endogenous power and localized raw materials, technology, and markets. When the “double-reverse” investigation After the investigation was withdrawn, it regained a large market share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development path of the electric vehicle industry is different from that of the photovoltaic industry. China&#39;s electric vehicles originated in the local market and then went abroad after developing to a certain extent. The current market penetration rate of China&#39;s new energy vehicles is about 35%, and there is still a huge domestic market demand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This EU countervailing investigation also sounded the alarm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dan believes that the EU’s launch of a countervailing investigation on electric vehicles from China is a typical trade protectionism and a manifestation of the EU’s double standards. It is completely untenable both legally and morally. Currently, there are huge differences within the EU regarding this anti-subsidy investigation. The political forces within Germany and France both support and oppose it. However, in the current political environment, the supporting forces within Germany and France have the ability to push the EU to launch an investigation and even influence it. Investigation conclusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in addition to facing the obstacles of trade protectionism, Wu Dan believes that factors such as the inconsistency between China&#39;s national automobile standards and international standards, the fact that my country&#39;s new energy vehicle export certification system has not yet been integrated with international standards, and the decline in overseas consumption capacity are all constraints. It has promoted the international development of my country’s new energy vehicles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dan once wrote that at the current stage, the scale of overseas investment and factory establishment by Chinese car companies is far less than that of traditional multinational car manufacturers in developed countries. Chinese car companies want to transform from a traditional trade model to an overseas business development model. Improving the autonomy and brand influence of the supporting supply chain still has to go through a long and difficult process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[恒大财富杜某等涉嫌犯罪人员被采取刑事强制措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256870]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_jpg/Dm1HIR5mtBCpZsNIdQqubPCVicQZnZDBHsmns7gVm9iav5GtKbUibVljN4L3I5fNFCpHzw LxUYWrW5bEH9Kia5nIBw/640?wx_fmt= jpeg&amp;amp;wxfrom=5&amp;amp;wx_lazy=1&amp;amp;wx_co=1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 0.5;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;https://mmbiz.qpic. cn/sz_mmbiz_jpg/Dm1HIR5mtBCpZsNIdQqubPCVicQZnZDBHsmns7gVm9iav5GtKbUibVljN4L3I5fNFCpHzwLxUYWrW5bEH9Kia5nIBw/640?wx_fmt=jpeg&amp;amp;wxfrom=5&amp;amp;wx_lazy=1 &amp;amp;wx_co=1&quot; data-key=&quot;media-1694873788117-0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 23:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[走近霍尔果斯“守关人”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256824]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/FqInwUqfJtlhA5sf3cCHzxzSO15M5p9oKUr1J14C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;539&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/FqInwUqfJtlhA5sf3cCHzxzSO15 M5p9oKUr1J14C. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250554&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Police monitor China-Europe trains leaving the country at night&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 10 o&#39;clock in the evening, the sun has just set, the rails and stones are still hot, and the high temperature emitted by the train engine is uncomfortable.

According to the agreement between China and Kazakhstan, the railway port implemented a 7-day × 12-hour service model at that time, but there were only seven or eight inbound and outbound freight trains every day. Yue Shuang used &quot;boring&quot; to describe the work at that time, &quot;There was not much business volume, but it was very tiring.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change occurred in 2014, when the railway port was officially opened in February of that year. Yue Shuang still remembers that the number of trains that summer more than doubled than before, and the number continued to grow.

The police had to climb into the carriages one by one and check the bottom of the carriages to prevent criminals or prohibited items from hiding in them and illegal entry and exit. It took more than half an hour to inspect a train. Later, they formed a mature inspection process, strengthened technological means, and carried out comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound trains. Now it only takes about 10 minutes to inspect a train. In order to better adapt to the growing demand for customs clearance, the border inspection station has adjusted the railway port to a 365-day × 24-hour service model, so that entry and exit trains can be inspected and released at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1eF7ZbQvGlj1T8fCvN2CBPnzdGYnDZDn2hnXiIRB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1eF7ZbQvGlj1T8fCvN2CBPnzdGYnDZDn2hnXiIRB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250561&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Check the identity of the outbound truck driver&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Spring and Autumn Return Well, the most difficult parts are summer and winter.&quot; Yue Shuang said that the highest temperature in summer at the duty site is over 50 degrees Celsius, eggs can be fried on the railway tracks, and people often faint at the duty site; in winter, the lowest temperature drops to more than 30 degrees below zero. degrees Celsius, when the police inspected the car, their hands were accidentally stuck to the iron sheet of the carriage. If they tore it apart with force, bloody skin and flesh would be left on the carriage. In December 2018, the port encountered a blizzard with more than 70 centimeters of snow. In order not to affect the normal operation of the train, the police cleared the snow all night long. Everyone was covered with thick ice when they returned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To the northwest of the railway port, about two kilometers away in a straight line, stands the sixth-generation national gate that was opened in September 2018.

In his opinion, the design concept of the new national gate is more advanced. Passengers only need to scan their fingerprints and faces to clear customs in just 15 seconds; trucks adopt one-stop inspection and one-time customs clearance to improve customs clearance efficiency. From January 1 to July 21, 2023, the number of entry and exit vehicles at the port exceeded 100,000, exceeding the annual customs clearance volume of highway ports in previous years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many potential changes that cannot be seen at ordinary times.” Zeng Qi said. In the past, export commodities were mainly fruits and vegetables, department stores and various daily necessities, but now they include building materials, machinery and equipment, precision instruments, etc. Among them, Chinese-made new energy vehicles are especially popular with countries along the “Belt and Road”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WKPqmSzsnAkezItMKQ5VwS3AhY40YNpCDOQrwJIm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WKPqmSzsnAkezItMKQ5VwS3AhY40YNpCDOQrwJIm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Vehicles of various types waiting to leave the country in front of the sixth-generation national gate&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What touched Zeng Qi most deeply was one day in May 2023. As he was getting off work, there was still a long queue of vehicles waiting to clear customs. They urgently met and negotiated with the Kazakh border inspection department and obtained the other party&#39;s consent to extend the customs clearance time. When the news came, the drivers waiting for customs clearance in front of the boundary bridge applauded in unison. They worked until about 5 a.m. the next day, and finally completed the inspection and release of all vehicles to be inspected. &quot;Seeing so many Chinese products leaving us, no matter how tiring it is, it&#39;s worth it.&quot; On August 15, 2023, the Horgos Highway Port began to implement 24-hour freight customs clearance on a trial basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is the tenth anniversary of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. With the continuous growth of port customs clearance, more and more tourists are visiting Horgos, and &quot;gold diggers&quot; from various countries are also pouring in. This border town is undergoing rapid changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Shuang once went out of the country to meet with the Kazakh border inspection department, and it was already night when he returned. He stood in the dark wilderness outside the country and looked at Horgos. It was brightly lit and bustling with traffic, making it a veritable &quot;city that never sleeps.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[胡适与吴鼎昌父子刘廷芳兄弟：从吴元黎旧藏《四十自述》说起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256625]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/LL1yxLVpALUNrKyeCE83Pod4zXgpgeFhBJuc4Sss.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;882&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/LL1yxLVpALUNrKyeCE83Pod4zXgpgeFhBJuc4Ss s. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250684&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Shi signed and presented Wu Yuanli&#39;s &quot;Autobiography of Forty&quot;.

There are some old books among them. I chose three to give to you.&quot; He knew that I loved books, so he joked: &quot;A sword is given to a hero.&quot; It happened that a Chinese friend returned to China to visit relatives, and Liu My husband asked her to take it with her and deliver it to me when she got home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a few days, I received three books from Nantong: one was the 1935 edition of Kang Youwei&#39;s &quot;Book of Datong&quot; by Zhonghua Book Company. The front and back covers had fallen off, and the title page had the words &quot;Wu &quot;Huansheng&quot; is printed in white. One is the 1943 edition of Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s &quot;The Destiny of China&quot; by Zhengzhong Bookstore. There is a calligraphy inscription on the title page: &quot;Brother Zhao Jinyong Huicun, brother Liang Kui respectfully presents it.&quot; Zhao Jinyong and Liang Kui were both diplomats during the Republic of China. There is also a 1959 edition of Hu Shi&#39;s &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot; published by Far East Book Company, which is actually signed by Hu Shi. The last invoice was made by Wu Yuanli, Mr. Liu Rongqian&#39;s uncle, and the invoice was signed on May 31, 1960. Inside the book is a copy of Mao Zishui&#39;s &quot;Three Years After the Death of Mr. Hu Shizhi&quot; published in the third issue of Volume 6 of &quot;Biographical Literature&quot;. This was beyond my expectation. I have been thinking about Hu Shi’s autographed book for a long time, but I didn’t expect that it was Mr. Liu Rongqian who helped me realize my dream. These three books were all collected by Wu Yuanli. Mr. Liu Rongqian told me that after his uncle (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Yuanli) passed away in the United States, he went to California to help his cousin deal with his uncle&#39;s belongings and asked for it from his cousin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Check the &quot;First Draft of the Long Chronicle of Mr. Hu Shizhi&quot; (Supplementary Edition) compiled by Hu Songping. It says on June 1, 1960: &quot;Wu Yuanli and Liu Tingwei came to see him. Yuanli was Wu Dingchang (Da). (Quan)’s son, let’s talk about Wu Tat-quan’s autobiography &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot;.&quot; It can be seen that Hu Shi prepared the book a day in advance, and the gift of &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot; was also a thoughtful and meaningful move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi and Wu Yuanli did not have a close relationship and may have only met once or twice. On June 19, 1949, they met in the United States. Hu Shi did not have too many records in his diary. He only wrote: &quot;5:30 &amp;nbsp;Mr. Wu (Son of Da Quan).&quot; At this time, the Nationalist Government had withdrawn from Nanjing and Hu Shi arrived in the United States. On June 21, Hu Shi telegraphed his resignation as Foreign Minister to the new Executive Yuan Yan Xishan, who was retreating to Guangzhou. But Hu Shi should have heard about Wu Yuanli&#39;s deeds. On the morning of July 1, 1959, he attended the fourth academician meeting of Academia Sinica and served as the chairman of the meeting. At the meeting, Jiang Shuojie reported on the research status of Chinese economists in the United States and mentioned many talents in economics, including Wu Yuanli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQukqc6kLu6aOF9pBLBRSMm3uroyeMm8Jxnk6R1u.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height= &quot;1028&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQukqc6kLu6aOF9pBLBRSMm3uroyeMm8Jxnk6R1u.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250679&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Dingchang (back row, right), Chen Shiyun (middle seat) and his wife take a photo with their daughter Wu Yuanjun (back row, left), son-in-law Liu Tingwei (back row, center), and son Wu Yuanli (front row, right) . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yuanli was born in Shanghai in 1920. He studied at Shanghai Nanyang Middle School and St. John&#39;s University in his early years, and later went to England for further study. In 1942, he received a first-class honors degree in economics from the University of London. In 1946, he received a doctorate in economics and was a disciple of Hayek. After returning to China, he served in the Central Bank. In 1949, he moved to the United States and became a professor in the Department of Economics at the University of San Francisco. Chen Yuxian divided the Chinese experts who studied Sinology in North America into five major groups. The second group was &quot;around the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. A group of scholars who studied or taught in church universities migrated to North America. They encountered the expansion of North American institutions of higher learning after World War II.&quot; Soon, they became fluent in both Chinese and English and settled in various universities, becoming the backbone of Chinese studies in each school.&quot; Wu Yuanli is the leader in this second group. Since 1960, Wu Yuanli has served as a researcher and consultant at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University. He used the rich collections of the Hoover Library to write books such as &quot;Overseas Chinese and the Economic Development of Southeast Asia&quot;, &quot;The Role of the Chinese in the Economic Development of Southeast Asia&quot; and &quot;Taiwan: Towards an Industrialized Society&quot;. Precisely because of Wu Yuanli&#39;s superb research on China issues, he served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense of the United States from 1969 to 1970. In 1985, Wu Yuanli won the Humboldt Foundation Research Award in Germany. In November 2008, Wu Yuanli accidentally fell and caused intracranial hemorrhage. He died at Stanford University Hospital in California on the 18th at the age of 88. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/3BQKBU2VVI5x5r8qEWYPN7BSq3FboPaO0bFfSg1A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1104&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/3BQKBU2VVI5x5r8qEWYPN7BSq3FboPaO0bFfSg1A.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250683&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A group photo of Wu and Liu families.

He said that when he was a child, he lived with his grandparents in Guiyang (Editor&#39;s note: referring to Wu Dingchang and his wife, Wu was the chairman of Guizhou Province at the time). One day the postman delivered a silver-gray box with a piece of coffee cake and a lot of dried fruits. His grandmother told him this It was sent from London by my uncle, and I still haven&#39;t forgotten the sweet taste. After the war of resistance against Japan was over in Nanjing, his uncle brought back his aunt with blue eyes and blond hair. This was the first time he saw his uncle and the first time he talked directly to &quot;foreigners&quot;. He felt strange. Later, his uncle went to the United States, and his family went to live in Taiwan. In 1962, my grandmother passed away, and my uncle returned to Taiwan to attend the funeral. In 1965, he was studying in Paris. His uncle and aunt came to see him. They saw that he was studying design during the day and working in a hotel at night. His life was difficult. His uncle suggested that he go to the United States to study economics instead. It would be easier to find a job after graduation and it would also help He lends a helping hand. He answered his uncle: &quot;I can only draw.&quot; In 1965, Liu Rongqian immigrated to Canada. A few years later, he brought his parents to live in Canada. His uncle would come to visit relatives every year. After Mr. Liu&#39;s parents passed away, he often visited his uncle in California, chatted with him, and discussed the foundation to commemorate Wu Chen Shiyun (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Dingchang&#39;s wife). When his uncle passed away, he was in Beijing and did not have time to attend the funeral. Later, he went to California to help his cousin, who did not understand Chinese, organize a house full of Chinese books and materials. Mr. Liu said that his uncle kept a low profile throughout his life, moved and spoke softly, was good at listening and asking questions, and was very caring about his younger generations. &quot;Perhaps my uncle studied in England when he was young and was influenced by the British&#39;s cold humor. He would often make people laugh unexpectedly during conversations. I remember that in Paris that year, we were sitting in an outdoor cafe. He said that Paris was very interesting. Half of the Parisians were sitting there. Watching the other half of Paris in a cafe. If I could describe my impression of my uncle in one sentence: he is a gentleman with a sense of humor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi and Wu Yuanli&#39;s father, Wu Dingchang, are old acquaintances and spoke highly of him. On February 26, 1931, Cao Heheng invited Ke Shaobin, Zheng Xiaoxu, Jiang Han, Yang Zhongxi and others to have dinner together. He also invited Wu Dingchang and Hu Shi. This was the first time they met. Hu Shi&#39;s diary recorded on that day: &quot;Wu Jun is a capable man. I have wanted to see him for a long time, but I have disagreed many times. Today I met him for the first time.&quot; Wu Dingchang is seven or eight years older than Hu Shi. He is an industrialist and banker and has served as the Bank of China. President, General Manager of Salt Bank, and Deputy Minister of Finance of the Beijing Government. Later, he acquired &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; and appointed himself as president. He invited Hu Zhengzhi as general manager and Zhang Jiluan as editor-in-chief, giving &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; a new life and becoming one of the most influential newspapers in the country. Therefore, Hu Shi was left with a &quot;competent&quot; impression. In November of that year, the Nanjing National Government established a Finance Committee, with Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang as members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gvp2av25spnjzLea2PNQn5ygS6DkCvKHe2kwJAk4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;479&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gvp2av25spnjzLea2PNQn5ygS6DkCvKHe2kwJAk4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250682&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Tingwei and Wu Yuanjun wedding photos. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Liu Rongqian)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 11, 1933, on the eve of Hu Shi’s visit to the United States, he passed through Tianjin. Wu Dingchang went to visit specifically. They &quot;talked for more than two o&#39;clock&quot;, and Wu Dingchang &quot;advocated &#39;returning power to the people&#39; the most vigorously, and also advocated the temporary suspension of many construction projects.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 31, 1934, Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang met at Wang Jingwei&#39;s official residence in Nanjing. Also present were Zhang Jiluan, Ren Hongjun, Chen Hengzhe, Tang Youren, Zeng Zhongming, etc. They discussed foreign and domestic issues. . The meaning is still not finished. After leaving, Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang talked late at night when they returned to their apartment. At that time, Sino-Japanese relations were becoming increasingly tense, and there were many different voices regarding foreign and domestic policies. Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang obviously had different opinions, but this did not affect Hu Shi&#39;s good impression of Wu Dingchang. In July of that year, Hu Shi wrote &quot;From Private School to Yenching University&quot;. When talking about private donations to build schools, he cited the example of Wu Dingchang: &quot;Those with more money can renovate a university. ... Those with less money can also subsidize a specific school.&quot; A certain part, such as Mr. Wu Dingchang’s donation to the Department of Economics of Nankai University for student aid. In this way, a small amount can add up to a large amount, making the already successful school become even more successful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi, Wu Yuanli and Liu Tingwei The &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot; mentioned was written by Wu Dingchang when he was the chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government. It was published by Guizhou Daily in October 1940. It has &quot;when taking office&quot;, &quot;after taking office&quot;, &quot;province&quot; and &quot;county&quot;. There are seven chapters in &quot;Central Administration and Local Governments&quot;, &quot;Miscellaneous Thoughts&quot; and &quot;Postscript&quot;. Three years later, Hu Zhengzhi persuaded Wu Dingchang to continue writing &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot;, so there were nine chapters in the &quot;Continuation&quot;, namely &quot;Provincial Government&quot;, &quot;Counties and Towns&quot;, &quot;New County System&quot;, &quot;Counties and Townships&quot;, &quot;New Life&quot;, &quot;Public Security and Gangs&quot;, &quot;Economy and Control&quot;, &quot;Finance and Accounting&quot; and &quot;Miscellaneous Feelings&quot; were published by Guizhou Enterprise Co., Ltd. Printing Office in October 1943. Wu Dingchang ran a newspaper, and it is said that his poetry and prose were very good. Cao Juren said: &quot;I read the sequel to his &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot; and liked his simplicity and closeness. His female son-in-law collected his poems and distributed them to the best. After reading them, I felt that there were no empty scholars in his name. After leaving Guizhou, Wu Dingchang served as the civil servant of the National Government, Secretary-General of the Central Design Bureau of the Kuomintang, and Secretary-General of the Presidential Office. He once suggested to Chiang Kai-shek that he invite Mao Zedong to Chongqing for negotiations. In January 1949, retired Wu Dingchang came to live in Hong Kong at the urging of his son. On August 22, 1950, Wu Dingchang died of cancer in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WrMFUIDTySoVmp3a1GM2tmUVYsCQiSp4eHl8e3wK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; height= &quot;927&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WrMFUIDTySoVmp3a1GM2tmUVYsCQiSp4eHl8e3wK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250681&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Brothers Liu Tingfang (left) and Liu Tingwei (right). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Liu Rongqian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Tingwei, who went to visit Hu Shi with Wu Yuanli, was not introduced in Hu Shi&#39;s diary. Liu Tingwei is the son-in-law of Wu Dingchang and the father of Mr. Liu Rongqian. He was born in 1903 and was a native of Wenzhou, Zhejiang. After graduating from Yanjing University, he studied at Cornell University in the United States and received a doctorate in entomology. After completing his studies, he returned to China and served successively as professor in the Department of Biology of Hujiang University, technical director of the Nanjing Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, technical director of the Guizhou Work Station of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, and technical director of the Agricultural Group of the Agricultural Society. After the Agricultural Restoration Association moved to Taiwan in 1949, Liu Tingwei served as the leader of the first group and later the plant production group until his retirement in 1965. Liu Tingwei is also a poet. His poems are highly praised by Tao Xingzhi, Xu Zhimo and Shen Congwen. He has published poetry collections &quot;Mountain Flowers&quot; and &quot;My Cup&quot;. His wife, Wu Yuanjun, was the eldest daughter of Wu Dingchang. She was born in 1912. She studied at Yenching University and was a classmate of Zhou Yiliang. She was quite talented and assisted Rong Geng in editing the &quot;Continuation of Bronze Inscriptions&quot; when they were in school. The daughter Cao Juren mentioned was Wu Yuanjun who printed a collection of poems for Wu Dingchang. Liu Tingwei and Wu Yuanjun got married in July 1933 and stayed together for the rest of their lives. In their later years, they lived with their children in Canada and the United States. In January 1994, Liu Tingwei passed away in Canada. In December 2001, Wu Yuanjun passed away in the United States. Both lived into their nineties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi has no direct interaction with Liu Tingwei, but he is very familiar with his eldest brother Liu Tingfang. When Liu Tingfang was a teenager, he was highly appreciated by Su Huilian, Cai Bomin, Stuart Leighton and others. Stuart recommended him to study at St. John&#39;s University in Shanghai, and later arranged for him to study in the United States. Liu Tingfang received a bachelor&#39;s degree and a master&#39;s degree from Columbia University in the United States, a bachelor&#39;s degree in divinity from Yale Divinity School, and a doctorate in educational psychology from Columbia University. After returning to China, he worked at Yenching University with Leighton Stuart and was an important assistant to Leighton Stuart in starting the cause of Yenching University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/kzPxt48fnGol2uq1muiA1nHoLJfOKkF0tqevZMwr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height= &quot;815&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/kzPxt48fnGol2uq1muiA1nHoLJfOKkF0tqevZMwr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250680&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Yuanli in his later years. In the 1940s, Wu Yuanli advocated giving rights to the poor and allowing them to develop freely. Another famous economist, Fang Xianting, advocated relying on elite planning to develop the economy and letting the elites make decisions for the poor. The debate between the two ended with Fang Xianting gaining the upper hand. Wu Yuanli retreated to the United States, and his name was gradually forgotten. It was not until 2007 that American historian of economic thought Paul Trescott rediscovered Wu Yuanli and believed that the Wu Fang debate was the earliest debate in the history of development economics. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest record about Liu Tingfang in Hu Shi&#39;s diary was on April 28, 1921: &quot;Went to Liu Tingfang&#39;s house for dinner. Liu Jun is in charge of religious studies, and his family has many books on religious history.&quot; On May 18 of the same year: &quot;In the morning, Mr. Stuart, Pastor Liu Tingfang and Mr. Huo Jinde came to talk.&quot; On June 30 of the same year, Peking University, the Men&#39;s and Women&#39;s Normal Schools, the Shangzhi Society, the New Society, etc. held a farewell party for the Dewey family at Jinyuxuan in Central Park. Hu Shi, Liu Tingfang, and Wu Zhuosheng were all there. Hu Shi, representing Peking University, translated it into Chinese and spoke it again. Wu Zhuosheng delivered a speech on behalf of the Women&#39;s Normal University, which was translated into Chinese by Liu Tingfang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1921, Yenching University wanted to improve the Department of Chinese Language and Culture. Stuart Leighton and Liu Tingfang invited Hu Shi to take charge of the work, but Hu Shi did not agree and recommended Zhou Zuoren instead. He thought it was a pity that Zhou Zuoren could not use his talents at Peking University, so he asked him to &quot;go out and do his own thing.&quot; Unfortunately, Zhou became ill, so the matter was put on hold for a year. The next year, Yanjing brought up the matter again, so on March 4, 1922, Hu Shi invited Stuart Leighton, Liu Tingfang, and Zhou Zuoren to introduce them and let them talk face to face. Hu Shi recorded in his diary: &quot;They were very satisfied with their discussion.&quot; Zhou Zuoren taught at Yan University for more than ten years until he was hired as a research professor by Peking University and could not take courses at other schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 11, 1937, Hu Shi &quot;went to eat at Liu Tingfang of Yan University.&quot; Since then, Liu Tingfang has not appeared in Hu Shi&#39;s diary. Liu Tingfang was later elected as a legislator, but due to poor health, he went to the United States for medical treatment in 1942. He died in a Presbyterian Hospital in New Mexico in 1947 at the age of fifty-six. I wonder if Hu Shi thought of his brother Liu Tingfang when he met Liu Tingwei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu Rongqian currently lives in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and has been inviting me to visit him. &quot;Don&#39;t forget that at my age, I&#39;m already counting down the days. Please make the trip as soon as possible.&quot; But I thought, he should go home as soon as possible while he can still move around. Liu Rongqian has lived overseas for a long time and has never been to his hometown of Wenzhou. In May 2015, he held the &quot;Unintentional Realm&quot; photography art exhibition in Hangzhou. I went to observe and learn from it, and took a quick look. Fortunately, there is WeChat, so we can communicate online at any time after we are separated. That was the closest Mr. Liu Rongqian was to his hometown. A few months ago, Professor Shen Weiwei of Nanjing University came to Wenzhou University to give a lecture and asked me to accompany him to look for Liu Tingfang’s old traces. That area is undergoing renovation of a historical district, and the small bungalow Liu Tingfang built for his mother after returning to China is no longer accessible. Professor Shen saw a corner of Liu&#39;s former residence through the bathroom window of an office building. Therefore, please Mr. Liu Rongqian &quot;make the trip as soon as possible&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贵州省委政法委原副书记刘文新被“双开”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256866]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision: Recently, with the approval of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee, the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision Liu Wenxin, former deputy secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, has been investigated for serious violations of discipline and law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, Liu Wenxin lost his ideals and beliefs, abandoned his duties and missions, alienated the party and the people, went his own way, acted arbitrarily and illegally, engaged in &quot;seven things&quot;, and became a destroyer of the political ecology and economic order. ; Being disloyal and dishonest to the Party, being two-faced, resisting organizational censorship, engaging in feudal superstitious activities, privately possessing and reading books and periodicals with serious political issues; Ignoring the spirit of the eight central regulations, accepting violations that may affect the fair execution of official duties Arrange banquets, travel and activities, violate the work and life security system, seek special treatment, advocate hedonism, fly first class in violation of regulations; have no organizational principles, fail to truthfully explain problems when organizing conversations, fail to truthfully report major personal matters, violate regulations Transferring work for others; losing integrity, accepting gifts and money in violation of regulations, having bad morals, living an extremely corrupt life, engaging in power, sex, and money transactions, having long-term improper sexual relations with others, whoring, gambling; playing with things, being obsessed with knives; violating regulations Allocating fees to enterprises, intervening in violation of regulations and intervening in judicial activities.

Although the Serbian team failed to win the final victory in the decisive battle, in this World Cup they made it all the way to the final in the absence of several top stars, which once again proved the amazing strength of this veteran European team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some are happy and some are sad. The Chinese men’s basketball team ranked only 29th among the 32 participating teams. The coach is Alexander Djordje, the famous coach who holds the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Serbian Basketball Coaches Association. Vicky, for him and the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team, the trip to the Philippines World Cup was full of frustration and depression. The Chinese men&#39;s basketball team lost to Serbia 63-105 in the first game of the World Cup. This day happened to be Lao Qiao&#39;s 56th birthday. Before the game, many members of the Serbian team sent blessings to the legend, but after the game started, the birthday boy could only shake his head. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 16, 2022, the Chinese Basketball Association made adjustments to the head coach of the Chinese Men’s Basketball National Team and announced the selection of Djordjevic as the head coach of the Chinese Men’s Basketball National Team. His task is to lead the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team in the sixth window of the 2023 Men&#39;s Basketball World Cup qualifying period and the 2023 Men&#39;s Basketball World Cup, striving to lead the team to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese men’s basketball team spent a lot of money to hire a world-class coach to lead the army, and naturalized NBA star Kyle Lee joined the team. The largest investment in the history of the Chinese men’s basketball team resulted in one win and four losses in this World Cup, setting the worst record in history. At the same time, he lost his Olympic ticket again and fell into the abyss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese men’s basketball team performed poorly in the last Olympic cycle and failed to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. This time it failed to qualify for the Paris Olympics, which means that a generation of players cannot participate in the highest level during their golden period of competition. competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, when participating in the Olympic Games, the flag bearer of the Chinese delegation would be a tall and handsome Chinese men&#39;s basketball star. Now, the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team, which has missed two consecutive Olympics, has even lost a standard-bearer who can guide the direction - veteran Yi Jianlian, who was unable to go with the team, announced his retirement before the last game of the Chinese men&#39;s basketball group stage. Fans lamented that since before the Olympics, Without being able to compete for eight to eight years, the glory of the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team has completely faded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How should the Chinese men’s basketball team move forward? &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; conducted an exclusive interview with Gong Luming, the famous Chinese basketball coach. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, at the age of 39, he directed the Chinese team to reach the top eight in the Olympics for the first time. This is the best record that has not been broken so far. This group of players is also known as the &quot;96 Golden Generation&quot;. When the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team hit a trough in 2014, he was asked to come out. A year later, he once again brought the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team back to the top in Asia. This legendary guard, who is only 1.72 meters tall, is known as the &quot;fire-fighting master&quot; of Chinese basketball. In 1999, he became the head coach at the lowest point when the Chinese women&#39;s basketball team lost the qualification to compete in the Sydney Olympics. Through major changes and all-round team building, he created a young and brave golden generation of women&#39;s basketball, winning the 2001 Asian Women&#39;s Basketball Championship and the 2001 Women&#39;s Basketball Asian Championship. He won two titles at the 2002 Asian Games and finished sixth at the 2002 World Championships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is the self-report of coach Gong Luming:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; I personally strongly agree with the strengthening of international exchanges in Chinese basketball. It is a good thing for the Chinese Basketball Association to hire foreign coaches, especially famous foreign coaches. They can bring us a lot of good experience in terms of confrontation, concepts, and methods. . However, some practical factors must be taken into consideration on how to properly coordinate the coaching team and how to give full play to the role of foreign teachers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The specialty of foreign coaches is high professionalism, concentration and seriousness, and their coaching level is also certain He was selected by the Chinese Basketball Association only after he has reached a certain height. There is no doubt about this. Most of them grew up in a highly professional basketball environment and believe that everyone in the team, including themselves, has sufficient professionalism. After assembling a national team, foreign teachers rarely think that the construction and management of the team and the improvement of athletes&#39; skills are also one of the priorities of the head coach. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;They are more accustomed to focusing on the court, such as the tactical system, lineup configuration, and opponents. Research, etc., and many other things, he will think that it is your athlete&#39;s own business, or that a mature professional athlete should have solved the problem long ago. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When foreign teachers serve as head coaches, although they will be equipped with excellent Chinese coaches as assistants, the basic Foreign head coaches rarely have in-depth and active communication with Chinese coaches. To be honest, they may not necessarily like our Chinese coaches, so we will see that the foreign head coaches are very dedicated and very courageous to carry out their work, but there are very few opportunities for Chinese and foreign coaches to formally exchange opinions or communicate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From our past experience, if a foreign teacher serves as an assistant coach, he will actively communicate with the head coach To communicate, he will actively communicate with the Chinese coaching staff the various information he has seen and collected, as well as how to deal with it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Over the years, whether it is the national team or local clubs, our basketball world has formed such a The coaching environment: Unless the Chinese coach is very proactive and actively cooperates with the foreign teacher and asks the foreign teacher for advice, he may talk more to the Chinese coach. If you don&#39;t do this and you just follow the foreign teacher, he will not actually give you any help. But if the Chinese side is the head coach, the foreign teacher will actively communicate with you about his experience, knowledge or methods. This is a very realistic thing. Such a coaching culture has been formed over the years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Another point is that even if there are no foreign teachers, the coaching staff is all local coaches. There is also an unwritten rule. I am used to following the arrangements of the head coach. To put it simply, if you don’t arrange things, I won’t do it. If the head coach has spoken and arranged for me, I will do it. If the head coach does not ask for it, then the assistant coach will not express his opinion easily. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;These are our &quot;basketball culture&quot;. When hiring foreign teachers, you must consider these practical factors. In fact, it is very difficult. There has been a consensus within the circle for a long time that foreign teachers can be used and the ball can be lost, but the initiative must be in our own hands. Even if we lose, we must let our own coaches know how to lose. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/O4yeTzwTaxr80Zv1c1vc6sHZGmgOxdACXvM7x0pw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/O4yeTzwTaxr80Zv1c1vc6sHZGmgOxdACXvM7x0pw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250580&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2015, in Changsha, Hunan, the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team won the 2015 Asian Men&#39;s Basketball Championship.

Can foreign teachers really save Chinese basketball? not necessarily! To this day, the best record in the history of China&#39;s men&#39;s and women&#39;s basketball teams is still led by our own local coaches.

A person&#39;s mind is not that simple. Why do you play basketball? What basic quality requirements does this profession require of you? Going a step further, what is your specific understanding of the era you live in? What requirements does this specific background of the times place on yourself and the sports industry?

Hearing people criticize the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team for &quot;male football&quot; brings disgrace to our work in basketball and football.

Need aesthetic education?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250958&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Works by Guinan School students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Independent artist and curator Guan Yong is in his forties, has a tall figure and likes to wear Straw sandals. He has been engaged in art education since he was nineteen years old, working in kindergartens, primary schools, and art galleries in Zhuhai, Guangzhou, Macau and other places. Later, he also participated in this miniature rural aesthetic education experiment as an art director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, Guinan School had more than 40 classes, more than 1,700 students, and 3 art teachers, but there was no art classroom. In July 2018, Guinan School converted six classrooms on the first floor into art classrooms. Now, the school has eight full-time art teachers, four studios and a reading room. The teaching content involves traditional Chinese painting, printmaking, pottery, paper-cutting, etc. Guinan&#39;s campus also has a miniature art gallery that displays students&#39; works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When visiting this place, Southern Weekend reporters were surprised by the art works hidden on campus. These works are displayed all over the campus. A large number of clay sculptures are dried on the ground, prints are posted on the walls, installation art is hung in the corridors, and handmade works are posted under the eaves. These works are quite childish, and the largest number are clay sculptures, including cups, plates, bottles, jars, and various clay figures with strange shapes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Up3LZQx8CNfkgURkqUALPuYpCgqb4Tv173RGEIYA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Up3LZQx8CNfkgURkqUALPuYpCgqb4Tv173RGEIYA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250959&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Student art works in the corridor of the teaching building of Guinan School. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the comprehensive studio, weaving, sewing, embroidery and other handicrafts are completed here; folk crafts The studio is for students; the folk art room is filled with students’ prints, paper-cuts, etc.; in the comprehensive painting studio, you can see Chinese paintings, watercolors, oil paintings and other works by students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/K4RhNWazPNxMQUDqRo9O4X3j0zIZBlSXxoWguIr8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/K4RhNWazPNxMQUDqRo9O4X3j0zIZBlSXxoWguIr8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250963&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Student prints from Guinan School. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you travel through the countryside, you can also see the works of students. &quot;Children&#39;s things are natural things.&quot; Zhang Yaoren pointed to the student works along the country road and said, &quot;(In the past) many paintings on the walls were relatively stiff.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, Guan Yong and others started a rural teacher program to provide teaching support to front-line teachers from rural areas and plan to complete the training of one thousand teachers within two years. Zhang Yaoren said: &quot;We do the Thousand Talents Plan precisely because we believe that (aesthetic education) is the most important thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;If you have never done carpentry, you will do carpentry, and if you have never played in mud, you will play in mud.&quot;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;Local children mostly choose to go to public schools in towns. The students recruited by Guinan School are basically the children of migrant workers. Most of these students come from Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui and other places. Their parents left their hometown and came to the Pearl River Delta. While the students are in class, their parents sell things at nearby markets, work in factories, and do odd jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaoren recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that students would leave every semester. The fathers left the worksite, and the children flew away like birds. Academic performance has nothing to do with art. Zhang Yaoren said that they did not disclose the idea of ​​​​art courses to the parents of the students. He understands the parents’ thinking. Art is useless. It’s better to do more questions: “The parents must have said that my son only scored 85 points in math. Can you not let him attend the 90 minutes of art class? He might get 90 points in the exam. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Yong has a point of view. Regarding the curriculum, the art textbooks compiled by the state are always the basis, accounting for 70% of the curriculum. The remaining 30% is carried out by the teaching team for outreach and expansion. The content of the 18 textbooks for grades one to nine was broken up and reconnected with the four studios. As the grades increase, the content offered by each studio becomes deeper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/yPaKd9OGAQgZTSxdq2wI90zCjjZziTskqh66IZUd.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;提高教师的审美和教学能力是关键。五年前，桂南学校仅有两位美术老师，学生们上课便是拿出A4纸勾画。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“（乡村美术老师）他们的专业度上是不深的，国美、央美毕业的老师怎么会来我们这边？在老师的专业水平没那么高的情况下，怎么可以提升他们的水平？”张耀仁对南方周末记者说，“干活，教你方法，你没干过木工就干木工，没玩过泥巴就玩泥巴。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关勇等人更愿意把进课堂称之为进工作室，他们认为艺术是成人世界的词汇，而儿童基础美术教育是“启蒙学生的创意和自我表达”，更像是“一个艺术性的工作”。少谈美术理论，碰到问题，关勇总说“动起来”。没美术基础怎么办？关勇说，那就干活！干着干着，手上就有了感觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;桂南学校没有额外增加美术课的时间，当然也不允许抢占美术课的时间，学生一周要完成一次九十分钟的课程。四十分钟的美术课根本不足以让孩子们“尽兴”。课程的开端，总有一个欣赏环节。老师将课程相关的图拿来给孩子“看”。九年的时间，学生可以看上万张图，这些图片成为他们审美的来源之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如，二年级的课程《剪纸——变身记》，学生需要学习折纸、装订、剪、拼贴头部，观看黄永玉、小松美羽、韩美林等人的作品；五年级第一学期的九十分钟课，课题为《套色吹塑版画——瓶花》，授课内容包括刻轮廓线、刻花纹，观看的资料包括戴维茨、梵高、马蒂斯的作品等；九年级的课程《综合版画——面具》，学生要学习刻亮度和刻灰度，观看顾恺之、吴道子、张萱的作品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作室里有各种设备，包括价值昂贵的版画机，还有各种绘画工具，胶枪、锯子等。据统计，纸张便有三十多种。这些材料来自桂南学校支出。张耀仁说，学校方面付出了很大的努力&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Q4vVA4zYwX0QyIXfpOnDVbYEIDsoi3KyR1mlocmq.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;桂南学校的美术工作室，抽屉里放满了各种不同材质的纸张。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，并不是每个学校都有足够的材料经费。一些材料同样来自土地。美术老师带着学生们收集树叶、泥土、废弃纸张、旧衣服、塑料瓶等。每一个学期，桂南的孩子们会消耗掉成吨的泥土。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;美术老师干成了主科学科带头人&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;张耀仁曾走访过粤西的一些乡村学校，这些学校的留守儿童比例占到了六成以上。在某个镇的中心小学，仅有180个学生。 “撤点并校”的背景下，网易数读的数据显示，从1976年到2016年的四十年间，有91.6万所小学在中国消失，而其中消失的基本都是农村小学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位参与培训的美术老师向南方周末记者印证了这个说法。一位湖南衡阳的乡村教师不无伤感对南方周末记者说，她所在的乡村小学，下学期将要合并了。她从外地匆匆赶来，心里带着莫大的期待，想为村里的孩子带来新的东西。工作四年，她看着学生从一百多个减少到三十多个。她有些羡慕体育课，校园足球教育是衡阳特色，几乎每个小学都配备足球场并保证体育课时。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;浙江致朴公益基金会的负责人骆筱红，人们称她为“花布”，多年来关注乡村儿童生命成长和困境儿童心理健康，她告诉南方周末记者，六年之前，在山区某县，全部乡村20所乡村小学，只有一个专职美术老师，这些年已经有了一些好转，但是仍然存在问题亟待解决。比如，在200个学生以下的学校有13个编制，“这显然（排课）怎么排都排不过来”，“巧妇难为无米之炊”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乡村学校，“一个老师掰开好多个人来用”。 “我现在是负责带一年级的班主任，负责阅读课，劳技课，还要负责我们学校的品宣等。”一位老师向南方周末记者列举。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;走访乡村学校的时候，张耀仁发现：师范美术学校毕业的老师，有的十几年来在教主科，没有再教美术，而原本语文、数学等学科的老师，反而兼职教美术、音乐等课程。一些原本的美术老师甚至成了主科的学科带头人，聊起来“心底总有一些遗憾”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年，中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅印发《关于全面加强和改进新时代学校美育工作的意见》。意见提出，要把美育纳入各级各类学校人才培养全过程，贯穿学校教育各学段。一位来自湘西的公立小学的80后老师，是当地第二批美术特长生。执教十三年，语数外教了个遍。近两年，学校响应美育政策，她得以重回本行转为专职美术老师，弥补当时遗憾：“美术不是没有门槛，是因为他们觉得教得不好没有关系，不会造成后果。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美术教育始终被认为是“副科”。在很多时候，副科的课时常被主科“侵占”，尤其是教育资源匮乏的小学，主科老师兼任副科老师的情况较为常见，侵占副科课时，更是“水到渠成”。 “国家层面发了许多关于美育的文件，不可谓不重视。美术老师喜欢上美术课，学生也爱上美术课，但是很多情况下却没有上成美术课。”骆筱红感到心痛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;排课另有玄机，按照正常排课，比如一个语文老师十二节课，使用的是原本的语文课时；但在实际操作中，给语文老师排六节语文课，剩下六节换成美术、体育等课程，自然所有的“副科”都上成语文课。据骆筱红在浙江两个县的观察情况来看，这两年“两张课表”的情况有加剧的趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位民办小学美术老师来自云南大理某县城，所教的村小有250个学生。她告诉南方周末记者，来到桂南学校，似乎一下子找到了同行者。比如，两者都选择两个课时组成一节大课。她所在的学校不会占用美术时间，但是在隔壁的公立小学，情况完全不一样，“现在都要考试，课时又不够，老师为了出成绩（只能这么做）”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“我二十年前画的东西，你们还在画”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者在授课现场看到，来培训的美术老师在工作室经历了桂南课堂的美育内容：了解材料-获取材料-制作-老师点评。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乡村老师的水平显然不一。第一节实践课涉及手工制书，老师大多顺利完成了作品。而在第二节的水墨画课上，老师的水墨作品质量便呈现出一定的差异性。一些老师一边创作，一边对南方周末记者说，实际上，他们已经很多年没有真正碰水墨了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按照关勇的要求，一位陕西安康的美术老师使用了三种不同的纸，感受水墨。他不由念起课堂上的学生们，每人发一支毛笔，每人倒一点点墨，让他们在纸箱子上、A4纸上来涂抹，这是他能带学生感受水墨的最大努力了。如果是手工课，也许剪纸最为简单和方便。多位老师告诉南方周末记者，目前主要的授课形式就是图画课。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乡村资源困顿的现实仍然存在。一位湖南怀化的美术老师说，学校的资源匮乏，一些美术课的材料甚至需要自己掏腰包去购买，前后花了差不多两万块，“实在是干不了，教室是空的，什么也没有，画板也没有，怎么教？”张耀仁说，他接触到的学校，学生需要自备材料，如果家庭无法提供，那课程很难进行下去。 “材料之痛，是美术课程的一个无处遁形的伤疤”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Hj47ESMSaP91n0rp7AvckUqLyRfBjsQmFyoeVrM1.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;上述来自云南的乡村老师表示，一些教学内容涉及高楼大厦、斑马线等，有的乡村孩子从没出过村子，只在电视中见过。 “既然高楼大厦画的是线条和方块，我们就转化内容，考虑怎么回到教学目标”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aq5KSZquk7pNJuHuzUjJUZccQX7cQXqiurpR8NNH.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;桂南学校美术工作室用学生剪纸作业装饰墙壁。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方周末记者张锐/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乡村学校，有一间美术教室或许都是奢望。一位来自陕西的美术老师想起刚刚来学校的时候，校长对他说，全校的美术老师就只有你一个人了，“随便上”。他感到肩膀一沉，但很快，他意识到，这也许意味着远离各种评比和荣誉。 . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;培训计划并不拒绝城市的美术老师，也许他们的学校资源优渥，但在教学方法上仍有困惑。一位来自北京海淀区的年轻老师提问，课本内容有些统一的要求创新，例如，让学生去在三角形中涂色，教师所做的有限。关勇反问道，你为什么不把三角形做大呢？为什么不设计一个巨型三角形，让学生自由涂色？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位90后老师恍然。他出身于师范类美术教育专业，如今在海淀某重点小学授课，负责四年级到六年级的课程。据他说，无论是课时、资源都充沛，也无乡村教师的兼任困扰。学校的美术老师均受过非常好的专业美术训练。 “美术老师的压力来自于&#39;听课评课&#39;的常态化。”上述年轻老师说，另一个困扰是一周两节课往往间隔几天，加上教材的内容琐碎，学生的学习不够系统。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看过作品后，他评价“这边的孩子（比北京的孩子）做得更活一些”。与许多乡村老师初见校园的惊喜不同，他感受更多的不是美术本身，而是美术之外的东西。现场，一位老师提问，是否应该为孩子进行示范，这是过往多年来的教学模式之一。关勇制止了她。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广州天河区城中村的一位美术老师告诉南方周末记者，自己是美术专业出身，从来都是按照标准绘画，学习绘画的公式，画画的时候考虑最多的是公式，而非表达情感。她指着墙上学生的作品说，“第一感觉是非常自由，独一无二”。她想起自己的孩子在区前十的中学上学，参与学校的兴趣班，结果学习的内容和模式和自己小时候毫无差别，“我二十年前画的东西，你们还在画”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;美术是一把盐&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;桂南没有内部的评比活动，也很少参加外围的美术比赛。张耀仁解释说，美术作品的核心是自我表达，表达内心的感受，这怎么能够评分呢？而且观察那些比赛中的作品，往往能看到老师干预的痕迹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几年前，张耀仁要设计一个标识。在民间工作室，他看到一张猴子式样的版画。这张版画后来成为标识。按照收藏的标准，关勇特地制作了漂亮的收藏证书，上面有作者名字和作品名，在升国旗仪式时颁发证书给孩子，并给予奖金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;桂南学校举办乡村儿童艺术双年展时，美国宾夕法尼亚大学的一位学生，研究建立了一个数据模型，分析艺术教育对外来务工子女的影响。第一轮的效果分析出来后，得到一个正向性的结论。张耀仁不太愿意将结果功利化和数据化，用以论证美术和学习成绩之间的关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他常说，美术就是一把盐，生活需要一点调味品。至于美育的势能和影响，张耀仁不考虑这些，也不在意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美术始终要落在教育，而非作品上。学校老师有学生作品观察,老师观察和记录学生课堂的行为、习惯、情绪等。比如一本《期末总结美术课堂观察日记》上，写于2020-2021学年第二学期的观察日记，每一位学生都以课堂表现、常规习惯、作品呈现来记录，一位学生表现不佳，一位老师如此写道：“往后课堂里，我会努力找到合适这类孩子的创作方式。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至少在一部分外界观点看来，挤占美术课，增加学习时间，提升升学率才是改变务工子女命运的关键。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;桂南学校校长石磊从2017年便在想一个问题，究竟哪些人离我们最近？ “厨师、服务员、修理工、清洁工等，我们真实的生活中，感受源于他们。”石磊说，“我们的学生会有概率成为他们，这是很现实的问题。”据统计，学校仅有35%的学生会升入高中，而剩下的学生则会进入中专、职校等，如果他们对生活有不一样的感受呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;石磊告诉南方周末记者，五年多的时间，学校陆续投了几百万元，改了教室、建了美术馆、买了材料等，减少了学校的招生规模，从2000多学生减少到了1200名左右，加上学费偏低，学校几乎每年都亏损。有同行跑来学校指着他骂，脑子有问题就去看病，“（他们不理解）这件事能帮我涨学费，还是帮我多招生？”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“复制”桂南式的美术教育存在难度。关勇在珠海接触过一些学校，几乎到了最后环节，却因老师反对而作罢。关勇回忆说，老师们不愿意干，认为增加了工作量却没带来额外的收入，自己主动要教，老师也不同意。 “太习以为常了，”关勇说，“不干就走了。”&amp;nbsp;骆筱红告诉南方周末记者，他们曾给一些乡村学校捐赠画笔、颜料等，结果几年过去，东西仍然囤在那里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果你们了解我们的学生，你们只会做得更多。”石磊说，外来务工子弟的生活奔波、飘摇，在生活的压力下缺少机会去舒缓情绪。如果在很紧凑的生活中，多一个出口，生活会不会好一些？九年的时间，上万张作品看下来，生活的审美会不会提高一些？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;石磊成长在工厂的子弟校，从小接触了很多好的美术老师、音乐老师，数年过去，语数外的知识忘却，却记得过去的美术课和音乐课，生活也得益于当时充盈的馈赠。 “别人看我们做了很多作品，画了很多画，这些在我们心里面反而是最不重要的，”石磊说，“我们不是为了这个东西去做这件事情，真正重要的是美育的过程。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

On September 12, 2023, a passenger with terminal cancer booked a Chengdu Airlines ticket at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport but was refused boarding, which attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As can be seen in the video, an old man is sitting in a wheelchair, while another man and the old lady are sitting on the ground and calling airline customer service. The man cried and said, &quot;Nothing is allowed to let me leave. I signed the commitment myself and brought a caregiver with me. Why don&#39;t you let me leave?&quot; Then the man added, &quot;I have cancer. Four months. You said before that if you don&#39;t have heart disease, respiratory disease, or trauma, it&#39;s fine.&quot; The family finally knelt on the ground and begged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Chengdu Airlines staff responded that the passenger was indeed a terminal cancer patient, and the company has clear regulations not to carry such patients to prevent passengers from becoming unwell during the flight. This regulation is publicized in the &quot;General Conditions of Transport&quot; on the official website. If you are a cancer patient in the early or middle stages, there is no absolute restriction on passengers taking the flight. Netizens&#39; opinions are also polarized. Some netizens said that the airline is impersonal and has &quot;overlord clauses&quot; that &quot;discriminate against passengers.&quot; However, some netizens expressed understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident has come to an end, but there are still some issues worthy of analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer for safety reasons. Article 6.1.3 of the &quot;General Conditions of Carriage&quot; on the official website of Chengdu Airlines states, &quot;Passengers with the following diseases will not be transported unless special arrangements are made with Chengdu Airlines&#39; consent.&quot; Paragraph 10 of this article refers to &quot;patients with terminal cancer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only Chengdu Airlines is &quot;not allowed to carry&quot;, but all major domestic airlines also have similar or similar regulations. For example, Air China lists in the general conditions of transportation, &quot;Large vertical septum&quot; &quot;Patients with tumors, extremely large hernias and intestinal obstructions&quot; will not be provided with air transportation services unless agreed or with special arrangements; China Eastern Airlines also states in the &quot;Service Instructions for Sick Passengers&quot; that for &quot;patients with large mediastinal tumors, extremely large hernias&quot; and patients with intestinal obstruction&quot;, it is recommended not to choose to fly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that Chengdu Airlines is not the only airline that &quot;targets&quot; sick passengers. To be more precise, similar regulations of airlines fall into the category of &quot;rejection of transportation and restriction of transportation&quot;. Although the specific regulations of major airlines are different, the principle behind them is the same: airlines cannot guarantee that they can effectively protect and ensure the safety of passengers during the transportation process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Revere regulations, revere life&quot; is by no means an empty phrase in the field of civil aviation. Behind every seemingly strange regulation, there are safety accidents, large and small, and bloody lives as a reminder. For passengers with advanced cancer or special diseases, changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration will pose a great threat to life, and there is a potential risk of sudden illness requiring rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only passengers with special diseases are not suitable for boarding, but also pregnant women who are 32 weeks or more than 36 weeks pregnant are not suitable for boarding. They require medical permission and diagnosis certificate to board with restrictions. This takes into account the potential health risks of pregnant women during flights. By extension, people suffering from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are not suitable for riding roller coasters, and the elderly, weak, sick and young are not suitable for participating in extreme sports such as diving and mountain climbing. This is not a &quot;denial of service&quot; or &quot;discrimination against consumers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the passengers in this incident are more suitable to travel by high-speed rail or car. This can avoid the health risks caused by changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration during flight, and it is easier to get timely information during the trip. medical services. After all, it is much easier to get off the high-speed train or car to see a doctor than to find a doctor while flying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer, which itself reflects the relationship of equal rights and responsibilities between airlines and passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this incident, the &quot;letter of commitment&quot; proposed by the parties concerned attracted more attention. Some netizens believed that since the passengers had &quot;signed and promised to bear all the consequences themselves,&quot; it would be inappropriate for the airline to still refuse to board the plane. Although this statement seems reasonable, it ignores the current laws and the actual situation of civil aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of civil relations, airlines are just commercial institutions that provide transportation services. Their contractual obligation is to safely transport passengers to their destinations by aircraft; passengers purchase transportation services that meet the face value and do not Healthcare that goes beyond face value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If passengers with terminal cancer are allowed to board the plane, the airline may not be able to bear the corresponding risks, and the potential costs required will be far greater than the revenue from this single ticket business, including but not limited to passenger accidents Death, flight turning back after a passenger becomes ill, etc. I would like to ask, once the plane is forced to make a temporary diversion or turn back, who will compensate other passengers for the resulting loss of rights and interests? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil aviation aircraft are not special-purpose &quot;medical aircraft&quot; and do not have the conditions for &quot;airborne ICU&quot;. Once a sick passenger encounters an emergency and requires medical treatment during the flight, it may be an additional task that the airline is unable to handle and has no obligation to handle. Whether a passenger dies or the plane is forced to turn back in an emergency, the total losses suffered by all parties will undoubtedly be much greater. A &quot;letter of commitment to bear the consequences&quot; that may not be legally binding cannot persuade airlines to ignore possible risks and bear huge potential costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the airline&#39;s refusal to board passengers with terminal cancer is not so much &quot;discrimination&quot; with a more positive or negative meaning, but rather &quot;differential treatment&quot; based on specific circumstances. This &quot;differential treatment&quot; not only shows respect for the safety of passengers&#39; lives and property, but also demonstrates the principle of &quot;equivalence of rights and responsibilities&quot;. Airlines and passengers are both civil subjects, and their rights and obligations are completely equal. Airlines have the right to refuse service to passengers who exceed their obligations and capabilities. Passengers can also choose other aviation service providers who are willing to take greater risks, or other means of transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一块钱酸梅汤打败“入秋第一杯奶茶”，网红中药能刷医保吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256723]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[旧房换新房，能否激活淄博楼市？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256841]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250933&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;April 10, 2023, Qisheng Lake Park, Zibo, Shandong . (Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These days, some staff from local government departments always call Li Bin to ask him about the &quot;trade-in&quot; method of buying a house in Zibo. mode and specific operating procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 6, 2023, the Zibo Real Estate Development Association and the Municipal Real Estate Brokerage and Appraisal Association jointly launched a signing ceremony for the &quot;old-for-new&quot; home purchase, with the first batch of 12 companies Representatives of real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies signed cooperation agreements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to &quot;Zibo Daily&quot;, &quot;old for new&quot; means exchanging old houses for new ones. Real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies join forces to speed up the sales of existing housing. Real estate companies give priority to providing high-quality housing to meet the replacement needs of home buyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, there is still a lot of speculation in the market about the specific method of &quot;trade-in&quot;. On the short video platform, some people interpreted that Zibo’s “old-for-new” policy for home purchases this time allows the appraisal agency to “give the money after the old house has been appraised to the home buyer, and the home buyer will then use the money to buy a new home.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Trading old for new&quot; was the earliest housing sales model tried by Beike. On September 13, as the deputy general manager of Shell (Shandong) Internet Co., Ltd., Li Bin clarified to Southern Weekend reporters: When the original customer replaced, if the second-hand house he lived in before could not be sold, he would not have the funds on hand to buy a new house. Deposit. The current &quot;old-for-new&quot; model requires developers, intermediaries and customers to sign an agreement. According to the agreement, after the customer pays the deposit, the developer will give the customer 90-180 days to sell the house and reserve the customer&#39;s favorite house; The intermediary also promotes customers’ second-hand houses on the platform. If the customer&#39;s house is still not sold after the agreement period, the deposit will be refunded. &quot;The core of &#39;trade-in&#39; old for new&#39; is to shorten the replacement cycle between new and second-hand houses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/09/15/56104f158b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1434&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15 /56104f158b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Local Government Concerned about the decommissioning of new houses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Shandong, Jinan City was the first to launch the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2023, the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association held a seminar on the &quot;Real Estate Market Situation in the First Half of the Year&quot;. In addition to the member units of the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association, the meeting was also attended by the Shandong Provincial Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Finance and Economics Office of the Provincial Party Committee, the Jinan Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau and some financial institutions. Li Bin remembers that that meeting was the starting point for the debut of &quot;old for new&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It was recognized by some developers in Jinan at that time.&quot; Li Bin said that in late August, &quot;old for new&quot; began to be piloted in some projects in Jinan. Taking a project of a real estate company as an example, Beike provides home buyers with second-hand house evaluation, listing, inspection and transaction services. For second-hand houses that meet transaction standards, Beike will help customers sell their houses quickly within 30-90 days; the project team Provide 1%-2% home purchase subsidies to buyers of second-hand houses to speed up the sales of second-hand houses. Among them, buyers of first-hand houses can lock in the house they want by paying 100,000 yuan, and then pay for the new house after the second-hand house is sold. If the second-hand house is not sold, they can enjoy check-out guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin remembered that at a real estate brokerage seminar held in Zibo in August, staff from the relevant administrative departments in Zibo also expressed their opinions on this &quot;old-for-new&quot; housing buying and selling model. I was very interested and suggested that Zibo&#39;s industry associations could also try to promote it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The core method is to shorten the transaction time between new homes and second homes, and the government plays a supporting and encouraging role in this.&quot; Li Bin introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhuge housing search data shows that from January to July 2023, the price of new houses in Zibo continued to climb, rising from 8,272 yuan/square meter to 8,425 yuan/square meter. But the price dropped to 8,389 yuan/square meter in August. In contrast, Zibo&#39;s second-hand housing prices have been rising month after month, and since November 2022, there has been an inversion of primary and second-hand housing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin explained to Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;replacing old houses with new ones&quot; requires accelerating the disposal of second-hand houses and at the same time making a good connection with the replacement of new houses. If the second-hand house in the hands of the home buyer cannot be sold, he will not have the down payment for the new house, and he will not be able to make the decision to buy a new house. &quot;Data shows that the average transaction cycle for second-hand houses in Jinan City is now 175 days, and even more than 250 days in Zibo.&quot; In smaller cities and counties, the transaction cycle for second-hand houses will be longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin introduced that the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy for buying houses will be implemented in many cities in Shandong such as Tai&#39;an and Jining. In addition to Shandong, some cities outside the province also want to learn about relevant experiences. Li Bin found that the local governments who came to communicate would be more concerned about the sale of new houses. “After all, the sale of new houses is the most important means for cities to activate the real estate market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are more people waiting and watching&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;September 8, &quot;Zibo Daily&quot; More than 40 first-hand properties with &quot;old-for-new&quot; agreements were announced. However, several local real estate agents in Zibo told Southern Weekend reporters that more people who want to buy a house are still waiting and watching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Yuan (pseudonym), a real estate agent in Zibo City, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the introduction of the &quot;old for new&quot; policy, the number of people viewing houses has increased significantly, more than before. One-third, his daily working hours also increased from the original 12 hours to 14 hours. He said that if the agent fails to sell the old house within the three months stipulated in the agreement, the client will take back the old house and the deposit, which is &quot;equivalent to three months of work in vain.&quot; Zhang Yuan explained that the policy will bring greater workload to the intermediary, but if the client is sure to sell the old house, he will have more confidence to buy a new house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another Zibo real estate agent, Sun Yu (pseudonym), updated his policy interpretation on the short video platform on September 8. In addition, he receives twenty or thirty related consultation calls every day. There are people who are in a hurry to sell their old house and buy a new one and ask more than a dozen questions at once, while there are also people who inquire casually and take a wait-and-see attitude. Sun Yu told Southern Weekend reporters that developers of large real estate projects generally do not accept old houses. “If he (the developer) wants to sell new houses, why would he buy second-hand houses?” As for intermediaries, they are generally willing to represent large-property houses. , that is, houses where the owner owns the house and can produce a real estate certificate, &quot;the sales difficulty is low and the transaction rate is higher.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu said that the second-hand houses for sale in his hands are mainly located in Zhangdian West District, the main urban area of ​​Zibo, which is also what the intermediary calls Zibo&#39;s &quot;prime location.&quot; The highest price here exceeds 20,000 yuan per square meter, while in the suburbs with the lowest prices, one square meter sells for only 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, which is a quarter of the price in the central city. &quot;The first-hand properties participating in the &#39;trade-in&#39; program are not very easy to sell,&quot; Sun Yu said. Most of them are located in the suburbs of Zibo with relatively poor locations, and the number of houses in the school district is relatively small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are already customers who have successfully &quot;traded in old products for new ones&quot; with Sun Yu. This is a 35-year-old customer. He needs to sell his old house in the eastern part of Zhangdian District before he can have enough budget to buy a house in a school district. Previously, this old house had been listed on the trading platform for nearly half a year without any interest. In the past few days, Sun Yu sold the client&#39;s old house for 800,000 yuan, and the client spent more than 1.5 million yuan to buy a school district house in the southwest area of ​​Zhangdian. In Sun Yu&#39;s opinion, this is one of the best-located houses in the first-hand real estate that participates in the &quot;old-for-new&quot; project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu currently opens his own real estate agency in Zibo, with more than a dozen employees, and his business focuses on the sale of first-hand and second-hand houses. He said that the current policy has not brought significant changes in sales volume to the company. In 2023, the company&#39;s monthly housing sales will mainly focus on 3 to 5 units. The New Deal has led to more people consulting, &quot;but everyone is very cautious, and there are more people waiting and watching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
