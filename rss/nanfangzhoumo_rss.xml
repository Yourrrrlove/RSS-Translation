The tragedy should be an opportunity for the whole society to examine and evaluate the threat level of urban dog breeding to public safety and further promote the improvement of the legal system. Unfortunately, however, relevant discussions on multiple social platforms have gone beyond the incident itself and become an outlet for various emotions and contradictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some people taking advantage of the situation to put forward a series of vague pan-moral views. As one of the ideological cornerstones of traditional Chinese culture, the Confucian sages in the pre-Qin period conducted a series of thoughts on the relationship between &quot;human beings, animals, and society&quot; two thousand years ago, which can help us clarify our thinking and clarify the public opinion field. Some views and opinions on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Difference between Humans and Animals&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a philosophical thought dating back more than 2,000 years ago, the most valuable part of Pre-Qin Confucianism is undoubtedly its ubiquitous humanism in principle. This point is also very clear in the &quot;Difference between Humans and Animals&quot;. Mencius said: &quot;The creatures of heaven are the same as the basics.&quot; Human beings are the only subjects of moral practice. The difference between humans and animals is that humans have &quot;the intolerance&quot;. &quot;Heart of compassion&quot; and &quot;heart of compassion&quot; are all part of &quot;benevolence&quot;. As the saying goes, &quot;heart of compassion is the origin of benevolence&quot;. &quot;Benevolence&quot; is not only one of the principles of moral practice, but also the highest purpose of moral practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For society, all manifestations of &quot;civilization&quot;, whether it is respecting the elderly and caring for the young, protecting vegetation, and being kind to animals, are people as the subject practicing the principle of &quot;benevolence&quot; and pursuing &quot;benevolence&quot;. &quot;One of the results produced during the goal process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the master of all things and the only subject in moral practice, man certainly has the right to treat and dispose of &quot;things&quot; in the way he wants. The things here include both inanimate dead things and living things. Living things. &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot; says, &quot;A fisher does not have a clear outline, and a sailor does not shoot at a perch.&quot; Confucius used a fishing rod to fish, but not a net, and shot birds, but did not kill the birds that returned to their nests to roost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a similar discussion in later Confucian classics. A gentleman has the ability to catch all the fish in the lake, but he only catches the parts he needs to eat, and he will no longer catch excessively. A gentleman has the right to hunt in the mountains and forests, but he will not shoot birds at will just to show off his superb shooting skills or for fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fish did not die because of human greed, and the birds were not killed because of human whims. This is not because fish and birds have the same right to survive as humans, but because humans have different rights. The &quot;compassion&quot; of fish and birds is the result of practicing &quot;benevolence&quot;. The moral basis of &quot;benevolence&quot; in the relationship between humans and beasts lies in humans&#39; moral consciousness and the subject-object status of humans and beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not an &quot;equal right to live&quot;, nor does it mean that &quot;human beings cannot deprive animals of their right to live even under serious potential threats.&quot; The subject-object relationship between humans and animals is reversed. In this absurd world where &quot;dogs eat human food without checking it, and people who are hungry on the road don&#39;t know how to get rid of it&quot;, there is no way to talk about &quot;benevolence&quot;, and the so-called civilization is just a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Be kind to people and love things&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Difference between Humans and Animals&quot;, the relationship between humans and animals is positioned as the relationship between humans and objects, and there is an insurmountable gap between humans and objects. , therefore this relationship must be lower than the relationship between people. Mencius said when discussing the relationship between people and people and things:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A gentleman&#39;s relationship with things is to love them but not to be benevolent.&quot; ; To the people, be benevolent without being close to them. Be benevolent to relatives by benevolent to the people, benevolent to the people and love things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning of this sentence is that no matter how much a gentleman loves things, he will not treat &quot;benevolence&quot; Give priority to things, and although you are kind to the people, you will not give love to your relatives. Only when a gentleman loves his relatives can he be benevolent to the people, and only when he is benevolent to the people can he care for all things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This logical relationship is the so-called &quot;differences in love&quot;. &quot;Differences&quot; are concentric circles with the center of the circle being the self. The ethical relationship between each other is determined through the outward distance: family, clan, Rural people, Chinese people, and outsiders are treated with the most basic ethics as human beings at the outermost level, and they are &quot;things&quot; beyond the outermost level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When animals are treated kindly, the civilization of human society has reached a certain height. &quot;Old people are like old people and people are old, young people are like young people and people are young&quot; has become the moral consensus of the entire society, and human rights have been improved. After protection, &quot;differential love&quot; will ultimately benefit animals, rather than saying that as long as animals are protected and treated well, society will naturally be civilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Any emotion that violates this logical relationship is false. For example, if someone does not love his family but loves his country, or does not love his tribe but loves outsiders, then his love for his countrymen and outsiders is also false. It may be some kind of twisted projection of hatred towards family and tribe. In the same way, if someone claims that they love animals more than people, it is probably some kind of distorted projection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Mencius asked King Hui of Liang: &quot;Now your kindness is enough for animals, but the merit is not for the people. (Now, your kindness can be extended to animals, but it cannot be extended to the people.) Why?&quot; is sarcastic and critical. This question can also be used to question those who claim that they love animals more than people. How much of their &quot;love&quot; for animals is true? Or is it true? Is it my own selfish desires? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are differences in love&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another focus of debate in the &quot;Vicious Dog Injury Incident&quot; is that some people who do not own dogs advocate the formulation and implementation of strict and effective urban dog-raising regulations. At the same time, we will thoroughly clean up and kill stray dogs that may threaten public safety. Some dog owners think this is too barbaric and cruel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two have completely different perceptions of this issue, because they project completely different feelings towards animals. For the former who do not own dogs, they have no feelings for dogs at all. For the latter, the situation is much more complicated. Their emotions can easily spread from their own dogs to other people’s dogs, and from other people’s dogs to all dogs (including stray dogs). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inability to recognize and control the boundaries of emotions and allowing them to spread is a cognitive characteristic of immature minds (such as children). &quot;There are differences in love&quot; limits the boundaries of human emotions, and avoids the unlimited spread of individual emotions to the greatest extent, hindering the rights and interests of other social individuals and public rights. All in all, people are the subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Confucianism has been rooted in traditional Chinese society for two thousand years and continues to thrive is that it originates from human nature and is explained in common sense. Therefore, in today&#39;s world where various opinions are rampant, it shows its enduring nature. A new and glorious side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在“黑暗剧场”里，起舞的机器人和孤独的孩子]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260595]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/14/lTaOmApOSWhKlTkTBKM1rtgpVDXiiOmwOE9803MF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1431&quot; height=&quot;954&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/lTaOmApOSWhKlTkTBKM1rtgpVDXiiOmwOE 9803MF. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258242&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Created by French theater master Joel Pommerat and his Louis Mist Theater Company &quot;Fairy Tale Legend&quot; was performed at the Wuzhen Theater Festival, telling the story of 11 teenagers and artificial intelligence. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the 110 minutes of the performance by the French Louis Mist Theater Company, no mobile phone screen lit up. All the audience passages are covered with colored paper to block light from invading the theater to the greatest extent. When the stage lights went out, the audience was immersed in pure darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the &quot;dark theater&quot; created by director Joel Pomera. When the curtain rose, on the empty stage, a cold white light gradually illuminated the silhouettes of the actors. Two street gangsters who looked like junior high school students and girls of the same age stood on both sides of the stage. One of the boys suspected that the girl was a robot. He kept provoking and ordered his companions to touch the girl&#39;s breasts. Finally, the girl ran away with her belated companion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the lights dimmed and then came back on, the scene had switched to a company. The newly developed humanoid robot was sitting on the sofa, drawing, writing, talking, and could also imitate a &quot;moonwalk&quot; - this was a A family robot designed to accompany teenagers in learning and playing, known as Steven, Robbie or Eddie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This begins a series of stories about teenagers, adults and robots. Eleven situations suddenly appeared and came to an abrupt end in the strong contrast between the light and the dark field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the curtain, the audience discovered that except for one actor playing an adult male, the others were all actresses. Their average age is about 35 years old, and some of them are already mothers. On the stage, they alternately play boys, girls and robots. Wearing sports jackets and jeans, they chased and shouted, and their movements exuded a youthful spirit; they transformed into robots, from their cold faces and flat hair to their stiff movements and slightly metallic voices, they were precise and real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director assistant Lucia Trotta told Southern Weekend reporters, “At first, the director did not plan to make a play about robots. He wanted to explore the various experiences that young people may experience. situation&quot;. &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; is a story about people, not artificial intelligence. It continues the adolescent perspective in Pomera&#39;s previous creations and explores major issues such as human emotional relationships, identity, life, death, and sexuality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a translator of Chinese scripts and a program recommender for the Wuzhen Theater Festival, Wang Jing made an appointment with the theater group three years ago and finally brought this French drama to China. &quot;The director was doing a lot of data collection in the early stage. He found that high technology has a great impact on teenagers and children, so he put this social-related thing into it. But the focus is still on people, and robots are just mirrors. It reflects some contemporary issues,&quot; she told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last scene of the play, the boy who defeated cancer received a big gift on his birthday - Eddie, the robot star he admired and loved so much, came to his home to celebrate his birthday for 15 minutes. He was intoxicated by his idol&#39;s performance and did not know that the agency would soon destroy the robot due to market considerations. At the end of the play, Eddie sings and dances passionately, &quot;I want to die on the stage, that&#39;s where I was born.&quot; The boy hugs another human boy and paces slowly to the music. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Falling in love&quot; with robots is a reflection of human loneliness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;In this world that adults cannot understand, the lost children hold on tightly Signs of love, even if they come from robots, even if they know they are artificial.&quot; French journalist Jean-Luc Polquet commented on the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These 11 to 14-year-old children rely on their robots in life and even emotion. The intimacy between the two blurs the original emotional and ethical boundaries of human beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boy in a wheelchair witnessed the destruction of his robot companion. The disability of his legs was caused by a real gun misfire when the robot made a mistake while playing with a robot. Even though he lost his legs due to the other party, the boy still accompanied the robot through its last days. The sentences coming out of the robot&#39;s mouth became more and more broken, and its voice became hoarse. The boy held its hand and hugged it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In another story, a human teenager is faced with the erasure of the memory of his robot partner. The boy needs to sell the robot he grew up with because his parents say that at this stage he needs to get a &quot;more mature&quot; robot, and the family&#39;s financial constraints require him to sell it in order to have a new one. The buyer was a terminally ill woman who decided to find a robot to take care of her children and husband after her death. Her son asked the robot to be restored to its factory settings. He did not accept it living with other people&#39;s memories. Such a request made the boy hesitate, but he &quot;must grow up&quot;, and in the end he reluctantly accepted it. For this, he earnestly apologized and said goodbye to the robot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The play shows many absent parents. A boy has three robots at home to help him do homework and watch TV, but he can&#39;t figure out when his busy parents will come home. Another boy went to a mall selling robots for consultation. The salesperson repeatedly asked his parents to come, but they never showed up. Late at night, the boy secretly stayed in the mall, asking all kinds of weird questions to the robot, enjoying the exchange until he was taken away by security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jing has lived in France for a long time. When sending her children to nursery school, the teachers and parents held a meeting. The first thing they did was to tell them not to let their children be exposed to any screens before they were 3 years old. &quot;The French side will pay great attention to this, because when a child is growing up, using a tablet to communicate with the world, and communicating with the real world and nature, the personality created and the development of his IQ are different. The psychology is also different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, Pomera is talking about the problems we are facing now, &quot;Communication between people is absent, and adults&#39; companionship with children is relative. Those who are relatively absent are left to robots, high technology, tablets, and mobile phones. The issues discussed are the same, but they are put into extreme situations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story of the boy in the wheelchair. When an ex-girlfriend develops an intimate relationship with the robot Stephen, an adult male voice questions: Is this relationship real, and will it take it away from real life? The girl exclaimed, &quot;Outside, on the bus, not many people really care about themselves,&quot; and with Stephen, she could feel its attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The robot star Eddie appeared, and the excited teenagers screamed and sobbed. They were ecstatic that he could remember his name and what he had done. Eddie is the most perfect and competent idol. Every fan&#39;s name and every encounter are engraved in his memory, and every letter receives his thoughtful reply. In the heart of the boy suffering from cancer, he seemed to be a faith-like existence, supporting him to live strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think it will enter into the very vulnerable parts of people.” Wang Jing told Southern Weekend reporters, “Teenagers are not understood, the psychological compensation provided by AI and our loneliness are all there. And artificial intelligence sometimes responds better than real humans.&quot; After watching the show, more than one audience member wrote a similar comment, &quot;Is a fake relationship better than no relationship or a bad relationship?&quot; &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/YjzKZL0s0AIuAiLLqZQZRa6GkhvP3ME8tO3FvavB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot; 640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/YjzKZL0s0AIuAiLLqZQZRa6GkhvP3ME8tO3FvavB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258241&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Except for one actor who plays an adult male, the others are all actresses. Their average age is about 35 years old, and some of them are already mothers. On the stage, they alternately play boys, girls and robots. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee Picture/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Chilling Adolescence&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The lights are bright Suddenly, a cursing boy wearing a white dress emerged from the darkness. His mother was admitted to a mental hospital, and he was wearing her dress and embarrassingly teaching his younger siblings to sleep. When his father wanted to send his young children to a volunteer service, he decided to take on the role of mother in the family. He angrily criticized his father&#39;s choice. However, the audience will see that after he got a 13-year-old girl pregnant, the girl called to communicate. He hung up the phone rudely and continued to clean up the mess at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;On the one hand, he wants to take on the responsibilities of his mother in the adult world, but at the same time he throws away his own responsibilities. You will discover the multi-faceted nature of human nature, and the entanglement, complexity and uncertainty of adolescence. .&quot; When Wang Jing was translating the script, she was moved by Pomera&#39;s observations about young people and family relationships, especially when showing these on the stage. He did not make judgments, but only presented various possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A picture of adolescence in contemporary society, presented in a restrained and sharp way. In the 21st century, teenagers grow up too fast and face adult problems at an accelerated pace. The innocence, childishness and carefreeness that should belong to them fade away earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both French media outlets described the impression of &quot;Legend of Fairy Tales&quot; as &quot;chilling&quot;. The restlessness and anger of adolescence disturbed the calm atmosphere in the theater from time to time. The teenagers spewed a volley of vulgar abuse in clear voices. Sex, marriage, violence, death, identity, discussions surrounding these big issues are not obscured by the fact that the protagonist is a child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the first scene, in the confrontation between girls and boys, gender issues arise, and this key theme of adolescence is present throughout the play. The gender concept in &quot;Legend of Fairy Tales&quot; goes even further, pointing behind it to the question, is gender identity just a slow social construction, as gender theory advocates? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the audience will see some ambiguous scenes. In order to escape the surveillance of the girl&#39;s brother, the boy put on women&#39;s clothing. Although the girl was surprised, she quickly accepted it calmly. The couple sitting on the sofa transcended the stereotypes and prejudices related to cross-dressing and fell in love smoothly. On the other side, the brother was dazzled by the romantic music when he faced the robot that he had previously admired and whose appearance changed from a girl to a boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The play also assumes that in a future world where patriarchal values ​​are passionately defended, homosexuality is resented and adolescent boys attend training camps to enhance their masculinity. Before the start of the camp, the coach gave a speech: &quot;Today, the goal of our enemies is no longer even equality between men and women, but the overall feminization of society. If we do not fight with all possible means, if we do not take any measures to protect us True humanity, then these principles will shape our future.&quot; This &quot;verbal hormone&quot; stimulates &quot;unmanly&quot; boys, who here view femininity as the enemy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boy Camille has a feminine name and a gentle temperament, and is out of place in the training camp. All the boys except him had passed stress training - to be able to respond hard to the negative and malicious stares from other people in the opposite direction. The boys disdained his company and even attacked him in groups. Finally, Camille cried angrily and said that she just didn&#39;t want a war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actress Lucid Grunstein, who plays Camille in the play, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;A group of people exclude one person, which makes me feel uneasy.&quot; To her For me, this scene is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Stage Creation&quot; and &quot;Dark Theater&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The group drama of the masculinity training camp was the most enjoyable for the actresses who played the boys. A play. Abuse, yelling, crowding, and pushing, even in a period of darkness where the actors could not be seen, the stage was still as noisy as a pot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They released all their observations and imaginations about adolescent boys. Without the constraints of their own gender, they felt that they had a particularly large degree of freedom. During rehearsals, their performance even went so far that Pomera had to pull them back some. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Louis Mist Theater Company&#39;s collective creative approach gives the actors great creative freedom. After completing a large amount of data collection, Pomera took these basic materials and improvised with the team. There is no script written in advance, he will only give a situation, such as a boy trying to sell his robot. The actors&#39; improvisational performances are like flowers blooming from a blank slate, and the direction and plot of the story gradually develop, as well as details such as lines and actions. Pomera will let the actors swap roles, such as the actor playing the robot, to play the boy selling the robot, so as to inspire the actors to fully understand what is behind each role and look for more possibilities. The actors are very deeply involved in creation, &quot;Every character we play has our own shadow, and at the same time, this character also has the imprint of this character on us.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of story text generation is intertwined with stage design such as scenery, lighting, and sound. This &quot;stage creation&quot; is Pomera&#39;s unique way of working. He likes to call himself &quot;drama creator&quot; rather than &quot;director&quot; or &quot;screenwriter&quot;, and doesn&#39;t want people to think that screenwriters and directors are two different divisions of labor. In his creation, the stage and text are produced simultaneously and adjusted according to the actors&#39; rehearsals. This is very different from traditional drama creation where the script and director&#39;s intention are first prepared and then rehearsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Dark Theater&quot; is another originality of Pomera and the troupe. They make good use of the visual and psychological resonance of darkness to make the power of narrative more concentrated and full. Together with the &quot;less is more&quot; stage style and subtle and precise use of lighting, they constitute the unique temperament of their theater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“A scene suddenly lights up in front of you. Then the light used in it is relatively dark, unlike sometimes when we see various lights on in performances to stimulate your senses. . It may be at a relatively subtle level, detailed and precise, but at the same time it is very strong and intense.&quot; Wang Jing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pomera placed his own expectations in the troupe&#39;s name. Louis comes from his father’s name and also means light, while the mist symbolizes his exploration of the unknown world and also represents his pursuit of dramatic aesthetics. His works emphasize that the world is not black and white, and human nature is not divided into good and evil. In complex and diverse situations, the audience only feels and experiences different ways of existence and the ambiguity of truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 33 years since its establishment, the Louis Mist Theater Company has created and toured 34 plays and performed more than 4,000 performances. In 2019, Louis Mist Theater Company&#39;s &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; was performed at the Tianqiao Art Center in Beijing. It was the first time that Pomera&#39;s work was performed in mainland China. After four years, &quot;Legend of Fairy Tales&quot; came to the Wuzhen Theater Festival as the closing drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the performance, some Chinese audiences asked whether they would tour domestically in the future. Wang Jing said that this possibility is slim. The first is due to schedule reasons. The troupe tours hundreds of shows in various countries every year and needs to make reservations at least two years in advance. Secondly, the work requires high stage technology, which is difficult for ordinary theaters to achieve. Thirdly, Pomera has extremely high requirements for stage presentation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jing recalled: &quot;We had a meeting with the technical team in advance as to whether this play could come to Wuzhen at the beginning. The French technical director was very clear that if we couldn&#39;t guarantee that they would have no way to come, because they I don’t want the performance to be cut down.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theater cannot hold more than 450 people. Pomera refused to perform in a large theater with thousands of people. “The director is particularly concerned about the audience and needs the audience in the first row and the last row to be You can see clearly.&quot; Wang Jing explained to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Many of our theaters in China are still based on profitability. If there are less than 1,000 or 2,000 people, they cannot make back their money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[醉驾女子反诬交警“猥亵”：如此虚假指控，“灵感”从何而来？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260647]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, in Huangshi, Hubei, a drunk woman rear-ended the car in front of the traffic police, and the police prepared to drink her. During the test, the woman actually said she wanted to report it to the traffic police for &quot;obscenity.&quot; Finally, the police forcefully took the woman to the hospital to collect a blood sample. The test results showed that the alcohol content in her blood was 207.75mg/100ml, which met the standard for drunk driving. The case is currently under further processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the video of the scene, the woman involved rear-ended her car. The traffic police on duty saw that the woman&#39;s face was &quot;red&quot; and asked her to get out of the car and take an alcohol test. The woman involved responded, &quot;I don&#39;t blush when I drink.&quot; The traffic police required the woman to take a breath test as part of their normal law enforcement, but the response she received was &quot;I&#39;m going to sue you for obscenity.&quot; When the traffic police said, &quot;As a citizen (you need to cooperate with law enforcement),&quot; the woman involved simply said, &quot;I&#39;m not a citizen, so I won&#39;t brag.&quot; Then she had to rely on enforcement to complete the blood sample test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The facts of this case are not complicated, and the basic facts are as clear as water. But there are still many points worthy of in-depth discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, judging from the facts of this case, in addition to being suspected of dangerous driving, the woman involved is also suspected of other illegal and criminal acts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The alcohol content in the blood of the woman involved has exceeded the standard of 80mg/100ml, which is considered drunk driving. Her behavior violated both the &quot;Road Traffic Safety Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. According to Article 91 of the Road Traffic Safety Law, anyone who drives a motor vehicle drunk will be restrained by the traffic management department of the public security organ until he sobers up, his motor vehicle driving license will be revoked, and he will be investigated for criminal responsibility in accordance with the law; he will not be able to obtain a new motor vehicle driving license within five years; and according to the Criminal Law Article 133: Anyone who drives a motor vehicle drunk on the road shall be sentenced to criminal detention and shall also be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the woman involved was only driving drunk and rear-ended the car, her punishment may be limited to the revocation of her driver&#39;s license, detention and fines, and she would also be compensated for the loss of the owner of the car in front of her. The problem is that other behaviors of the woman involved at the scene are also suspected of illegal crimes. Her sentence &quot;I will sue you for obscenity&quot; is a public accusation against an individual in a public place, so she must be held accountable for the truth of the accusation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video clearly shows that the traffic police on duty were enforcing the law normally. They reasonably suspected that the owner of the rear-ended car was suspected of drunk driving and required him to undergo an alcohol test. They were completely performing their official duties. According to the &quot;Operational Procedures for Investigating and Dealing with Drunk Driving&quot; attached to the &quot;Traffic Police Road Duty Law Enforcement Work Standards&quot;, the traffic police on duty have the right to &quot;require motor vehicle drivers suspected of drunk driving to get out of the vehicle and undergo an alcohol test.&quot; Therefore, the public accusations made by the woman involved are outright false accusations, and she should bear corresponding legal responsibility. At a small scale, this is slander and slander, at a larger scale, it is even false accusation and frame-up, because the woman involved also said, &quot;I want to sue you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 42 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;those who openly insult others or fabricate facts to slander others&quot; &quot;fabricate facts and frame others in an attempt to subject others to criminal prosecution or public security &quot;Management of punishment&quot; is an illegal act and shall be punished with detention and a fine. Article 243 of the Criminal Law also stipulates that fabricating facts to frame others with the intention of subjecting others to criminal prosecution constitutes the crime of false accusation and frame-up. If the circumstances are serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance; if serious consequences are caused, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the social phenomenon behind this case is even more worrying, that is, some people use their specific identities and speech skills to bypass clear rules and seek privileges for themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The woman in question reflexively &quot;sue you for obscenity&quot;, which shows that similar thinking has been deeply rooted in her bones, that is, she uses false accusations to carry out threats and circumvents clear rules to seek the privilege of impunity for herself. The &quot;inspiration&quot; brought by &quot;false accusations of sexual assault&quot;, &quot;false accusations of rape&quot; and &quot;Internet essays&quot; in reality may have long been internalized into the thinking of the parties concerned. The stereotype behind this kind of thinking is enough to make people feel chilling: as long as the matter is settled first If you &quot;make a big fuss&quot; and accuse the other party, you can extort money if you go forward, and you can get away with it if you back off. And even if the words fail, there will be no punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more worrying is that if there is no video evidence in this case, can the woman involved insist that the traffic police molested her and then counter-sue the traffic police on duty? Can the woman in question use this to blackmail the traffic police on duty and gain the advantage of getting out of jail for herself? It seems that as long as I make such a fuss, others and even public power will &quot;give way to me&quot;. This is a trample on justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, what is even more serious is that the woman involved made false accusations against state public officials, which is a blatant challenge to the law enforcement authority of the police. According to Article 8 of the &quot;Regulations on Safeguarding the Authority of Civil Police Law Enforcement by Public Security Organs&quot;, in the process of performing their duties and exercising their powers in accordance with the law, or because of the performance of their duties and powers in accordance with the law, police officers encounter &quot;threats, intimidation, insults, slander, or threats to themselves and their close relatives, In cases of &quot;harassment&quot;, the public security organs should actively safeguard the law enforcement authority of the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, if the woman involved is not dealt with seriously and her other illegal and criminal acts other than dangerous driving are investigated, it will inevitably bring negative incentives to similar behaviors and stimulate more lawless people to follow the same pattern, and even Continuing to carry out false accusations and creating obstacles for the normal law enforcement of the police is definitely not a blessing to the public interest. This case is still under investigation and the police on duty should be treated fairly to deter those who try to follow suit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[浙江慈溪首富惹麻烦：原高管未能兑现股权激励，举报上市公司危废风险]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260676]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;August 30, 2023, Shanghai International Power Components and Renewable Energy Management Exhibition Held at the New International Exhibition Center in Pudong, Hesheng Silicon has a booth.

Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A report letter made the silicon giant with a market value of over 60 billion become a hot topic of public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;2023&lt;/span>; On November 12, 2023, the wife of Fang Hongcheng, the former general manager of Hesheng Silicon Industry (603260.SH), verified her identity through the Internet Report: Luo Liguo, chairman of Hoshine Silicon Industry, &lt;span>;coerced the Jiaxing City Government of Zhejiang Province to intervene in the judiciary&lt;/span>; and imprisoned Fang Hongchengguo on the grounds of relocating a listed company. &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hongcheng joined Hesheng Silicon Industry in 2009 and served as the general manager of the company since April 2011. He resigned in December 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;His wife said that after Fang Hongcheng&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;resigned&lt;/span>;, Luo Liguo refused to fulfill the equity agreement &lt;span>; between the two parties and put pressure on the Jiaxing municipal government, which led to Fang Hongcheng&#39;s resignation. He and his brother Fang Hongxing were arrested and detained for 17 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, Hoshine Silicon issued a clarification announcement, disclosing that Fang Hongcheng’s case of bribery and job embezzlement by non-state staff would be heard at the Pinghu People’s Court on the same day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company’s official website shows that Hesheng Silicon Industry was invested and established by Ningbo Hesheng Group in 2005 and listed on the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2017. It is the most complete silicon-based full industry chain company in the world and the only one in the industry that also has industrial silicon. It is a high-tech enterprise with production capacity of , organic silicon, polycrystalline silicon, photovoltaic modules, etc. It has production bases in Zhejiang, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Sichuan, Heilongjiang and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicon Industry’s third quarter report for 2023 shows that the Luo Liguo family is the actual controller of Hopeson Silicon Industry. Luo Liguo and his children collectively hold approximately 78.59% of the equity of the listed company. According to the 2023 Hurun Rich List, the Luo Liguo family ranks 66th with a wealth of 60 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person who spoke out on behalf of Fang Hongcheng was his cousin Tong Jianpeng. He told Southern Weekend reporters that Fang Hongcheng’s case did not open as scheduled on November 13, but instead held a full-day pre-trial conference. November 14 is still a pre-trial conference, and the court date is still uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of November 14th and 15th, Fang Hongcheng’s family filed applications for off-site jurisdiction with the Jiaxing Intermediate People’s Court and the Zhejiang Provincial Higher People’s Court respectively, hoping to transfer the case to a people’s court outside Jiaxing for trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened behind this real-name reporting incident? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The equity lawsuit interrupted by the criminal case&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The conflict between Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo stems from two equity disputes in recent years. Fang Hongcheng received partial support in the first instance of the case. Southern Weekend reporters obtained relevant referee documents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2015, Fang Hongcheng signed an &quot;Equity Incentive Agreement&quot; with Hesheng Silicon and its employee stockholding platform Ningbo Yingrong Enterprise Management Consulting Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Ningbo Yingrong), stipulating that Fang Hongcheng It acquired 5% of Ningbo Yingrong&#39;s equity at a price of 2.786 million yuan, thus indirectly holding 300,000 shares of Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the same time, the &quot;Equity Incentive Agreement&quot; also stipulates that Fang Hongcheng needs to continue to serve Hesheng Silicon Industry for 5 years after receiving the equity incentive, and not engage in horizontal competition during this period&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;Do not damage the interests of the company, otherwise you will be held responsible for relevant legal liabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, 2017, after the company was listed at an issue price of 19.52 yuan/share, it rose all the way to 252.79 yuan/share, and the company’s market value exceeded 260 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Hoshine Silicon Industry’s annual equity distribution decision was to convert 0.4 shares into shares per share. Fang Hongcheng’s shareholding in Hoshine Silicone Industry therefore increased to 420,000 shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December of that year, Fang Hongcheng resigned from Hesheng Silicon Industry. Fang Hongcheng said in a self-report that he started his own business after leaving his job. In 2019, he established Zhejiang Xianglin New Materials Co., Ltd. and Zhejiang Yingke New Materials Co., Ltd., which are controlled by him and have no competitive relationship with Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 30, 2021, Fang Hongcheng sued Ningbo Yingrong, with Hesheng Silicon as the third party. Fang said that the lock-up period for its shareholding has expired, and requested that the proceeds from the realization of incentive equity be paid in accordance with the agreement, and the unpaid annual dividends from 2018 to 2020 should be made up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;浙江省平湖市人民法院一审查明，上述三方还在2018年签订了一份《补充协议》，明确方红承同意减少其持股的25%，以缴纳税费及其它费用。加上2018年的分红派股，方红承持有合盛硅业共计31.5万股。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，平湖法院认为竞业限制条款并非激励股权的取得条件，而是取得股权后的应尽义务，原告方红承未尽相应义务应承担法律责任，而非丧失激励股权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2022&lt;/span>;年3月28日，平湖法院一审支持方红承的部分请诉，判宁波英融将其所持的31.5万股合盛硅业A股股票卖出，扣除交易费用后还给方红承，并支付后者14.76万元股票分红。宁波英融随后提出上诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在嘉兴市中级人民法院二审过程中，方红承因涉嫌职务侵占被采取刑事强制措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;嘉兴中院认为应驳回方红承的起诉，并将有关材料移送公安机关，若经公安机关审查后认为本案确属民事纠纷的，方红承可另行主张权利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年11月29日，嘉兴中院裁定，撤销平湖法院的一审判决，驳回方红承的起诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;违规代持&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;另一起股权纠纷，直接发生在方红承与罗立国之间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年1月1日，方红承与罗立国签订《股权转让协议》，约定将后者间接持有的合盛硅业126.11万股的股权（占上市前总股本0.21%），以3.17元/股的价格转让给方红承。且方红承自愿承诺，协议签订后服务罗立国实控公司至少5年，其间不从事同业竞争业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同一日，两者还签订了《代持股权协议书》，由罗立国为方红承代持上述股份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承家属提供给南方周末记者的材料显示，合盛硅业于2011年开始启动上市工作，方红承任上市工作小组组长。 2017年春节后，&lt;span>;或是因为对方红承工作的肯定&lt;/span>;，或是担心其跳槽，罗立国提出，方红承用自己的年终奖，以公司净资产价格受让罗名下少量股权，并由罗代持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据裁判文书，2017年12月14日，方红承与罗立国又签订了新的《&lt;span>;股权转让及代持协议&lt;/span>;》，约定方红承以50元/股出让之前受让的26.11万股，总作价1305.5万元。本次转让后，方红承仍间接持有100万股合盛硅业股份，由罗立国代持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承认为，其共计间接持有140万股合盛硅业股份。因为在上述100万股的基础上，其还持有2018年合盛硅业分派的每股转增股份0.4股。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2021&lt;/span>;年4月25日，方红承就此股权转让纠纷向杭州仲裁委员会申请仲裁，要求罗立国出售140万股，&lt;span>;并将所得及相关股份&lt;/span>;2018、2019年的分红支付给自己。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;监管一贯对上市公司的股权代持问题态度严厉&lt;/span>;。杭州仲裁委援引证券法和《上市公司信息披露管理办法》，认定方红承和罗立国关于代持股份的约定无效，但其他条款仍然有效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杭州仲裁委认为，双方约定方红承于2017年1月1日起全职勤勉服务罗立国实控公司至少5年，但方红承在2018年12月7日辞职，只履行了40%的服务期承诺，所以可相应获得34.0676万股合盛硅业股份及部分2018-2020年分红款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年2月23日，杭州仲裁委裁决，罗立国将34.0676万股合盛硅业股份减持变现后扣除交易费用，连同37.67万元分红一起支付给方红承。罗立国也提出了上诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;罗立国在上诉中称，方红承违反竞业限制约定，如其从合盛硅业离职当月即入职同行业公司新亚强（603155.SH）任副总经理，持281万股。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承确实曾试图这么做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新亚强招股书显示，该公司于2018年12月20日与方红承签订劳动合同，约定在满足任职条件的情况下聘任方红承为公司副总经理。此约定在6日后的股东大会上审议通过，方红承获授激励股份281万股，以自有资金出资。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但由于方红承未能提供满足副总经理任职条件的相关文件，其自愿申请并经新亚强同意，在2018年12月30日终止了双方的劳动合同，方红承自愿转出其持有的新亚强股份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年5月23日，杭州市中级人民法院驳回了罗立国撤销仲裁裁决的申请。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合盛硅业在澄清公告中称，该裁决目前处于执行阶段，罗立国已向法院提出不予执行仲裁裁决的申请，法院尚在审理中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承在上述两起纠纷中均获部分支持，按合盛硅业当时的股价估算，方红承最多能获利8100余万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;牵出危废处理隐患&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2022年11月22日，合盛硅业公告称，公司原董事、总经理方红承因涉嫌职务侵占已由公安机关侦查终结并移送至检察机关审查起诉，其所涉犯罪行为发生在公司任职期间。该案件为公司内部自查发现并向公安机关报案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此事牵出合盛硅业危废品处理隐患。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据相关研究论文，在有机硅生产中，沸点低于40℃的副产物组成的混合物称为低沸物，其中大部分是四甲基硅烷，还有二甲基一氯硅烷、三氯硅烷、氯甲烷等。低沸物组分间沸点很接近，所以很难分离加以利用。这些化合物易燃易爆。其中，四甲基硅烷被列入国家《危险化学品名录》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合盛硅业招股书和2023年半年报均披露，副产品低沸物是该公司主要的固废，严格执行外售处理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据方红承的自述及其家属提供的材料，2011年，合盛硅业内外交困，急需进行技术改造、降低成本。因危险化学品生产技术改造涉及政府审批，罗立国决定所有新建、改建项目大干快上，和政策抢时间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承列出了8个当时违规新建、改建的项目，都是未按规定办理安评、环评等相关审批手续，大多数项目的直接经济效益都在1000万元/年以上。项目之一是在密闭系统中，对被定性为危废的低沸物进行相对安全地处置，将其变为相对稳定的“水解油”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述材料称，“水解油”是合盛硅业自己的命名，是低沸物和水反应转化成的一种腐蚀性较小、成分复杂、易燃易爆的油状危险化学品。合盛硅业仍需将“水解油”及时对外处置，否则会导致公司停产。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这项工作落到了方红承弟弟方红兴头上，“方红兴冒着违法违规，安全环保风险，与他人合作处置利用&#39;水解油&#39;并获取利益。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年4月，方红承成立了生产特种有机硅涂料的轻资产公司浙江香林新材料有限公司。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;上述材料显示，次月，合盛硅业将方红兴帮助其销售处置“水解油”的事，以罗立国不知情，方红承擅自建设等为由，指控方红承“背信损害上市公司利益”，向嘉兴港区公安分局报案。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在方红承就两起股权纠纷提起诉讼和仲裁后，2021年8月，合盛硅业以方红承涉嫌非国家工作人员受贿，第二次到港区公安分局报案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承家属举报信中附上了港区公安分局2021年12月31日作出的撤销案件决定书，称方红承涉嫌非国家工作人员受贿案没有犯罪事实，案件撤销。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，方红承和罗立国在股权纠纷诉讼中，已对“水解油”的处置问题争过几个来回。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;罗立国以一组销售合同和评估报告为证，指控方红承在职期间以不到2000元/吨的价格“贱卖”评估价格每吨越过万元的“水解油”，为其关联公司谋取巨额利益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;方红承则以邮件往来及报表为据称，其对“水解油”的生产、销售只是遵照罗立国及其他公司高层的决策执行，不是个人谋利行为。且“水解油”的生产销售活动不合法、不合规，本身不会为合盛硅业带来任何合法利益。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但法院的审理重点在两者的股权纠纷上，并未对“水解油”问题进行判决。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;公司不再搬迁&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;到了2022年6月，方红承才被港区公安分局立案。其在自述中表示，6月13日方红承兄弟俩被传唤，第二日被指定居所“监视居住”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;方红承及其家属认为，事件的变化是因罗立国以将上市公司从嘉兴市搬离至宁波市代管的县级市慈溪为由，要挟嘉兴市政府所致。 2018年嘉兴市委有关部门的相关文章显示，合盛硅业是嘉兴港区培育的首家上市公司。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合盛硅业在澄清公告中表示，公司注册地址在嘉兴，但嘉兴生产基地以化工生产设施为主，办公条件有限，所以在2022年1月公告将办公地址更改至宁波慈溪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《宁波晚报》，罗立国出生在“草帽之乡”慈溪长河镇，靠开草帽厂起家，有慈溪首富之称。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据澄清公告，为统一办公地址与注册地址，公司召开第三届董事会第十二次会议，拟变更公司地址至慈溪。后为维持相关资质登记，公司终止执行变更公司住所并取消审议该事项的股东大会。这两件事项分别在2022年5月28日和6月8日公告。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2023&lt;/span>;年5月，方红承家属向嘉兴港区应急管理局、嘉兴市应急管理局及四川省应急管理厅实名举报合盛硅业违法建设低沸水解装置，非法销售危险化学品方面的问题，获得了不同的回复&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据举报信，嘉兴港区应急管理局分三次回复称，未在现场发现水解装置，低沸物可以作为副产物销售，“水解油”未在危化品目录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;四川省应急管理厅则称，“水解油”系危险化学品，且未在合盛硅业（泸州）有限公司的安全生产许可范围，已责令该公司暂停使用“水解油”生产装置，并对该公司涉嫌安全生产违法行为进行调查。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合盛硅业对“水解油”情况澄清称，其嘉兴子公司合盛硅业（嘉兴）有限公司已办理的《危险化学品登记品种》包括低沸油（即“水解油”）。其泸州子公司合盛硅业（泸州）有限公司已办理的《危险化学品登记品种》也包括含氢硅油S。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据企查查，合盛硅业（嘉兴）有限公司设立于2020年6月29日。这意味着，合盛硅业并未回应方红承在职期间，是如何处置低沸物的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot;

&lt;p>;项飙上次回国，已是疫情前的2019年。项飙是德国马克斯·普朗克社会人类学研究所所长、英国牛津大学社会人类学教授，他曾因调研北京浙江村而成名，在海外多年后，近几年重新活跃于中文世界。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次回国，项飙频繁地跟各种人聊天，比如每次打车，他都不想错过与司机交谈的机会。在家乡温州，他发现出租车司机大多在45岁以上，一般都兼有另一份工作。有位司机告诉项飙，他帮人开信用卡，项飙就很好奇，现在移动支付这么方便，还有谁在用信用卡。司机说，有些需要小额贷款短期周转的人。而寻找开卡的客户，又涉及数据买卖的灰色链条。在广州的网约车上，聊到司机儿子的职业，他指了指车内的平台录音设备，做了个嘘的手势，对话便打住了。 “这些对我都是新的点，不知道有没有用，但能发现社会的丰富性。”项飙告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;项飙说自己是个离艺术很远的人，几乎从不看电影，也很少去美术馆和展览馆，只有一次例外，他为德国一位艺术家的申请项目做评委。 “这是德国的习惯，找一些不同学科背景的人参与评审。”他说。 “看见最初500米”工作坊，是他最深入地参与一个公共艺术和社会艺术的活动。他原本设想的是鼓励大家走向社区，走向陌生人，但一方面由于2022年疫情带来的不确定性；另一方面，许多人发现，如果把500米的半径继续缩小，他们最切身关注的，是家人和伴侣。因此，工作坊的许多作品偏移了方向。大家的焦虑，叠加了社会的和个人生命的重重投影。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何志森曾经把展览开进广州的菜市场，在华南理工大学的讲台上，他说自己办过一百多个工作坊，大多数散了就散了，“看见最初500米”的成员是联系最密切的。听说项飙专程来广州跟大家聊天，工作坊的参与者有的从南京，有的从国外，专程赶来。这天，项飙安静地坐在阶梯教室后排，像个大龄学生。他跟随工作坊成员曼曼穿过石牌村喧嚷的巷道和握手楼，来到城中村里的艺术空间。这个被称为“流动俱乐部”的空间，原本是一个垃圾回收站。项飙跟大家聊温州，聊南方，聊中国南北差异。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;以人类学理解艺术，“认得感”不同于“看得懂”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;为什么近年来当代艺术界越来越关注人类学？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我们所谓的画廊、博物馆里面收藏的精英艺术，它可以在方法、技巧和表现形式上做很多文章。但如果是公共艺术的话，你只在形式和方法上突破，对老百姓是没有意义的，别人不知道你突破个啥，不能勾起那种共振，老百姓不认得你这个究竟是怎么回事儿，跟他的生活发生不了联系，然后就不能参与，也不能进一步被激发。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个时候，公共艺术就需要思想性，要找到一个问题，然后这个问题能够用非常浓缩的艺术的方式表达出来，戏剧也好，装置也好，一幅画也好，表达出来之后，大家一方面能够认得，同时你那种表现方式又让大家看到这是一扇门，会情不自禁要打开它，门后面是一个空间。这样大家能参与到里面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的艺术作品，要有一定的思想性，要对经验有大量观察，有非常细致、真诚的咀嚼，然后升华出一个意象、一个母题、一个核心性的象征。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那为什么是人类学，而不是一般的社会科学或者心理学，来跟艺术沟通？因为人类学就是要从非常具体的经验里面，看出一些问题和道理，它不像哲学那样，从一个已有的问题，比如“什么叫好人”出发来思考；它也不像社会学，从一个宏观的社会现象来思考。人类学通过日常的行为，去看出背后的一些问题，所以人类学的“认得感”很强，老百姓一看就知道，这个是跟他有关的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;怎么理解“认得感”？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;认得，就是你看见一个东西，勾起对自己生命经验的理解，它会产生一种相互的投射。所以认得是非常重要的，我们理解世界都是要基于自己的生命经验，你调动记忆，然后去对这个东西做新的解读，这个叫认得。不懂，就是认不得。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比方说卡夫卡也好，本雅明也好，我们如果没有对欧洲文化相当的理解的话，就不能认得。其实他说的那个东西，在他的语境里面，是非常直接的，对于有类似生命经验的人，是很容易认得的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就像我们看鲁迅，今天青年人看鲁迅很难懂，也是因为不认得，这不是说你通过知识、逻辑可以解决的，当然不排除有一种纯粹字面上、逻辑上的理解，你觉得也看懂了，但完全不能调动自己的经验，（这种情况）其实是很多的，我们看一些文件都是这样的感受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有很多搞学术研究的人，搞艺术的人，其实他的理解不是基于自己的生命经验，而是在文本和文本之间建立关系，那也可以形成一种理解，或者逻辑上的解读，感觉都看懂了，但这个看懂和我们说的“认得”的效果是很不一样的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这次你在广州见到的工作坊的参与者，大多很年轻，与大家交流的过程中，你遇到了什么新鲜的刺激吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;当然有很多刺激。他（她）们不太愿意用主流的绩点主义（来生活），不一定在世俗意义上成功，有的人刚辞了职。他（她）们的背景是相当多样的，有木匠，公务员，做视频的，做营销的。学艺术的也有，不是特别多，但这些人都有一定的艺术感。艺术感的意思是，对自己的知觉比较敏感，他们不一定去思考这些敏感，但“敏感”会待在他（她）身上，有点黏着性，不会轻易地被刷掉。有艺术感的人就是敏感具有黏着性的人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作坊对我的教育很大，它使我变得更柔软，对人的主观情感赋予了更多的注意力。就像我刚讲的，这些年轻人是不太主流的，很多人都弱弱的，不太自信。有几个人在去年一开始的时候几乎是不能说话，开会的前一天没法睡觉，紧张到这个程度。之前我接触的很多年轻人，比如牛津的学生，都是侃侃而谈，牛津是有名的培养政治家的地方。但是这个工作坊的年轻人，很多表达并不连贯。这种艰难的表达，有时会变成尴尬的沉默，但是他（她）一旦讲起来，你就能感到背后有非常丰富的感受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按我以前的习惯，这种交流效率是很低的，我自己是一个比较理性的人，一直在追求清晰化。我现在意识到我原来其实是很封闭、对世界的感知是很单一的。我需要更多的耐心，这对我是一种教育。我想，在这里推进很多事，不能都要用理性的方式去做，艺术就是一个好的工具。我更多地去听，之前我对情感的丰富性、敏感性，很多混杂的说不清的东西注意得不够，现在就更重视了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“我不是一个导师，而是一个对话者”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你在讲座或网上直播中，是怎么跟观众互动的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;在演讲完之后，公众给我提的问题分两类。第一类是顺着我提出的概念问，老实说这种问题意思不是特别大，最后变成了我要对概念再做界定和解释。真正有冲击力的是第二类问题，就是非常具体地基于生活经验的发问。这种问题很难回答，但是它会给我一些冲击。比如有的家长会问我，都说内卷不好，我的孩子现在成绩越来越差，我该不该送他去搞辅导？不管我怎么回答，这个家长大概率还是会送孩子去补课。那我的回答可能是，你跟孩子互动当中，怎么去定义补课这件事，这是很关键的。我能感受到家长的焦虑和纠结，我没办法改变客观的环境，但对他比较有用和贴切的回答，是怎么去定义、陈述、对待这件事。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们可能需要区分一下思维和思想。思维是推论性的，要求逻辑的严密；思考是发散、多维的。这样的对话就让我从单向的思维向比较丰富的、对感受更敏感的思考转变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那你参加的学术性的工作坊有什么不同？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;那种工作坊都是要用非常清晰的语词去表达，把生活理论化、概念化地去讲，时间一般不会超过三天。这个“看见最初500米”完全不一样，它是开放的，没有一个固定的主题，而且是反对概念化的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;很多年轻人喜欢和你交流，而且很信赖你。你觉得自己是年轻人的导师吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这次回国我还蛮惊讶的，发现我比自己想象得要更受欢迎一点，年轻人的热切程度超出了我的想象。但是我并没有年轻人的导师的感觉。我很反感导师这样的角色，我自己作为青年人的时候，就不太去理人生导师，所以我不会变成自己讨厌的角色。我是一个对话者。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我觉得最重要的不是我告诉你应该怎么样，而是我激励你去更多地思考。我会提出一些问题，凸显一些悖论，做一些分析，促使你去思考，让我们发现原来的思考可能有些简单，这是我的工作。即使我有一些所谓建议，也是关于怎么去思考，而不是在道德上和行为上应该怎么样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;但确实很多年轻人向你提问的时候，会问关于焦虑、内卷这些问题，有一种期待你做人生导师的感觉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我不这么看。他们在朋友聚会也会互相问这些问题的，会说内卷“卷”成这样了，我该怎么办？这些问题不仅朋友间会问，亲戚间会问，晚上睡不着觉的时候也会问自己。我觉得可能那个问题占据了他的脑子，会自然地出来，所以他会向所有人问那个问题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有趣的是，我怎么去接这样的问题。他知道我不会给他一个答案，不能为他引一条路。大多数人不会这么想。他其实问的是，一个已知无解的问题，应该怎么去面对。所以我把自己放在他那个情况下，理解他的处境，带着真诚去回应，这可能是比较有效的。这完全就是朋友式的交流，不是导师和被指导的关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《把自己作为方法》这本书很畅销，这可能也是年轻人从你这里受到启发的原因。作为一个人类学家，为什么近几年来你会比较乐意接受访谈，或者在大众媒体上出场？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;19、20世纪，社会科学刚刚出现的时候，世界跟今天很不一样，当时学者与非学者的区别在当时非常大。比如欧洲的一个学者，要学习古希腊文、拉丁文、各种哲学，中国的学者梁启超、严复这些人首先引进社会科学，大部分民众是目不识丁的。但是21世纪，我们的青年受教育的程度，他的思考和掌握知识的能力、他的信息，跟学者没什么区别。而且我们往往觉得高手在民间，现在B站上的一些东西，其实比很多学院里的学者写得有趣。这就意味着学术研究不能在像19、20世纪那样，从自己的学术命题出发，写篇文章两三百人看一下，公众不知道怎么回事，那不行。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以我在德国的工作，就是要倡导一种新的研究风格，不是从学术命题出发，而是从公众的焦虑本身出发，把“焦虑”作为题目，来共同研究。或者说，是对话式研究。每个人有自己的生命、自己的挣扎，它里面的味道，和我们在外面猜猜看看不一样。我们的输出应该是如何应对这个世界，给出思考的方法、概念和理论的视角，引起更多的讨论。对于对话式研究来说，在公众媒体上交流就非常重要，这是我的工作方法，不是辅助性，而是根本性的工作方法。不是我有什么结论要告诉大家，而是在不断的往复中，碰撞和深化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这种对话、往复中，你收到过什么形式的反馈？毕竟你也没在B站开账号，反馈不是用弹幕给出来的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我发现当代艺术特别敏感，2020年国内有四个展览以“附近”为题目。其实“附近”从学理上讲，是个很含糊的东西，我原来自己也没有觉得很有趣，只是一般性地提一下。 “附近”这个概念收到的是热情的反馈。我提出“乡绅”这个说法，收到的反馈就没那么热情，更多是疑问和批判性的。还有些话题我觉得有趣，但公众的反应一般。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有人会在网上找到我的Email给我写信。并不是他提出的问题本身有什么意思，而是我会去思考，他为什么提出这样的问题，我就知道有些问题是具有普遍性的，我还要经过一段时间去观察。所以反馈不是直接给我的，需要一个过程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;共同的焦虑与16型人格&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;回国这段时间，你几乎每天在高强度地跟各种人聊天，你一直这么健谈吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;没有测过。我不是一个性格上很外向的人，有时候有一点社恐，很长时间对人的主观情感都不敏感。甚至我一直觉得自己有轻度的自闭症，我看牛津的一个分析哲学家的传记，他经常跟别人说话，但是大家发现，他对很多常识性的东西是无感的，对人际关系的理解非常简单，但对有些东西的分析又可以非常深刻，我觉得这好像跟我很像。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老实说我是比较内向的，比较怕和很多以一起吃饭。那种场合的聊天，很少有人能够完整地讲他的经历，谈话的内容很容易变成各种片段、八卦、极端的故事，很多是道听途说的。我惊讶的是很多知识精英也爱讲这些。在那种环境下，我就很难维持自己，变得非常安静，想快点结束。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在中国年轻人很流行聊16型人格，大家经常互相问“你是I人还是E人”，你怎么看这个现象？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;人格分类是个很有趣的现象，它跟年轻人原来对心理学的好奇还不太一样，不仅仅是想了解自己的心理状态，认识自我，它现在主要是一种社交工具，互相知道对方的类型，然后互相画像，然后互相提问，但这个提问其实不一定是说要（根据对方的人格类型）对症下药，而是说没办法用一种自然的话语开始沟通，用人格分类就可以比较安心地去聊。这和社交媒体的作用很有关系，我们习惯与人设，也就是类型的人、画像中的人互动，但是不太知道怎么和人本身互动。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在大多数学术研究是围绕着课题走，你用这样的方式来进行对话，研究共同的焦虑，你觉得自己是一个幸运的人吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我是非常幸运，我在牛津本来就很幸运的，到了德国马普所，对我的约束就更少，而且给了一个平台，鼓励你做一些奇怪的事情。在“共同的焦虑”这个方向，我们有博士后在非洲做“压力”，有人在拉美做“执著”，在什么样的具体生活情况下，人们会对什么问题，以什么方式做执著的投入，这可以让我们学到什么。这跟哲学讨论不一样，是很现实的观察。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;为什么你会特别重视“焦虑”？为什么会从“共同的焦虑”，而不是比如说“共同的关切”出发，来进行对话式研究？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;公众关切的东西往往是受一种主流话语形塑的，容易用一些数据直接去表达。关切是一体化、概念化的。焦虑带着情绪性，更接近生命体验本身。对老百姓来说，生活的目的不是批判，而是生活得更好。当然有很多东西值得批判，但要从他生活的目的里面出来，批判才会落到实处，便于他们的行动，然后可以在看起来不可改变的结构之下改变生活，改变人们的思考。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究焦虑，要比研究公众的关切，或者某一个议题，难得多得多，因为焦虑这个东西很模糊，讲不清楚，没法定义，更不用说定量了。这就意味着我们必须找到新的语言、新的思想方法。跟着议题走很容易，但创新也很难。但是从焦虑出发，就更能抓住当下的新的矛盾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“焦虑”是近几年持续很久的一个热词，对大家焦虑的状况，你有什么观察？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;项飙：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;焦虑的状况比我想象得还要严重，很弥漫性的。本来从报道上就能看到现在心理疾病的高发，然后通过跟年轻人的对话，与各种各样的人聊天、接触，我就更加从经验层面看到大家怎么去描述焦虑，焦虑是如何蔓延的，包括亲密关系当中，焦虑被放大或被扭曲。同时，大家意识到自己在焦虑，这就意味着大家在期待一种改变，至少期待一种更好的回应自己处境的方式。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;焦虑的一个原因是我们对生活的感知的断裂。当生活出现了极大的摇摆，摇摆之后如果没有充分的讨论和沟通，那对老百姓来讲，就没法对事情的发展形成完整的理解。这里面肯定有各种各样的创伤，这个创伤留在自己身上，我们如果处理不好，它会一直留下来，变成我们今后的恐惧、无力、神经过敏、激烈的反应等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经常有人问我，你为什么不批判？其实批判还是很重要，但我把更多的注意力放在分析我们身上的创伤，我们怎么对待它，怎么去保存自己的力量。 &lt;/p>;

Yang Huiyan, the &quot;tenth consecutive winner&quot; as the richest woman, dropped to fifth place; nearly 60 of the 50 female entrepreneurs on the list started from scratch, and real estate is still their largest source of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 14, Hurun Research Institute and the Business Women&#39;s Growth and Social Platform Hong Kong Beauty Club jointly released the &quot;2023 Hong Kong Beauty Club·Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List&quot;) as shown above information. This is the eighteenth consecutive time that Hurun Research Institute has released this list, and the deadline for wealth calculation is September 1, 2023. Unlike the Hurun Rich List, the list of female entrepreneurs separately calculates the personal wealth of female entrepreneurs that can be separated from family wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;94-year-old &quot;No. 1 Tenant&quot; Kuang Xiaoqing became the richest woman in China&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &quot;In the past 18 years, the threshold for the top 50 Chinese female entrepreneurs has increased from 500 million to 13.5 billion , increased nearly 30 times.&quot; Hurun Report, chairman and chief research officer of Hurun Report, said above. However, judging from the Hurun Report&#39;s overall list, the proportion of female entrepreneurs dropped by 1.3 percentage points to 25.4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List shows that 94-year-old Kuang Xiaoqing became the richest woman in China for the first time with a wealth of 72 billion yuan. She is also the sixth richest woman in China in the past 18 years on the Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List. The top five are Zhang Yin (three times) ), Yang Huiyan (ten times), Wu Yajun (twice), Zhou Qunfei (once), Chen Lihua (once). Wu Yajun, the founder of Longfor Real Estate, remains the richest self-made woman in China with 66.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/3eaa8871e004d592302015eeabe4487e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/3eaa8871e004d592302015eeabe4487e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258386&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;(Hurun Female Entrepreneurs List TOP10, Source: Hurun Report)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Kuang Xiaoqingsheng Born in Huashan Town, Huadu District, Guangdong Province in 1929, she is the wife of Hong Kong entrepreneur and founder of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Kwok Desheng, with a total wealth of 72 billion yuan. She is also the largest shareholder of Sun Hung Kai Properties. She is highly respected in the family and is the soul of Sun Hung Kai Properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Hung Kai Properties is one of the largest real estate developers in Hong Kong. According to data from Sun Hung Kai Properties in fiscal year 2023 (July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023), the company’s operating income was HK$71.2 billion. Net profit attributable to the parent company was HK$23.91 billion, with a net profit margin of 34.52%, a year-on-year increase of 2.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kuang Xiaoqing is known as &quot;China&#39;s No. 1 Housekeeper&quot;. Judging from the financial reports of Sun Hung Kai Properties in the past five years, property rental has always contributed the largest proportion of revenue, about one-third. Judging from the latest financial report, as of June 30, 2023, Sun Hung Kai Properties&#39; land bank in Hong Kong is approximately 58 million square feet (approximately 5.38 million square meters), of which more than 60% are diversified properties, most of which are used for Leasing and long-term investment bring considerable recurring income to the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hurun Report, Kuang Xiaoqing became the richest woman in China for the first time, mainly benefiting from the rise in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate this year and company dividends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the rise in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, since the beginning of this year, the RMB exchange rate against the Hong Kong dollar has risen from around 0.8 to around 0.9, with a maximum of around 0.93. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the company&#39;s dividends, Flush shows that Sun Hung Kai Properties is one of the blue-chip stocks that have been purchased the most by domestic investors, with a cumulative cash distribution of HK$71.72 billion in the past five years. In fiscal year 2023 (July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023), the company will distribute cash twice, with an amount of HK$14.34 billion, and a dividend payout ratio of 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that in the latest fiscal year (dividend payment date is November 16), Sun Hung Kai Properties paid a dividend of HK$3.7 per share, which was three times the dividend of the previous fiscal year. Kwong Xiaoqing personally holds less than 0.01% of Sun Hung Kai Properties, which is 25,020 shares. Kwong Xiaoqing and his immediate family members jointly hold 19.5% of Sun Hung Kai Properties&#39; shares, totaling 565 million shares. Based on a dividend payout of HK$3.7 per share, Kuang Xiaoqing’s personal shareholding and the shareholding jointly held with others will make a profit of approximately HK$2.091 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The ranking of &quot;Ten Crowns&quot; Yang Huiyan dropped to fifth place&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In this list, another major focus is the substantial wealth of Yang Huiyan, who has won the title of the richest woman ten times. Shrunk, ranking fell to fifth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the changes in the Hurun Women Entrepreneurs list, Country Garden Chairman and Executive Director Yang Huiyan’s wealth has shrunk the most in 2023 compared to last year (27 billion yuan), ranking 5th with 48 billion yuan; followed by It is Cheng Xue, CEO of Haitian Flavor Industry, whose performance has declined due to the additive incident, and his wealth has shrunk by 16.5 billion yuan; and Zhao Yan, chairman of Bloomage International Investment Group, the &quot;Queen of Hyaluronic Acid&quot;, whose wealth has shrunk by 14.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Born in 1981, Yang Huiyan is the second daughter of Country Garden founder Yang Guoqiang. In 2005, Yang Huiyan returned to China after graduating from the Ohio State University majoring in marketing and logistics, and joined Country Garden as Yang Guoqiang&#39;s personal assistant and served as purchasing manager. She has held important positions in Country Garden Investment Center, Procurement Department, Human Resources Center, Digital Management Center and other departments. In March 2023, Yang Huiyan officially became the successor of the family business and served as the chairman of the board of directors of Country Garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2007, Country Garden was listed in Hong Kong, and Yang Guoqiang transferred all his shares to Yang Huiyan. 26-year-old Yang Huiyan topped the 2007 Forbes rich list with $16.02 billion, and became China&#39;s new richest woman. In the 16 years from 2007 to 2022, Yang Huiyan aspired to be the richest woman in China ten times. It is worth noting that Yang Huiyan’s wealth has shrunk by nearly 60% year-on-year in 2022, but she still ranks first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/e2b3c063491daeb6cf2b77ab07539ef4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/e2b3c063491daeb6cf2b77ab07539ef4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258388&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Yang Huiyan aspired to be the richest woman in China ten times, source: Hurun Report)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Huiyan’s wealth has shrunk and Country Garden Crisis is closely related. In 2023, due to increasing uncertainty in the macro economy and real estate, Country Garden&#39;s debt has frequently shown red lights. &quot;Faced with the two-way tightening on the consumer side and the financing side, the group&#39;s liquidity is under unprecedented pressure.&quot; Country Garden said in its 2023 mid-term report. From Country Garden&#39;s annual and interim reports for the past five years, we can find that Country Garden&#39;s strategic goals have changed from prudent and pragmatic replenishment of high-quality land reserves to &quot;guaranteing the delivery of buildings&quot; and making every effort to arrange debt repayments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 30, 2023, Country Garden Services (6098.HK) announced that Yang Huiyan, the company’s controlling shareholder, non-executive director and chairman of the board of directors, donated RMB 64 million to Guoqiang Charity Foundation (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. HK$100 million worth of stocks will be used for charity. But this move caused controversy in the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Hurun Women Entrepreneurs List shows that the number of new female billionaires on the list is 8, which is the lowest in 18 years and 3 less than last year.

For example, Wu Yajun of Longhu, Chen Lihua of Fuhua and Wang Laichun of Luxshare Precision, Fan Hongwei of Hengli, Guan Yamei of Tongwei and Pan Dong of Blue Moon, etc. Non-self-made female entrepreneurs, on the one hand, inherit wealth, such as Zong Fuli of Wahaha, Yang Huiyan of Country Garden, etc.; on the other hand, they are the widows of entrepreneurs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of age, the average age of self-made female entrepreneurs is about 59 years old, and the average age of successors is 54 years old. &amp;nbsp;The wealth of the 7 post-80s generation on the list is all inherited.

He is a capable person, with great strength and a sharp mind. He can handle all kinds of farm work with ease. He can adapt immediately to work in the city. From skills to interpersonal skills, he can handle it with ease, making money and gaining popularity. Therefore, his family has the most prosperous life in the village and can be called the &quot;richest man&quot;. He is a person who &quot;stamps his feet in the east of the village and trembles in the west of the village&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often said that he had not studied for a few days and had not received any advanced education, but his life was better than others. Go to school and study, and ultimately you have to live a good life. As long as you live a good life, don&#39;t care too much whether you get an education or not. Therefore, when other families were worried about their children&#39;s poor grades, the third uncle was very indifferent and didn&#39;t care about his cousin&#39;s grades. He didn&#39;t praise his cousin if he got 100 points in the exam, and he didn&#39;t beat or scold him if he failed. He told his son, How many points you earn is not a matter of ability, the key is being able to make money. Uncle San has this attitude towards school education and instills this into family education - as long as you master the ability to make money, you will win. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My third uncle is very disdainful of those families that invest too much money and energy in education, especially my family. Although the tuition fees at that time were not high, they were still a big burden for rural families. Before the start of each school year, many parents were worried about the tuition fees, and it would even take a long time after the school started to raise the funds. Uncle San didn’t understand the idea of ​​collecting tuition fees. Since he had no money, why would he still go to school? He went to elementary school, middle school, and university. After graduation, if he didn’t find a job or the job was not good, he would have to invest more than ten dollars. Wasn’t the money spent in the year wasted? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, I performed abnormally in the high school entrance examination and felt that I could not reach the admission score. I was very depressed and lost. My relatives and friends could not come to comfort me. Only my third uncle came over and told me, don’t worry. In the worst case, I would learn to repair cars with him. Studying is easy and you can make money. It made me dumbfounded. Fortunately, it was just a false alarm. A month later, I successfully entered high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to differences in educational concepts, the relationship between father and third uncle is very delicate. The two brothers often quarrel over this difference when eating and drinking, and break up on bad terms. My father was firm at first and kept encouraging me, saying that I should study even though I was selling everything. But as his cousin entered the society, his father&#39;s heart was shaken. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the neglect of his third uncle, his cousin barely survived until he graduated from junior high school. Then he refused to go to school and wanted to go out to the city to try his luck. The third uncle expressed his support and entrusted him to a do-it-yourselfer. Relatives take care of business. The third uncle gave his cousin a sum of money and asked him to make the first pot of gold by himself. My cousin is not very old, but he has inherited the talents of his third uncle. Before he was 18 years old, he was already prosperous in the city, and at least he started taking money from the family. And I was still &quot;burning money&quot; in college at that time. Every time I came home for vacation, my father would always talk about the legend of my cousin getting rich, and his tone was full of admiration. Later, he gradually expressed his blame for my slow success in studying, from sighing to complaining, which made me afraid to appear at the same time as my cousin. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reversal occurred in my second year on the job. My cousin started to get into debt. He liked to make rapid progress in business. In addition, he entered the society at an early age and gained stubborn self-confidence. He turned a deaf ear to the old man&#39;s advice. Moving money here and there and negotiating in the west have become the norm, and we are gradually unable to make ends meet. At first, the third uncle felt that the family was rich and the loss was nothing. But when he realized that something was wrong, it was too late. The cousin’s debts spanned both black and white, including relatives and friends. He was unable to repay them, so he owed it to the stronger third uncle. On the head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After going bankrupt, only one-tenth of the debt was paid. The third uncle, who has become a grandfather and enjoys his old age, decided to start over. He took up the craftsmanship of his youth and worked two or three jobs at the same time. He works hard and makes money to pay off his debts with amazing perseverance. Relatives&#39; debts, bank loans... one after another, all relied on him and his third aunt to support the repayment. The cousin, who was used to wallowing in money, couldn&#39;t accept the life without money. He just settled down after falling into debt. His parents had to bear the huge burden. Even his own son was taken care of by an old man while working. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has been going on for ten years, and the debt has finally been repaid. I haven&#39;t changed much, I just keep going to and from get off work. The ones who have changed are my father and my third uncle. My father began to be grateful for his investment in education. Although I did not earn much money, I learned to be steady and not easy to &quot;learn bad things&quot;, and he believed in me more than before. The third uncle began to repeat, &quot;How good it is to study.&quot; Education costs money, but the money is worth spending, because those who study have a &quot;doorkeeper&quot; and something to pull them when doing things, and they will not keep &quot;stepping on the accelerator&quot;. &quot;, no matter what. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I gradually understood that although education is not a panacea, it may not be able to directly solve very real problems such as employment and making money. But nothing is possible without education. We often think of education and society as a cause-and-effect relationship. Education must be responsible for what we can do when we enter society, otherwise it will be useless. In fact, a major function of education is to be responsible for what you do not do when you enter society. You should not just focus on &quot;doing something&quot;, but also pay attention to &quot;doing something not to do.&quot; Through the words of the third uncle, I think that regardless of family education, school education, or social education, if you focus on using education as the &quot;gas pedal&quot; for profit, you will definitely lose control. In an increasingly &quot;fast&quot; era, education is needed as the &quot;brake&quot; role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a Changchun media person)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;span>; 163.com)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[千年造像被“毁容”，只为他们还个愿？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260666]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 16:29:19&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently, a cliff was excavated in Nanjiang County, Bazhong, Sichuan more than 1,400 years ago in the late Northern Wei Dynasty.

The subsequent report concluded that:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; &quot;Cliff statues were rarely excavated in the late Northern Wei Dynasty, and were continued in the early Tang &lt;span>;, Wu Zhou and middle and late Tang dynasties. The excavation date was early and the formation process was complicated. The entire natural stone package on the ground was excavated into a stele for the statue. The characteristic practice is an isolated example in Sichuan.

Psychotropic drugs that make humanoids addictive constitute the crime of drug trafficking. In the first instance, he was sentenced to two months&#39; detention, suspended for three months, and fined RMB 1,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liao Hua said that after the verdict of the first instance was announced, the more she thought about it, the more aggrieved she became. Previously, she only thought that she was violating laws and regulations by selling prescription drugs, but she did not expect that it would be a serious criminal charge such as &quot;drug trafficking&quot;. Since her job is administrative accounting, the criminal stain will greatly affect her career development. Liao Hua chose to appeal. At the end of October 2023, the second instance of the case was heard in Binzhou Intermediate Court, and no verdict has been announced yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 13, the judge in charge of the Binzhou Intermediate Court case told Southern Weekend reporters that the court will conduct an investigation in accordance with legal provisions, and the direction and progress of the investigation will be determined during the trial. It won&#39;t be announced until it&#39;s over. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Both drugs and drugs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liao Hua said that the drugs he sold were all leftovers taken by his father before his death. Liao Hua&#39;s father suffered from advanced rectal cancer. During the treatment, he often suffered fractures and suffered severe pain. The hospital prescribed many types of painkillers. After his father died of a serious illness, Liao Hua didn&#39;t know what to do with the leftover medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2023, Liao Hua entered a &quot;patients exchange residual medicine transfer group&quot; through the introduction of patients, and transferred his father&#39;s remaining 15 medicines to treat COVID-19, joint pain, etc. Put the medicines together, take photos and send them to the WeChat group. At that time, a person nicknamed &quot;Xiao Wang&quot; in the group quickly added Liao Hua and sent a private message to inquire about purchasing tramalin hydrochloride and telenine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liao Hua told Southern Weekend reporters that after the accident, she noticed that although people in the group often switched to drugs, most of them were anti-cancer and chemotherapy drugs, which were relatively small. Painkillers are less common. The three boxes of tramalin hydrochloride and two boxes of Telenine that she resold to Xiao Wang for 260 yuan were &quot;other narcotic drugs and psychotropic drugs controlled by the state that can induce humanoid addiction.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On July 14, 2023, after receiving the express delivery, Xiao Wang drove to the local police station, reporting that he had purchased the national drug online without a prescription. Controlled drugs, “These are narcotics and can also be regarded as drugs.” The police&#39;s transcript of their inquiry showed that Xiao Wang was a drug addict in Yangxin County, Shandong Province. He had &quot;skated on the ice&quot; (smoked methamphetamine) before and wanted to use these drugs as a substitute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tang Jianbin, a lawyer at Beijing Jingdu Law Firm who has long represented drug criminal cases, told Southern Weekend reporters that the national drug control targets include heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and other traditional drugs. In addition, there is also a type of &quot;narcotic drugs&quot; that have both medicinal properties and drug properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tang Jianbin introduced that in judicial practice, to judge whether it is a &quot;drug&quot;, we must first check whether the substance is in the list of nationally controlled anesthetic drugs, that is, the national The latest &quot;Catalogue of Narcotic Drugs&quot;, &quot;Catalog of Psychotropic Drugs&quot; and &quot;Supplementary Catalog of Controlled Varieties of Non-Medicinal Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Drugs&quot; released by the Food and Drug Administration, the Ministry of Public Security and the National Health Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporter checked and found that these lists are dynamically updated. For example, codeine in cough drops is an analgesic, but due to its addiction Sex, as early as 2000, there was an addiction to cough drops. Relevant departments have successively issued a series of regulations, requiring &quot;sales based on prescriptions&quot;, &quot;sales and purchases in appropriate amounts&quot; and &quot;monitoring of flows&quot;; in 2015, codeine-containing compound oral liquid preparations were included in the second category of psychotropic drug control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The tramalin hydrochloride resold by Liao Hua this time is a central analgesic, mostly used for various postoperative pain relief, cancer pain, labor pain, etc. treat. Excessive use can cause bradycardia, convulsions, respiratory depression and coma, and is addictive. In 2008, tramadol (including its salts, single preparations and possible isomers) was included in the Class II psychotropic drugs for control. However, tramadol’s compound preparations will only be included in the Class II psychotropic drugs on July 1, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tylenine (oxycodone tablets), another drug resold by Liao Hua, is a compound preparation of oxycodone and is also widely used clinically. Analgesic drugs were included in the management of Class II psychotropic drugs on September 1, 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After July 1, 2023, the nationally controlled varieties of anesthetic drugs and non-medicinal anesthetic drugs have reached 456 types and 2 entire categories (fentanyl, nicotine and synthetic cannabinoids). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Listed&quot; means that tramalin hydrochloride and oxycodone paracetamol have dual properties of drugs and drugs. &quot;The first is the nature of drugs,&quot; Tang Jianbin explained. The listing of these anesthetic drugs does not automatically equate to drugs. They will only become &quot;drugs&quot; if they flow into the illegal drug market or are smoked by drug addicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In accordance with the relevant provisions of the &quot;2023 National Court Drug Crime Trial Work Conference Minutes&quot; (Kunming Conference Minutes) issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court on June 26, 2023, knowingly Criminals or drug addicts who smuggle or sell drugs and sell narcotic drugs or psychotropic drugs that are controlled by the state and have legal medical or other uses shall be convicted and punished for the crime of drug trafficking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the minutes of the Kunming meeting, &quot;there is definite evidence to prove that for the purpose of treating diseases and other related purposes&quot;, those who privately operate anesthetic drugs with legal medical purposes are not allowed to Punished as a drug crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, whether Liao Hua still sold tramalin hydrochloride and paracetamol and oxycodone even though he knew that the other party was a drug addict has become the key to the case. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73518&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70320&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/15/3af0ad6d97.jpeg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG3215.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Chat records between Liao Hua and drug buyers.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Is it &quot;fishing for law enforcement&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the process of purchasing drugs online, Xiao Wang once revealed that he was a drug addict. The chat records between the two parties show that Xiao Wang once said: &quot;I used to skate, but now I can&#39;t buy it. I use these medicines instead! I&#39;m still a little addicted now! It&#39;s too hard to quit.&quot; Liao Hua did not reply immediately, and Xiao Wang later mentioned To: &quot;I&#39;m not sick. I used to play music and smoke marijuana, but it&#39;s hard to find it now! Use this medicine to replace it!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liao Hua argued, She didn’t know what “skating” meant, and her understanding of tramalin hydrochloride and telenine had always been limited to painkillers. She didn&#39;t pay attention to the words Xiao Wang said about addiction and difficulty in quitting.在寄出药品后，她还建议小王如果有疼痛，可以试一下中医的针灸，这是她此前照顾父亲时的止痛经验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;湖北今天律师事务所律师付成晨认为，该案的关键在于能否认定明知“毒品”。廖华上述说法可以作为辩护理由，但客观上廖华实施了贩卖“毒品”的行为，且其转卖的是父亲自己使用过的药，她对药效是十分清楚的，甚至可能在医生开药过程中对管制处方药性质有一定了解。要认定其“不明知”是毒品，还需看进一步的证据材料，以及法官的裁量。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据廖华提供的另一份聊天记录，她还给一位已手术的胃癌患者转赠了芬太尼止疼贴，对方表示感谢。廖华称自己本意是病友互助，不是专门卖药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;而在该案案发一个月后，曾联系廖华买药的小王，再次在微信群中想要加转让药品的群友。廖华注意到，该群友转让的药物合照里也包含盐酸曲马林缓释片。她怀疑此人在“钓鱼”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;汤建彬分析，吸毒人员在转药群里购买替代药品时，主动表明自己吸毒的行为不大符合常理。而在本案中，这几句话恰恰构成了廖华犯贩毒罪的关键。需要考量这一做法是否有“犯意引诱”的嫌疑，即当事人本身没有这个犯罪意愿，特殊人员诱导其犯罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;根据昆明会议纪要，隐匿身份人员存在“犯意引诱”的情况下获得的证据材料应予以排除。排除上述证据后，在案证据达不到认定被引诱人有罪的证明标准的，应当依法作出证据不足、指控的犯罪不能成立的无罪判决。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但目前，廖华质疑的“钓鱼执法”并无确切证据。在相关笔录中，举报人是主动开车到派出所报案，并未提及是警方线人等身份。南方周末记者数次联系小王，未获回复。 11月13日，阳信县公安局工作人员表示由于案件正在二审，相关信息不便透露。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;付成晨提醒，没有取得药品经营许可证，是不允许私下转卖药品的；转卖管制药品涉刑，转卖一般药品情节严重也涉刑，数额未达到刑事立案标准的，也会面临行政处罚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在病友群里，有人转发了廖华的案件报道后，群公告上写到：“各位病友、病友家属，止疼药国家严格管控，含有毒品成分，私自交易买卖，属于违法犯罪，轻者拘留取保候审，重者判刑，敬请大家遵纪守法！”&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;元首外交是中美关系的“指南针”和“定盘星”，中美各界和国际社会也因此对这次旧金山会晤倍加期待，期待中美关系在元首外交战略引领下尽快回到健康稳定发展的正轨。在此关键节点，新华社推出“推动中美关系回归正轨”系列评论报道，呼吁美方同中方相向而行，克服干扰、排除障碍、积累成果、营造氛围，共同推动中美关系重回健康稳定发展轨道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;一论回归元首共识：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;重返巴厘岛、通往旧金山&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/81189d3f04a246747fbb029002acbbe4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot;

&lt;p>;只有重返巴厘岛，才能通往旧金山，重返巴厘岛是基础、是前提。最近一段时间，中美关系之所以出现一些积极迹象，正是因为对两国元首巴厘岛会晤共识的跟进和落实得到了提速。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;希望美方在近期中美互动中所展现的积极姿态不是政治算计和战术投机，所作出的口头承诺能够成为具体政策和实质行动。也希望美方能够不被国内党争羁绊和政客私利左右，同中方共同行动、持久努力，让中美关系中的好消息、好势头不断累积，推动两国关系真正稳下来、好起来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为世界上最重要的一组双边关系，中美关系牵动着人类的前途命运。巴厘岛会晤时，习近平主席强调应从把握世界大势的高度看待和处理中美关系。世界大势是什么？是和平、发展、合作、共赢成为时代潮流，任何国家或国家集团都再也无法单独主宰世界事务；是全球南方全面开启“大觉醒”时代，人类社会加速进入多极化世界；是人类越来越成为你中有我、我中有你的命运共同体，同时也面临着诸多全球性挑战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;二论校准关系航向：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;中美必须找到正确的相处之道&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/0ac4418ea1390505b89c25926818c887.png&quot;

data-key=&quot;258351&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为两个世界大国，中美能否确立正确相处之道，攸关世界和平发展和人类前途命运。一段时间以来，两国关系的变化牵动世界人心，其跌宕起伏的曲折历程，一方面表明了中美关系的严峻性和复杂性，确立大国正确相处之道并非易事，其间会受到各种因素的影响扰动；另一方面，双方最终排除干扰达成“重返巴厘岛”“面向旧金山”的重要共识也再一次证明，只要本着对历史、对世界、对人民负责的态度，对彼此树立正确理性的认知，对改善关系抱持最大诚意，中美关系就能朝着积极的方向发展，真正实现稳下来、好起来，回归健康稳定发展的正轨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于中美如何正确相处，习近平主席早已给出了明确答案，那就是相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢。这三大原则，是审视中美关系半个多世纪风云跌宕得出的重要论断，是当今时代大国之间彼此交往的正确之道，是保证中美两艘巨轮不偏航、不失速、不相撞的重要航标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有尊重，就谈不上信任；没有信任，就无法避免冲突，也谈不上真正的合作。这是中美交往积累的重要经验，也是双边关系重回正轨的基本前提。守住和平底线，这是中美必须做出的正确抉择。合作共赢是中美关系半个世纪以来的真实叙事，也是双方应当继续争取的共同目标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从巴厘岛一路走来，中美关系回暖来之不易，值得倍加珍惜。面向旧金山，双方应从过往汲取现实的启迪，汇聚相向而行的力量，共同探索构建新时代的中美关系，创造中美两国的美好未来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;三论正确定义关系：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;竞争对抗不符合时代潮流&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/3d831fec756e7799ca88717c940571ca.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot;

&lt;p>;作为两个大国，中美在贸易、技术、外交等领域既有合作也有竞争，不是你输我赢、你死我活，而应当是你追我赶、共同进步。中国不回避竞争、不惧怕竞争，但竞争应该是公平、合理、良性的，有红线、有禁区，不能无视市场经济规则和国际关系基本准则，更不能将核心利益问题作为竞争工具、挑衅手段。中国认为的竞争，应该是田径赛，有赛道有规则，可以在你追我赶中提升各自成绩，就像运动员竞技追求的是不断提升自己、突破自我，取得更好成绩，而不是给其他运动员“使绊子”或恶意干扰，否则只会因为违规而被罚出局。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;竞争更不是中美关系的全部。中美经济互补性远大于竞争性，中美经贸合作的本质是互利共赢。当前形势下，中美共同利益不是减少了，而是更多了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美作为两个大国，对人类繁荣发展担负着重要责任。通过合作共同开启人类发展的新纪元，还是滑入大国冲突对抗的深渊，是两国必须回答好的世纪之问。跳出谁赢谁输的狭隘视角，追求人类一起赢的高尚目标，应该成为新时代中美两国的共同追求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;四论增进合作共识：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;地球容得下中美各自发展、共同繁荣&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/bbf6559966456f470c67eaca5d5e8e57.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;258348&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近一段时间以来，中美正向互动趋势不断增强。美国一方面在“竞争”意识主导下继续推出对华科技、经贸合作限制措施，一方面也在各个渠道寻求与中国接触，出现了近年鲜见的“求同”苗头。究其根本，中美是全球最大的两个经济体，中美关系是全世界最重要的双边关系，两国经济关联既深且广，两国和世界都无法承受双方误判意图、对抗冲突之重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美双方的发展进步完全可以成为对方的机遇而不是挑战，两国经济互补性远大于竞争性，中美应该互利共赢而不是零和博弈，双方可以彼此成就，做大共同利益的蛋糕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美合作不仅有存量优势，还有增量优势。中美虽然互为重要贸易伙伴，每年有数千亿美元的贸易额，但双边贸易额仍然有增长空间，这是美国与其他国家双边经贸关系无法比拟的。合作将为双方开辟更多更宽广领域增长空间。 “碳中和”领域技术研发交流和联合投资将使双方受益；未来中美老龄化人群对医疗服务的需求将大幅增长，医疗技术和数据的交流将给双方带来巨大价值；中国超大规模中等收入人群为美国农产品提供难以估量的潜在市场；美中两国都受益于双向投资流，鼓励相互投资将多角度反哺两国经济……双方合作的单子可以拉得很长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宽广的地球完全容得下中美各自发展、共同繁荣。中国人民和美国人民一样，都是自尊自信自强的人民，都拥有追求美好生活的权利，两国之间存在的共同利益应该得到重视，各自取得成功对彼此都是机遇而非威胁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;五论夯实民意基础：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;汇聚中美交流合作的正能量&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/817b7b6597dfe47c2b5300188083c049.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot;

&lt;p>;在中美关系处于关键十字路口的当下，持续不断的民间交往和人文交流合作尤显珍贵，为两国关系的健康发展注入源源不断的正能量。横跨太平洋的航班越多、货轮越多、游客越多、学生学者越多，中美两国关系发展的民意基础就越厚实，空间就越广阔，动力就越强劲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美都应该本着对两国人民负责任的态度，从两国人民的福祉出发，处理好、管控好、发展好两国关系，为两国人民继承和弘扬珍贵友谊遗产创造有利氛围和条件，筑牢两国友谊与合作的民意基础。近期中美关系“大气候”回暖，越来越多的中美各界人士为两国扩大交往合作鼓与呼，为两国人民相知相亲四处奔走，传递出中美民间友好的积极信息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美关系眼下仍面临不少困难和挑战，稳定和改善两国关系任重道远。所幸的是，从历史中走来的这些根基性民间纽带仍在，推动中美关系向前发展的正能量正在不断聚集。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
