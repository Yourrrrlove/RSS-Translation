Pictures and texts are irrelevant. Yi Haifei China News Service Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-October 2023, the incident of a child in Tianjin being &quot;killed by opening the door&quot; and then being run over by a bus attracted attention. While riding an electric bicycle to carry her daughter, a woman hit the newly opened door of a passenger bus on the side of the road. The child fell to the ground and was crushed to death by the wheels of a passing bus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is another &quot;open door killing&quot; case. Southern Weekend reporters searched the relevant judicial documents website and found that in recent years, &quot;open door killing&quot; accidents have occurred frequently. Dai Xianfeng, secretary-general of the Legal Affairs Committee of the China Communications and Transportation Association, believes that with the substantial growth of private cars and non-motor vehicles, the public generally lacks awareness of the dangers of &quot;opening the door to kill&quot;, resulting in the frequent occurrence of such accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Xianfeng told Southern Weekend reporters that door-opening killings are mainly divided into two types: one is when the driver opens the door himself and collides with a non-motorized vehicle, in which case the driver bears full responsibility; If a passenger opens the door and collides with a non-motor vehicle, the passenger will generally constitute a joint tort with the driver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latter situation can be subdivided into different accident types, and the final liability for compensation will also be different. Two common situations are: the driver and the passenger have an operational relationship, such as taxis, online ride-hailing and other passenger-carrying activities; the driver and the passenger are friends or relatives, and there is no operational relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&#39;Opening the door to kill&#39; is a hot topic in traffic accidents. It is very lethal and its liability determination has always been controversial.&quot; Zhou Bo, a senior lawyer who has been representing traffic accident cases for many years, added that at present, all over China The traffic control department in China still lacks unified identification standards when determining responsibility for &quot;opening the door to kill&quot; accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What responsibilities does the online ride-hailing platform bear?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At 18:00 on November 3, 2020, just after work, 39-year-old Zhang He was riding an electric bicycle on the non-motorized lane on his way home. He collided with an online ride-hailing car that had just opened the door, causing Zhang He to be seriously injured and unconscious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incident occurred on Zhongshan 2nd Road, Songjiang District, Shanghai. Relevant judgments show that after completing a trip, the online ride-hailing driver Xia Moulin temporarily stopped the vehicle and did not keep the vehicle close to the right side of the road. He also did not remind passenger Fang Mouxin to observe the traffic coming from behind. Fang Mouxin opened the right door. , resulting in Zhang He’s injury. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My husband now can’t even remember the names of his father, mother and son, nor his own name.” Zhang He’s wife told Southern Weekend reporters that Zhang He was originally the backbone of the family because The car accident resulted in a craniocerebral injury that constituted a tenth-level disability, and the treatment has not healed yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The traffic police detachment of the Songjiang Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau determined that the driver Xia Moulin bore the primary responsibility for the accident, the passenger Fang Mouxin bore the secondary responsibility, and Zhang He was not responsible. The court later ruled that the driver and passenger constituted joint infringement. Among them, the driver&#39;s compensation ratio is 70%, and the compensation is 820,000 yuan; the passenger&#39;s compensation ratio is 30%, and the compensation is 350,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The transportation department will first issue an accident liability determination document to determine the primary and secondary responsibilities of the driver and passengers. Later, the court will make a judgment based on the liability determination document during the trial.&quot; Dai Xianfeng told Southern Weekend reporters , the responsibility determination letter issued by the transportation department will not clarify the responsibilities of the driver and passengers into specific proportions. As for how the final court divides the proportion of primary and secondary responsibilities, it is within the scope of the people&#39;s court to exercise discretion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the judgment of the above-mentioned case shows that Xia Moulin did not actually have insurance related to operating vehicles when using a private car, and his online ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing Company failed to perform its due review duties. ; And as a platform, Didi and Xia Moulin share profits, bear risks, and ensure operational safety, and they are both considered as the carrier of passengers. Therefore, Didi shall bear joint and several liability with the driver Xia Moulin for the losses suffered by the injured in accordance with the law, and jointly compensate 820,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Regardless of whether the online ride-hailing car has the relevant qualifications to operate a vehicle or not, the driver taking the order is regarded as performing his duties. The driver may not be an employee of Didi, but legally, as long as he performs his work tasks , the platform has the responsibility.&quot; Dai Xianfeng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 16 of the &quot;Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Reservation Taxi Operations and Services&quot; stipulates: &quot;Online taxi-hailing platform companies assume the responsibility of the carrier and should ensure operational safety and protect the legitimate rights and interests of passengers.&quot; The Chinese Civil Code also states Relevant regulations require online ride-hailing platforms to assume the responsibilities of the carrier under the transportation contract between the driver and the passenger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that when facing consumers, the carrier’s responsibilities and compensation obligations originally belonging to the driver under the transportation contract may be borne by the online ride-hailing platform to a large extent. The same goes for taxi drivers and taxi companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a passenger pushes the door and causes a &quot;door kill&quot;, but the driver has fulfilled his obligation to remind him, does he still need to bear responsibility? Dai Xianfeng told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;Unless the passenger was intentional, the driver still needs to bear certain liability for the accident. There is a platform or insurance company behind the driver, which has a stronger compensation ability. It is the substantive fairness of the law to allow the victim to receive compensation according to the law. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But not all situations require the owner of a motor vehicle to be held responsible. Zhou Bo added to Southern Weekend reporters that if a vehicle parked on the roadside and opened its door in compliance with regulations, and a non-motor vehicle drove in the wrong direction or caused an &quot;open door kill&quot; casualty accident due to other reasons, the traffic control department may also determine that the non-motor vehicle bears major or even full responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Should insurance recognize the car or the person?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhou Bo told Southern Weekend reporters that in the case of &quot;open door killing&quot; caused by passengers, there are two main controversial links: one One is how the front-end traffic control department determines the primary and secondary responsibilities of the driver and passengers; the other is the insurance company that insures the vehicle. Should it compensate on behalf of the passengers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The most critical link is the identification of front-end responsibilities, under what circumstances passengers should bear responsibility, how to divide primary and secondary responsibilities, and under what circumstances passengers are not required to bear responsibility.” Zhou Bo told Southern Weekend reporters that the traffic control department The methods and standards for determining responsibility are currently not uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in the &quot;open door killing&quot; cases represented by Zhou Bo, the identification standards of traffic police in various places have been different, which also directly affected the final court judgment. For example, when they both open the door for a passenger, some traffic police believe that the passenger and the driver are one and the same tortfeasor; some traffic police believe that the driver should bear full responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a judgment made public in 2020 showed that after a &quot;door-opening killing&quot; accident occurred in Luocheng County, Guangxi, the &quot;Road Traffic Accident Determination&quot; issued by the local traffic police department on the accident involved determined that the passenger If you obstruct the passage of other vehicles when opening and closing the door, you will bear all the responsibility for the traffic accident. The driver is not responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Xianfeng said that under normal circumstances, the court&#39;s judgment will be consistent with the accident liability determination issued by the transportation department, unless there is other direct evidence to the contrary that is sufficient to overturn the liability determination. &quot;On the one hand, from a professional perspective, judges are no better at handling traffic accidents than traffic police; on the other hand, the probative power of evidence issued by state agencies is higher than other general evidence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the driver is responsible If the passenger is fully responsible, there will not be much controversy, because the insurance company will pay in the end. But if the passenger is held responsible, there will be controversy.&quot; Zhou Bo said that when the passenger is found responsible, the main point of dispute will become : Should the insurance company that insures the vehicle bear the liability of the passengers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters checked multiple judicial documents and found that when the driver and the passenger who took the initiative to open the door did not have an operating relationship, but were relatives or friends, many drivers would claim that they were fully responsible. The reason is that drivers, as car owners, have purchased compulsory traffic insurance or commercial third party insurance, and the insurance company can compensate them on their behalf. It is precisely because of this that in such &quot;open door killing&quot; cases, there are endless lawsuits between insurance companies and the infringers of the cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2019, a &quot;door-opening killing&quot; accident occurred in Fengtai District, Beijing. The car driver Zhang Mouyan was friends with the passenger Ma Mou who pushed the door open. After handling by the Fengbei Brigade of Fengtai Traffic Detachment, the car owner and passengers in this case were equally responsible for the accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In court, the car advocate Mouyan argued that he failed to fulfill his obligation to remind and should bear full responsibility. Passenger Ma Moushuang also pointed out that if there is no vehicle, there is no act of getting out of the vehicle. Insurance companies should identify the insured vehicle rather than the person who caused the vehicle accident. The insurance company argued that the company was only responsible for the insured car claimant&#39;s compensation amount, that is, compensation at a rate of 50%, and did not recognize that Zhang Mouyan bore full responsibility. It said: &quot;According to the insurance law, Zhang Mouyan violated the principle of good faith and took the initiative to increase her own responsibilities, which may have resulted in excessive compensation for our company. Our company reserves the right to pursue the two of them for insurance fraud.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the end, the court ruled that the insurance company should be liable for the injured person&#39;s various losses within the scope of insurance based on the joint and several liability of the car owner and passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that in such &quot;open door killing&quot; cases, there were many verdicts in which insurance companies were ultimately responsible for compensation on behalf of passengers. In the aforementioned &quot;open door killing&quot; case in Luocheng County, although the court ruled that the passengers were fully responsible, the final compensation for the injured was paid by the insurance company that insured the vehicle involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Insurance companies generally defend themselves. They believe that insurance compensation is for the insured car owner. Once the driver is not the car owner, no compensation should be paid. However, this defense opinion can only be said to have a certain degree of truth, and the court often does not Adopted.&quot; Zhou Bo said that at present, the exemption clause in this aspect of the insurance contract itself is not clear, and different people will have different understandings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, some online ride-hailing platforms and taxi companies require passengers to open the right door to get in and out of the car as a measure to prevent &quot;open door killing&quot;. Dai Xianfeng believes that it is necessary to strengthen the education and publicity related to &quot;opening the door to kill&quot; for students: &quot;I think that &#39;opening the door to kill&#39; should also be a key part of the training when taking the driver&#39;s license test. We will ask to look at the reflector before starting and after stopping the car. , but there is no direct training for &#39;opening the door to kill&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(Zhou Bo and Zhang He are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[改革开放45周年—建言者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260156]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;45 years ago, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping’s requirement to “turn banks into real banks”, China began a planned and Step-by-step financial system reform. Finance, the core of the modern economy, has been given an extraordinary mission in China&#39;s reform process. 45 years ago, the People&#39;s Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance separated, and China&#39;s &quot;unified&quot; financial system reform began. Although it was once trapped in the reform detour of the &quot;Five Major Contracts&quot;, it entered a &quot;big step&quot; process since 1993. 45 years later, &quot;deepening the reform of the financial system&quot; has become the action plan, and the reform and opening up of the financial market has also entered the deep water zone. Taking history as a mirror can help us understand gains and losses. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews with the promoters, experiencers and witnesses of China&#39;s financial reform and opening up to provide suggestions for the stable and long-term development of China&#39;s financial industry.</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 23:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中华白海豚“迷路”，广州正在追踪施救]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260218]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[清华国家金融研究院张伟：房贷证券化是双刃剑，目前更不宜推出丨首席访谈⑬]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260180]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The much-watched Central Financial Work Conference proposed “&lt;span>;Aiming to accelerate the construction of a financial power&lt;/span >;&lt;span>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;This is the first time that the central government has proposed the goal of “financial power”. Among my country&#39;s major financial fields, the banking industry is the largest and is the main transmission system for macroeconomic control policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the banking industry is facing multiple challenges: under the counter-cyclical trend, the net interest margin of the banking industry has dropped to a historical low; at the same time, as the real estate industry enters a new stage, banks regard it as high-quality assets. The mortgage business is facing difficulties; after testing the waters of equity investment, the investment research capabilities of bank wealth management subsidiaries have also been questioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China’s A-share “profit king”—can the banking industry achieve breakthroughs by leveraging financial technology? Has it reached a critical point in transformation? How do banks shape their core competitiveness? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A researcher from Southern Weekend’s New Finance Research Center interviewed Zhang Wei, deputy director of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University. Zhang Wei focuses on researching monetary policy and financial crisis early warning mechanisms. He also took the lead in compiling the &quot;2023 China Banking Industry Ranking Top 200 Research Report&quot; and taught more than 300 training courses for the five major state-owned banks and some joint-stock banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/zslPwg6O7gV7qMYCXPkV9k3e0LDmM0nIxuTB425I.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;307&quot; height= &quot;410&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/zslPwg6O7gV7qMYCXPkV9k3e0LDmM0nIxuTB425I.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257375&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhang Wei, deputy director of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mortgage securitization&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;High risk&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Our research found that housing mortgage loans in my country basically have floating interest rates. Most foreign bank mortgage loans have fixed interest rates. Why is it different? What is its background? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Most foreign mortgage interest rates are fixed interest rates, while our country’s mortgage loans have quasi-floating interest rates, that is, they are not completely floating. There is an essential difference between the two. In the past, after the central bank adjusted interest rates, existing mortgage interest rates were not adjusted immediately, and were often adjusted accordingly the following year. In other words, the central bank can adjust the interest rate multiple times within a year, but the borrower&#39;s mortgage interest rate remains basically unchanged within a year and can only start to adjust on January 1 of the following year. Therefore, it is not a fully floating interest rate but a quasi-floating interest rate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the development of the banking system, the primary purpose of various policies was to make banks grow and grow, and to reduce bank capital operation risks. The choice of a floating rate form stems from banking tradition. Fixed-rate mortgages are lower risk for the borrower but higher risk for the bank. In the past two years, some reforms have been made to mortgage interest rates. Borrowers can choose fixed interest rates or floating interest rates. However, existing housing loans still account for the majority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;We also found through research that the balance of domestic housing mortgage loans is huge, but Mortgage asset securitization (MBS) has developed slowly since its inception in 2006. In the first half of 2023, there will be zero issuance of RMBS. This is also very different from the mortgage business in developed countries. Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are four reasons for the slow progress of domestic mortgage asset securitization. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, mortgage asset securitization is an imported product. Mortgage securitization tools such as MBS in the United States have been developed since the 1970s. China&#39;s housing loan market developed relatively late. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, domestic mortgage asset securitization started in 2006, just as the U.S. real estate bubble began to burst. The following year, the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis triggered a chain reaction of MBS defaults and credit derivatives such as CDO and CDS, which eventually led to the 2008 global financial crisis. The external crisis requires us to re-understand the pros and cons of mortgage securitization. For regulatory agencies, a more cautious approach has been chosen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, mortgage asset securitization is a financial derivative. China has always been cautious about the development of financial derivatives because derivatives are highly leveraged and risky. Domestic laws on futures and derivatives were promulgated many years after the subprime mortgage crisis broke out, and did not include credit derivatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, over the past 20 years, my country’s commercial housing market has experienced a process of development and regulation of relaxation-tightening-relaxation-retightening-relaxation again. Maintain strict control over the financing of the real estate market through asset management products such as credit and trust to prevent the real estate market from overheating. Mortgage asset securitization is an important means of real estate financing and will also be strictly controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think it is possible to accelerate the implementation of asset securitization to activate the market? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Activating the real estate market through MBS is an option. my country&#39;s real estate credit market is an issue and hold model. If mortgage assets are securitized, banks can package the mortgages and sell them through securitization, and brokers can then distribute them to institutional investors including funds. The final investor may be an individual or a business. Mortgage risk is thus dispersed. Banks also receive more liquidity as a result. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But mortgage asset securitization is a double-edged sword. Because it has high leverage, if there is any disturbance or unfavorable situation, the impact it will have will be huge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, mortgage securitization is indeed a direction. However, I believe that the risks are relatively high, the supporting systems and regulatory measures are still weak, and it should not develop too fast. Especially in the current situation where risk prevention is the keynote, it is even more unsuitable to launch. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Need to shift to intensive&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;development&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;model&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Under the counter-cyclical situation, the profits of the banking industry generally increased slightly and even the profits of individual banks dropped sharply, and the provision coverage ratio and capital adequacy ratio both declined. The 2023 interim reports of various banks revealed this group signal. However, under the current capital market conditions, refinancing on the stock market is difficult to achieve. How do you think banks can replenish core capital at this stage? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Commercial banks can replenish their first-tier core capital by issuing common shares, increasing capital from existing shareholders, or issuing additional shares. In addition, endogenous funds are also important channels. Such as retained profits, other comprehensive income and risk reserves, etc. This is to make &quot;blood&quot; by oneself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Listed banks are the &quot;outstanding elements&quot; among banks. There are more than 4,000 small and medium-sized banks that cannot replenish capital through the stock market and can only increase capital through targeted capital increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banks mainly issue subordinated bonds, preferred stocks and perpetual bonds to supplement secondary capital. However, the threshold for issuance of perpetual bonds and subordinated bonds is relatively high, and not all thousands of small and medium-sized banks are eligible. In addition, the issuance of special bonds by local governments is also an important means to supplement the capital of small and medium-sized banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You just mentioned that endogenous funds are also very important. How do most banks get rid of the predicament of becoming increasingly dependent on external financing as they develop? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the past few decades, the scale of the banking industry has expanded rapidly and interest rates have been earned. In recent years, both the return on assets and the return on capital have been declining, and companies can only &quot;win&quot; by relying on scale. Large scale, low efficiency, and rapid capital consumption. If you cannot support the rapid expansion of asset scale by relying on your own &quot;blood production&quot;, you must rely on more external financing to replenish capital. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To completely get rid of this predicament, banks need to conduct refined operations on existing assets and earn more profits with the same asset scale, rather than simply increasing absolute profits by increasing scale. Extensive way. The core is to shift from the current extensive development model that emphasizes scale to an intensive development model that emphasizes efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, interest rate spreads have fallen to historic lows, and the financial sustainability of bank operations is in doubt. When the current scale remains unchanged or even continues to decline, banks must find ways to be more refined and detailed, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, especially to reduce management fees and other costs. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of fund utilization. For example, adjust the direction of loan investment, make more efforts in the financial market, and do more financial market business. In addition, efforts need to be made to improve risk control levels and reduce bad debt costs and risk losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Core competitiveness cannot be shaped through outsourcing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now digital finance has become the transformation path for banks, and it is also the only way to achieve inclusive finance. You also had similar views in the &quot;2023 China Banking Industry Ranking Top 200 Research Report&quot; published by &quot;Tsinghua Financial Review&quot;. You also believe that when financial institutions build underlying business logic in accordance with the genetic requirements of the Internet, they need to break the internal data barriers of the institution and make comprehensive adjustments to the working mechanism. In this process, banks are bound to be exposed to many risks. What do you think is the underlying business logic of banks’ Internet? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The core of bank digital transformation lies in data connectivity. At the same time, the organizational structure and top-level design must be reconstructed according to Internet thinking. There will be many challenges and risks involved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, there are many obstacles in data connection. A bank is a behemoth that involves many businesses, institutions, personnel, and outlets, and the phenomenon of data islands is serious. The problem is particularly serious for large banks, where it is difficult to integrate data between head offices and branches, between various departments of the head office, and even between departments within the same department. In addition to breaking through internal data barriers and breaking down information islands, it is also necessary to achieve safe and standardized connections with external data such as government data, corporate data, alternative Internet data, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always held the view that the banks of the future will be technology companies with banking licenses. It requires data, scenarios, and technology, that is, &quot;no data, no finance&quot;, &quot;no scenario, no finance&quot;, &quot;no technology, no finance&quot;. This is a trinity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, in order to open up external data, banks need to build some scenarios themselves and have the ability to continuously generate new data. Therefore, establishing the scene is particularly important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banks need to pay attention to this matter from the top-level design and reconstruct the business logic structure and organizational structure that are different from traditional banks in the past. The difficulty is that traditional genes may eat away at Internet genes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the traditional business of banks is still strong - the Internet business is still &quot;Sesame&quot;, and the traditional business is still &quot;Watermelon&quot;. However, in the future, the Internet business will grow into a &quot;watermelon&quot; and the traditional business will gradually shrink into a &quot;sesame&quot;. Due to operating pressure, traditional businesses still have to pay attention. &quot;Sesame&quot; cannot become &quot;watermelon&quot; overnight. It requires a process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform must not only prevent some new businesses from being cannibalized by traditional businesses, but also prevent traditional businesses from simply being moved online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Judging from the recruitment situation this autumn, most bank IT R&amp;D positions Hiring is down. This may be related to the rise of large model technology. Some banks’ fintech strategies are shifting from building their own intelligent customer service systems to cooperating with external technology platforms. What do you think of this phenomenon? Will outsourcing financial technology business bring greater risks to banks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Outsourcing has advantages and risks, and different organizations should have different choices. Large and medium-sized banks should maintain their core technologies and avoid relying on outsourcing institutions; while small and medium-sized banks can consider outsourcing part of their business or cooperate with other platform companies. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on external institutions can quickly solve the bank&#39;s current problems. In the long run, over-reliance on outsourcing institutions and platforms and loss of opportunities to develop internal skills is the biggest risk, followed by the risk of data security. The reason is that relying on outsourcing makes it difficult for banks to establish solid core technical capabilities over time. This is particularly important for large banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the long run, banks, especially large banks, will still have to build their own systems. Core competitiveness cannot be shaped through outsourcing. It is a long-term solution for large banks to improve their internal capabilities. For some small banks, they can choose to outsource most of their businesses to build their core competitiveness in other aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Test the equity market&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Establish a high-level &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;investment research team&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Yes Important matters&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The bank’s financial management subsidiary is testing the waters of equity financial management The product is 3 years old, but generally performs poorly. As of October 16, 2023, among all 34 bank equity products, 29 have broken the net. What do you think of this phenomenon? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After the new regulations on asset management, the development model of bank financial management has undergone fundamental changes. The development of equity financial management products is one direction. . Compared with public funds, wealth management subsidiaries or the asset management departments of many banks are too young. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem of equity products of bank wealth management subsidiaries being depleted is, on the one hand, the downward environment of the entire market, which is also the main reason. On the other hand, it is caused by the lack of management capabilities of the financial management subsidiaries themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a novice, the wealth management subsidiary is inferior to the market in equity investments, but it is still tolerable at the moment. But in five to ten years, if there is no improvement, the road for equity bank financial products will only become narrower and narrower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Should financial management subsidiaries cooperate with fellow fund companies and share the latter investment research results? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the long run, building a strong investment research team is a top priority for financial management subsidiaries. It is difficult for wealth management subsidiaries to cooperate with fund companies under the parent bank because competition between the two outweighs cooperation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the incentive mechanism and salary levels of financial management subsidiaries are a major shortcoming. Subject to salary distribution constraints, the salary levels of wealth management subsidiaries of major state-owned banks are significantly lower than those of public funds. This is a great constraint on building a high-level investment research team. A breakthrough is needed in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[串标围标在工程建设等领域多发；招标方设租寻租不容忽视丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260146]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate released a number of typical cases on the official website of punishing the crime of collusive bidding in accordance with the law. The relevant person in charge of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate said that in recent years, problems in the bidding process have become prominent. In many fields such as engineering construction and equipment procurement, illegal and criminal cases such as collusion in bidding, bribery, and bribery have occurred frequently, causing hidden dangers to project quality and safety management and seriously disrupting Market Order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tendering is a procurement method used in some large-scale projects. In theory, tendering is a means to promote competition, especially public tendering. From the perspective of a tenderer, let your procurement needs reach more potential suppliers and promote competition among them as much as possible so that you can buy the best goods, services, etc. with the least money. For bidders, through public bidding channels, they can learn more about business opportunities, participate in competition, and win business through strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, national regulations stipulate that some specific projects must identify suppliers through public bidding. For example, the Government Procurement Law stipulates that government procurement projects of goods and services above a certain amount (the specific amount is uniformly stipulated by the provincial level, and many provinces set it as more than 2 million yuan) must be publicly tendered. Relevant construction law rules stipulate that if the estimated price of a single construction contract for housing construction and municipal infrastructure projects is more than 2 million yuan, or the total project investment is more than 30 million yuan, bidding must be conducted, all of which use state-owned funds or state-owned funds. Those holding a controlling or dominant position must invite public bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if multiple bidders or even tenderers collude with each other and collude in bidding, the bidding will become a cover to hide the public and fail to achieve the purpose of bidding. For example, in a typical case released by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate this time, there was an information technology project of a certain unit that was openly tendered to the public. Two companies colluded in the bidding. As a result, the winning bid price of the project was more than 35 million yuan, which was far higher than the actual cost. Such a result has caused serious losses to the bidding unit. In addition, collusive bidding by multiple suppliers will also affect market competition. Some bidders even bribe bid evaluation committee members to give their bids high marks in order to win the bid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some cases of bid-rigging, the tenderer may not know about it, but the bidders collude with each other to raise the price and obtain more benefits. However, there are also many cases of bid-rigging. The staff of the bidding unit are not only informed, but they may even actively collude with the bidders to raise the price, or give the project to a designated bidder to benefit themselves. As for other companies participating in the bidding, they only &quot;accompany the bidding&quot; to meet the requirement of multiple suppliers participating in the bidding. In fact, the contents of their bid documents are worse than those of the designated bidders, and it is impossible to win the bid. They appear just to cooperate in acting and get a little &quot;accompanying the bid fee.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is undoubtedly rent-seeking, bribery and bribery. If the bidding unit is a state-owned enterprise or even a government agency or public institution, it will be suspected of bribery by public officials. Even if the bidding unit is a private enterprise, collusion in bidding will also constitute crimes such as job embezzlement and bribery of non-state personnel. The bidder paid bribes. The corruption behind this rent-seeking is quite astonishing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Zhejiang Daily&quot; once reported that Zhu Zhixiang, the former chairman of Shaoxing Urban Investment Group, as the main person in charge of the bidding unit, colluded with others and the bidders during the bidding process of relevant projects. , the total winning bid amount of the bidders reached more than 4.42 billion yuan. In April 2023, Zhu Zhixiang was sentenced to eleven years and six months in the first instance for bribery and bid collusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in some fields, bid-rigging and collusion have formed a complete industrial chain. Some practitioners do not have relevant qualifications themselves, so they &quot;affiliate&quot; with qualified units. The affiliated units charge a &quot;management fee&quot; that is a certain percentage of the winning bid amount and share the profits from the winning bid. There are also professional scalpers and engineering brokers who specialize in bid-rigging. They have great powers, and some may be related to the tendering party, and some can even obtain the contact information of bid evaluation experts in time and bribe them. There are also &quot;hackers&quot; who can invade the bid evaluation expert database and provide them with expert lists and contact information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang police once uncovered a company with only nine employees and no construction team, but it repeatedly won bids for large engineering projects. In just two years, it participated in a total of 338 bids for engineering projects. The investigation found that this is a professional bid-rigging gang. After winning the bid, they illegally sell the project and profit from it. These engineering projects are stripped down and subcontracted at many levels. Not only will the project cost increase, but the quality of the project will also be difficult to guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, according to the latest criminal prosecution standards formulated by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security in 2022, collusion in bidding, the winning amount of the bid is more than 4 million yuan, the illegal income is more than 200,000 yuan, or threats, deception, bribery By using other means, colluding in bidding multiple times, etc., they are all suspected of committing the crime of colluding in bidding, and a case should be filed and prosecuted. In particular, we must severely crack down on rent-seeking and corruption involving insiders of the tendering party to maintain a fair market order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[允许博士生分流转为硕士，你支持吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260095]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[平均降价58%！南周记者直击第九批国家药品集采现场]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260170]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[俄乌情报体系对抗：“外卖小哥”下毒引发的暗战 | 智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260154]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 24, 2023, Russian media reported that recently, A &quot;delivery boy&quot; attempted to &quot;poison&quot; dozens of Russian military officials and pilots at a celebration event for the alumni of Russia&#39;s Armavir Higher Military Aviation School, but the attempt failed after the Russian intelligence agency discovered it in time. It is reported that the &quot;takeaway boy&quot; is Yegor Semyonov, a 32-year-old man from Melitopol, Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Russian Armavir City Court arrested Yegor Semyonov for &quot;disturbing the peace&quot; and detained him for 15 days. He may face more serious &quot;terrorism&quot; next accusation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Victor Fisen, chairman of the Veterans Committee of Russia&#39;s Armavir Higher Military Aviation School, said that this was a large-scale poisoning attempt against the school&#39;s graduates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident also aroused public attention on the &quot;secret war&quot; between Russian and Ukrainian intelligence agents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Poisonous Big Cake&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 21, 77 alumni of the Armavir Higher Military Aviation School in Krasnodar Krai, Russia, from the class of 2003, returned to school to attend Graduation 20 The anniversary celebrations included a number of active Russian Air Force pilots and senior officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the restaurant party, a &quot;takeaway boy&quot; suddenly delivered a 20-kilogram cake and several boxes of whiskey, claiming to be a gift from an alumnus who could not attend the party. The huge two The layer cake immediately caught everyone&#39;s attention. Everyone immediately started taking photos and posting in the chat group to express their gratitude. At the same time, everyone was asking each other who was the person who sent this gift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since no one &quot;claimed&quot; the gift, partygoers became suspicious of the origins of the cake and whiskey. A Russian military officer who attended the event prevented the pilots present from drinking and eating cakes and immediately reported it to the Russian Federal Security Service. Subsequently, the Russian Federal Security Service tested the cake and whiskey and found that they contained highly toxic substances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, a school security officer captured the figure of the &quot;delivery boy&quot; from the surveillance video. Agents of the Russian security service identified the &quot;takeaway boy&quot; as 32-year-old Yegor Semyonov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian police quickly identified Semyonov and arrested him. After graduating from high school, Semyonov became a weightlifting coach, often participating in various weightlifting competitions, and later worked as a security guard. Since 2015, Semyonov has lived in the suburbs of Moscow, the Russian capital, and has been engaged in the installation of video surveillance systems and walkie-talkies. In recent years, he has developed a keen interest in firearms and sports shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After delivering the poisonous cake, Semenov planned to fly back to Moscow, but was intercepted and taken away by Russian security personnel at the airport. Semyonov confessed to his actions and told prosecutors how he learned about the celebrations. He even painted the military academy&#39;s logo onto the cake for a greater realistic effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Russian side believes that Semyonov may be a spy sent by Kiev to Moscow. This &quot;toxic plot&quot; to murder the Russian pilot was probably carried out under the instruction of Kiev. This is Ukrainian defense intelligence An assassination planned by the General Administration. If Russia relaxes its vigilance and becomes paralyzed this time, it will pay a heavy price for this incident. Currently, Russian security services are &quot;looking for the person who made the cake and others involved in this sabotage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Russian-Ukrainian Unrestricted War&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The national security department or the military intelligence department serves the needs of national security military struggle. To a certain extent, it can kill the opponent or be defeated by the opponent. If put to death, one of the two must be one. The competition between the Russian and Ukrainian intelligence services can be described as each other’s shadow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when the war between Russia and Ukraine is raging, the &quot;poisoning of a delivery boy&quot; incident in Ukraine shows that both Russia and Ukraine have the characteristics of &quot;unrestricted warfare&quot; in terms of means, strategies, and moral integrity. This kind of Although the lethality of &quot;underhanded tactics&quot; cannot change the outcome of a conflict, it will have certain negative effects on changing the local situation on the battlefield, damaging the opponent&#39;s morale, and selecting combat methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Ukraine’s intelligence system structure and confrontation capabilities have been greatly improved. The U.S. intelligence agency is huge, and with the human and technical intelligence support provided by the U.S. intelligence agencies to Ukraine, Ukraine and Russia are launching an intelligence &quot;secret war&quot; on the &quot;hidden&quot; front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ukrainian Military Intelligence Agency has been involved in many assassinations in Russia. In 2022, the National Security Service of Ukraine planned and executed the car bombing that killed Dukina. A Ukrainian security official said: &quot;Dukina is the daughter of a Russian propagandist. The car bombings and other actions on Russian soil were meant to show Ukraine&#39;s enemies that even for those &#39;disrespecting Ukraine, punishment is at hand&#39; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former official of the Fifth Directorate of the Ukrainian National Security Agency said that these actions can only leave a &quot;deep impression&quot; on Zelensky, but cannot help the Ukrainian army move towards victory. “Kill one and another will soon take his place.” The assassination campaign in Ukraine was clearly driven more by impulse than logic, and not only lacked a strategic objective but may have exposed Ukrainian intelligence agents. This kind of &quot;assassination squad&quot; may be free from the hands of the president or the military and become a source of &quot;terrorism&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Western countries’ intelligence support for Ukraine has even more impact than arms assistance. Ukraine’s new intelligence capabilities proved their worth at the outset of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The Ukrainian Security Service obtained intelligence about high-value Russian targets and carried out strikes, killing several commanders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The top priority target of the Ukrainian National Security Agency is the bridge connecting the Russian mainland and the island of Crimea. In 2022, the Ukrainian Security Bureau attacked the bridge twice. The Ukrainian Security Bureau placed powerful explosives in a truck and later used drones to launch a second sabotage attack on the bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ukrainian military intelligence also used its own drone fleet to launch dozens of attacks in Russia, including penetrating Russian air defense systems and attacking buildings in Moscow. In May 2023, an operation affected part of the roof of the Kremlin. The attacks were carried out by both long-range drones launched from Ukraine and by agents and guerrillas working in Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the series of assassinations and sneak attacks carried out by the U.S.-backed Ukrainian intelligence agencies, the Russian government has repeatedly accused Ukraine of adopting a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; strategy and has also taken a series of powerful counterattacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 9, 2023, ITASS reported that the Russian Federal Security Service arrested a Russian citizen recruited by Ukrainian intelligence services and accused him of trying to blow up a bomb in Crimea in June. A natural gas pipeline. On August 13, the Russian Ministry of Defense released a video of a Russian drone destroying the &quot;Starlink&quot; satellite system communication terminal used by the Ukrainian army. The Russian drone operator discovered the &quot;Starlink&quot; satellite system communication terminal supported by the US military and disguised by the Ukrainian army. The drone accurately struck and destroyed the communication terminal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zakharova said on a TV program on October 24: &quot;Whether it is in Russia or in its surrounding areas, a large number of terrorist attacks will not start in 2022, but will start later. Start early. It is no secret to anyone that the security services affiliated with the Kiev regime are responsible for these large numbers of terrorist attacks.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;An opponent is an opponent&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Historically, Russia and Ukraine The intelligence system was born out of the KGB during the Soviet period. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Russian and Ukrainian intelligence agencies adopted an administrative system with decentralized powers and separate administrations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1995, Russia established the new Federal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service. , the Federal Security Service of counterintelligence. The Russian General Staff established the &quot;GRU&quot; responsible for military intelligence, which is the General Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. Its director is concurrently served by a Russian Deputy Chief of General Staff. The main goal is Collect military intelligence from strategic to tactical levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ukraine established the National Security Agency in March 1992, maintaining a special system directly led by the President of Ukraine, and inherited almost all functions of the KGB during the Soviet period. 1993 In July 2020, Ukraine established a Military Intelligence Bureau in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, similar to Russia’s Intelligence Bureau of the General Staff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current construction of Ukraine’s intelligence system has also received full support from the United States.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To control the risk of &quot;serious penetration by Russia&#39;s FSB,&quot; the CIA spent tens of millions of dollars to transform Ukraine&#39;s Soviet-style spy agency into a powerful ally against Moscow. The CIA and Ukraine&#39;s National Security Service Cooperate to establish a new department against Russia, the &quot;Fifth Directorate&quot;, intended to implement &quot;urgent measures&quot; against Russia.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Security Service of Ukraine has also added a Sixth Directorate to cooperate with the British MI6. Training base Based outside Kiev, CIA personnel mentor hand-picked trainees, requiring agents to &quot;be able to operate behind the lines and work as covert teams.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In helping the Ukrainian Security Service establish the &quot;Secret Service&quot; At the same time as the &quot;Fifth Directorate&quot;, the CIA also invested &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; to transform Ukraine&#39;s military intelligence agency. A former US intelligence official who has worked in Ukraine said: &quot;We have calculated that the Military Intelligence Agency is a smaller, A more agile organization where we can have a greater impact. MI is our little baby. We provide them with new equipment and training. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At bases in Ukraine and later the United States, Ukrainian MI agents were trained in a variety of skills ranging from covert exercises behind enemy lines to weapons platforms and explosives. The CIA provided state-of-the-art surveillance and electronic eavesdropping systems, including mobile devices that could be placed along Russian-controlled routes in eastern Ukraine and software used to eavesdrop on the cell phones of Russian officials visiting the occupied territories from Moscow, with all information collected being shared with the United States.&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;A former senior military intelligence officer said: &quot;In one day, we can intercept 250,000 to 300,000 individual communications from the Russian army and the Federal Security Service, and the amount of information is so large that we cannot manage it ourselves. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thousands of data were transmitted back to Washington through the CIA’s newly constructed facilities, where they were scrutinized by CIA and NSA analysts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Military Intelligence also A network of informants was established within the Russian security apparatus. As a measure of mutual trust between the United States and Ukraine, the CIA was allowed direct contact with agents recruited and managed by Ukrainian intelligence services.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian-Ukrainian Intelligence Special Operations , due to different countries, different social systems, different war backgrounds and natures, the tactics and methods are also very different, and the effects are very different.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incident of Ukrainian takeaways delivering poisonous cakes to Russian pilots shows that Ukrainian agents It has been trying to launch raids on Russia through various channels in an attempt to weaken its military power and national security. The Russian intelligence agencies have taken timely and powerful countermeasures. This shows that both Russia and Ukraine have strong intelligence systems to support them to varying degrees. .&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[收容两百万阿富汗难民的巴基斯坦为何“变脸”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260164]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the early morning, gunfire rang out again in Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 4, 2023, the Pakistani military stated that it killed 9 militants that day.

Instead, conflicts and frictions continued, especially There have been many exchanges of fire in border areas. Pakistan has also become the target of terrorist attacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2023, in addition to frequent attacks by traditional terrorist forces in Pakistan, the Khorasan branch of the &quot;Islamic State&quot; has also begun to attack Afghanistan. Transfer within Pakistan. This has caused tremendous security and domestic pressure on Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It is difficult for Pakistan to control border security issues, and the cost is extremely high in reality.&quot; Zhang Jiadong said that a large number of weapons are now flowing from Afghanistan to Pakistan, which has become a problem for many Equipment of anti-Pakistani militants. &quot;Afghanistan is not particularly active in helping Pakistan, which makes Pakistan quite annoyed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Pakistani government also accused Afghanistan of providing provision for militant groups that carried out these attacks. provided a &quot;safe haven&quot;, causing tensions in Pakistan-Afghanistan relations. It said that of the 24 suicide bombings in Pakistan in 2023, 14 were carried out by Afghans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But what is noteworthy is that as early as the 1990s, when the Taliban first seized power in Afghanistan, some Taliban members came from Pakistan. Many media reports stated that Pakistani military officers even directly participated in the Taliban&#39;s operations at that time and received support from the Pakistan Intelligence Agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan is an important regional player in the power game in Afghanistan.&quot; Ma Jianfu said. However, the rise of the Taliban has stimulated the development of religious extremism and ethnic separatism in South Asia, causing refugee and drug problems to further spill over into South Asia, resulting in severe challenges to the regional security situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Other armed organizations saw that they could successfully seize power, and they also tried to imitate and follow suit. This is a major incentive for terrorist forces in Pakistan to become active again.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu Analysis shows that the security situation in Pakistan had improved in the past few years, but has worsened significantly recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is undeniable that Baa has a unique relationship. For example, the two countries share a border of about 2,570 kilometers and are also important trading partners. There are also many close ties with each other such as culture, race and religion. The outside world believes that Pakistan and Afghanistan are &quot;love-hate&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for many years. This is not an easy task.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu said that not every country can do this Not to mention that Pakistan is not a rich country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ma Jianfu believes that Pakistan has tried to expel or repatriate Afghan refugees many times over the past decades, but with poor results. The regular flow of Afghan refugees to and from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area has become the norm. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Deportation order&quot; is also a &quot;pressure order&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Today we say goodbye to the people of Afghanistan as they begin their journey home .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Earlier, Pakistan’s interior minister publicly tweeted on social media and attached a video of Afghans boarding a bus, adding &quot;This action proves that Pakistan is determined to deport any individual living in the country without proper documentation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&quot;If they don&#39;t send us Send it back and we will live here for the rest of our lives.&quot; 35-year-old Afghan Mohammad Rahim&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; was born in Pakistan. He married a Pakistani woman,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; span>;&lt;span>;Together&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Raising Pakistani-born children without Pakistani identity documents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mohmand, who has lived in Pakistan for more than ten years, has three children and a big family. Mohmand has no family in Afghanistan. She didn&#39;t know where to go next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For decades, millions of Afghan refugees have lived in Pakistan for a long time, bringing huge financial burdens and various risks to Pakistan. A large number of illegal refugees The detention of Afghan refugees not only brings certain security risks, but also has a certain impact on the employment of Pakistanis.&quot; Ma Jianfu analyzed that Pakistan&#39;s expulsion of Afghan refugees is also due to economic pressure. Undocumented immigrants and refugees are widely believed to have drained the country&#39;s resources for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For Pakistan&#39;s &quot;deportation order&quot; operation, the United Nations Refugee Agency and the International Organization for Migration condemned Pakistan&#39;s plan to bring &quot; Serious protection risk”. Restrictions on female NGO staff in Afghanistan have resulted in fewer employment opportunities for women in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Data from the United Nations Refugee Agency shows that among Afghans who have recently returned home, 78% said that fear of being arrested in Pakistan was the reason for their departure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s expulsion of Afghan refugees this time will further worsen the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan and put tremendous pressure on Afghanistan.&quot; Ma Jianfu told Southern Weekend reporters, Due to complex reasons, it will be difficult for Pakistan&#39;s expulsion work to proceed normally, and it may also trigger armed resistance and worsen the anti-terrorism and security situation in both countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that this is not the first time that the Pakistani government has expelled Afghan refugees. Pakistan only uses the refugees as a tool to put pressure on Afghanistan. Pakistan&#39;s expulsion will not go too far, because some terrorist forces and extremist forces are trying to take advantage of this opportunity, so Pakistan&#39;s move is likely to be &quot;loud and rainy&quot; and achieve the desired effect through large-scale propaganda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s pressure strategy has been tried and tested time and time again.&quot; He said. As long as the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan is tense, Pakistan will expel the refugees &quot;until Afghanistan cannot bear it anymore and will give in to Pakistan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 2, local time, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation of the interim government of Afghanistan stated that the Taliban government is currently providing assistance from multiple locations to families returning to Afghanistan from Pakistan. , and placed them in temporary camps. At the same time, some families with residential houses left the camps and went to the provinces where they lived, but there were also some families who did not have shelter and faced challenges in their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Taliban government also stated that it will try its best to find jobs for the returnees. However, according to World Bank data, Afghanistan&#39;s unemployment rate more than doubled from the time the Taliban took over to June 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that international sanctions on Afghanistan’s banking industry and the reduction of international aid to Afghanistan after the Taliban took over would lead to return Immigrants and refugees put enormous pressure on already limited resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当引进的高学历人才决定离开县城]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260140]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the morning of February 13, 2019, a city&#39;s talent service &quot;one-stop&quot; platform The window was opened, and applications for housing security for the first batch of imported talents in the city began to be accepted.

The city’s first batch of imported talents applied for housing security. (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, when tens of millions of college graduates are flocking to job fairs, 27-year-old Lu Min I was worried about how to resign from the bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A year ago, she returned to her hometown of Henan through talent introduction and was admitted to the Human Resources and Social Security Bureau of a county in northern Henan. The reason for her choice is also very simple. Five years ago, she graduated from a 985 university in Shanghai with a bachelor&#39;s degree in human resources management. She changed many jobs but could not satisfy her parents. &quot;They felt that I must have an establishment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is no need to repeat the enthusiasm of parents and students for public examinations and compilation examinations. In the past, it was a stereotype unique to certain provinces, but now it has become The other side that everyone dreams of reaching. But there is obviously more than one road leading to Rome. In addition to the conventional paths such as national examinations, public examinations, and selection and transfer, the relatively low-key talent introduction policy that has been in place for many years has attracted more and more attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Talent introduction, as the name suggests, is a recruitment method used by local institutions, usually in counties or urban areas, to recruit graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees from well-known universities to work within the system. . Different from the administrative establishment provided by selection and recruitment of civil servants, talent introduction can only provide career establishment. Places that adopt the talent introduction method will omit the written examination link and promise candidates a certain talent subsidy, settling-in allowance, etc., which is intended to reflect the needs of the local area. The wise are like thirsty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the opening of autumn recruitment in 2023, a new round of talent introduction has also begun. On various recruitment consultation websites, there are many announcements about remote counties offering high salary subsidies and hiring masters or even PhDs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But at the same time, some young people who were attracted found that the balance between ideal life and reality was far more difficult than imagined. The problem is not new. If the county can still provide the &quot;one-stop-seen&quot; life that our parents did, it may not be able to match the talents they are vying to introduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In an article published in 2022, Fang Changchun, a professor at the School of Social Sciences at Nanjing University and director of the Employment Quality Research Center, once pointed out that various regions are actively recruiting highly educated talents. While being open-minded, we should also accurately select and use materials based on the actual economic and social development of the county, and treat the use of talents with caution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I was a little anxious to go ashore at that time”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Back to a Thursday in May 2022, Lu Min was attending tutoring She was in class and preparing for a teacher preparation exam when she got a call asking if she could participate in the county talent recruitment interview on Saturday. She signed up three months ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are only two days left before the interview. The day before the exam, Lu Min dug out the high school uniform from the bottom of the box - a black suit jacket, paired with a light blue shirt and dark suit pants, to make up a complete formal suit. In the evening, I made a phone call with a friend who was familiar with public examinations to improve my interview skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a one-person interview. The examination room was a classroom in a local middle school. In the middle, there was a table prepared for interviewers, covered with a piece of white paper. Opposite, five examiners sat side by side, with timers placed beside the table. 10 minutes, the countdown has not started yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was hard to contain the tension, but fortunately, the temporary assault content came in handy. Similar to the exam preparation guide, among the three interview questions Lu Min encountered, the first question was pragmatic and asked about work attitude; the last two questions were pragmatic and asked what to do if agricultural products are unsaleable and how to properly place trash cans in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lu Min later reviewed his performance on that day and consciously answered well, &quot;I took the impact of the epidemic into consideration for the last two questions,&quot; but for the first question &quot;I should quote more materials, but I was nervous and forgot about it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is not the first time Lu Min has sought to enter the system. After graduating from college in 2018, in order to meet her parents&#39; expectations, she took the civil service exam in her hometown city once, but stopped taking the written exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the spring of 2021, Lu Min joined a private vocational and technical college as a teacher. This job has no establishment, but the teaching pressure is low and there are many vacations, which once made her very satisfied. However, her parents gave her an ultimatum and she must take the entrance examination in 2022. To this end, starting from February 2022, Lu Min &quot;cast his net everywhere.&quot; Most of the positions applied for were for teachers, but the only one who heard back was the one for talent introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​week after the interview, Lu Min received the notification that he had successfully landed. She was happy at first, &quot;I can finally shut my parents&#39; mouths.&quot; But worries soon struck that this was not a job she really wanted after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A year has passed, and Lu Min is always wandering around the personnel files. Compared with many other government agencies, this job is considered gentle. Except for the employment season, she only needs to send and receive three or four files a day. However, she was never sure whether this was her ideal life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unlike Lu Min, Meng Qiping was already 35 years old before he successfully landed through talent introduction, and his life was full of frustrations and dissatisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Meng Qiping graduated from a general state university in the United States with a science major. After returning to China for employment, he worked as a programmer and an IELTS training teacher. In 2020, before the &quot;double reduction&quot; was implemented, he went to the UK to study for graduate school. After graduating in 2022, he applied for a doctorate from a school in Malaysia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although at that time, going to Southeast Asia to study for a Ph.D. had become synonymous with &quot;mixed&quot; academic qualifications, the pressure of studying for a Ph.D. was still beyond his expectation, and &quot;the frustration was relatively strong.&quot; . In October 2022, Meng Qiping dropped out of school and returned to China again. This time, he set his sights on the hottest thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a native of Kunming, recruiting talents from this province was his first choice. However, after several interviews, Meng Qiping found that because the salary offered by Yunnan was very attractive, The competition is too fierce, and it is normal for &quot;about ten people to compete for one or two positions&quot;. After many failures, at the end of 2022, Meng Qiping decided to move to northern Guangxi to participate in a talent introduction interview in a certain county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recruitment information shows that the position Meng Qiping applied for at that time was a &quot;party and government talent position without restriction on majors&quot;, with a total of 10 positions open. On the day of the interview, he unexpectedly discovered that due to the epidemic, only 6 applicants came to participate. &quot;This means that as long as you attend the interview, you can get a job,&quot; Meng Qiping said happily. He didn&#39;t know it at the time, but this job would just add to his years of wandering life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, one month after resigning from the county’s Culture, Broadcasting, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Meng Qiping once again recalled the choice he made a year ago, admitting that “at that time Some are eager to get ashore.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 13, 2023, a job fair in Mengzi City, Yunnan Province.

One of them also had an overseas study background, and two of them had a background in overseas study. They were assigned to the County Culture, Broadcasting, Sports and Tourism Bureau, which “refreshed the highest educational level for employees in the history of the bureau.” Lu Min, who lives in the northern county of Henan, mentioned that the people introduced with her all graduated from 985 and 211 universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, the &lt;span>;Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Social Science Literature Press jointly released&lt;/span>;&#39;s &quot;Social Blue Book: 2023&quot; &quot;China Social Situation Analysis and Forecast&quot; mentioned that between 2018 and 2021, more and more college students want to abandon first- and second-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and return to third- and fourth-tier small and medium-sized cities, small counties, grassroots towns and rural work . In August 2023, the 2022 College Students Returning Home Employment Survey Report released by the educational research organization Max Research Institute also mentioned that the proportion of graduates returning home for employment is on the rise, and nearly half work within the system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The flow of talents into the county system is exactly what the local government expects. Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, a county with a permanent population of only 650,000. In an interview event in early 2020, a total of 316 master&#39;s and doctoral graduate students from prestigious domestic and foreign universities such as Fudan University, Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Columbia University participated. &lt; span>;In the end, only 23 people passed and are expected to obtain career establishment&lt;/span>;. In the official publicity, the interpretation that “the competition for talents has reached a record high” is highlighted in bold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters show that since August 2023, more than 10 provinces have announced talent introduction plans for public institutions in their counties and cities, and single recruitment is open. The number of positions mostly exceeds 100, among which full-time master&#39;s and doctoral graduates are the main recruitment targets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We have been doing this for a long time by taking part of our staff to recruit people in other universities and colleges. It is just a term used to introduce talents in recent years. It was made more clear.&quot; Wang Meng works in the Organization Department of a municipal party committee in a southwest city. According to her memories, the province held a talent work conference in 2021, which specifically listed talent work as a focus and established talent at the provincial and municipal levels. Work first area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Wang Meng’s observation, counties and districts that can vigorously recruit talents usually have a leading industry or leading industry. “Like Anshan, the local area will definitely choose some steel industries. Professional talents in this field can do research and have development prospects.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Small cities show their enthusiasm as much as possible. Wang Meng&#39;s area provides free talent apartments and house purchase subsidies for high-level postgraduate talents. If they work for more than five years, there is also a cash reward. Children&#39;s education, parents&#39; medical treatment, free physical examinations, etc. are also supporting benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, an unavoidable fact is that the boom in talent introduction is also driven by policy factors. Southern Weekend reporters searched and found that the talent introduction work first appeared in the public eye, which can be traced back to 15 years ago. In 2008, places such as Rizhao in Shandong, Hebi in Henan, and Fuzhou in Jiangxi took the lead in proposing to open up some positions in public institutions to introduce high-level and high-quality talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Two years later, in May 2010, the Second National Talent Work Conference was held, &quot;National Medium and Long-term Talent Development Plan Outline (2010-2020)&quot; Issued. Zhang Lei, an economist at the Qingxu County Personnel Examination Center in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, mentioned in the paper that under the influence of policies, party and government agencies and public institutions across the country have also begun to pay attention to talent work and regard it as an important part of the reform of public institutions. carry out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A staff member of the Organization Department of Yongjing County Party Committee in Gansu Province recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that &lt;span>; his county started to introduce talents in 2020. Initially, In two years, I can recruit two or three times a year&lt;/span>;, but the number will be less in the future. &quot;I can&#39;t say when the next time will be. It&#39;s possible that we won&#39;t recruit next year, or we may recruit again. The establishment is dead, and if the unit is short of people, we will definitely recruit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As the number of participating counties and cities increases, the “level” of talent becomes higher and higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2023, Yucheng, a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Dezhou City, Shandong Province, a city famous for Dayu&#39;s flood control, issued an announcement, It is planned to introduce 6 Ph.D.s to work in municipal units under the jurisdiction of five departments including the Yucheng City Government Office, Science and Technology Bureau, Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau, and Commerce Bureau. This is the first time that local talent recruitment has been specifically targeted at Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the past, our standard for recruiting talents was that only master&#39;s degree students and above were required.&quot; A reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the other party in the name of applying for a job, and the person responsible for the recruitment Staff from the social sector explained on the phone that the reason for raising standards was “mainly to attract talents.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Selection methods specially formulated for talents also emerged. Different from the preliminary review, qualification review, written examination, interview and other processes required for regular recruitment in public institutions, the human resources and social affairs department will organize a group of applicants from time to time to conduct centralized interviews within one to two months through staff introduction and doctoral introduction. Just choose. As of late September, the centralized interviews for the first batch of applicants have ended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The imported talents are relatively easy to use.&quot; Wang Meng introduced that the talent introduction in his city will arrange for face-to-face communication between employers and job seekers, &quot; Asking about your intentions, future development direction, everything can be asked, and the evaluation and understanding of a person will be clearer and deeper.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The level of economic development is here”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More generous salaries and better benefits, in the aforementioned paper , Zhang Lei mentioned that in order to attract talents, &quot;giving money, giving houses, and giving household registration&quot; have become the &quot;three axes&quot; of local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the person directly responsible for the talent introduction work, Wang Meng knows very well that many highly educated talents come here for the settlement subsidies and cash rewards. Before the epidemic, the brain drain rate in her area had always been relatively serious. To solve this problem, welfare benefits were indispensable. &quot;After all, there is a war for talent everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, after winning the iron rice bowl as expected, highly educated talents may also encounter disappointment in actual work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before joining the job, Meng Qiping paid special attention to the fact that the county&#39;s &quot;monthly basic salary is 4,000, and the performance at the end of the year is 30,000&quot; for introducing talents. In the local The conditions are quite good. But it wasn’t until he officially joined the company in March 2023 that he learned that in addition to the 4,000 yuan monthly talent subsidy for the first five years, the more than 4,000 yuan received at the end of the month already included a monthly prepayment performance bonus of 1,500 yuan, which would be paid at the end of the year. The actual performance does not exceed 10,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Like Meng Qiping, Lu Min&#39;s actual salary after joining the company was also lower than expected. &quot;I received more than two thousand, and with the recent cancellation of assessments, the salary was reduced every month.&quot; Thirty or forty yuan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Meng Qiping concluded afterwards, &quot;The salary levels in various places are not very transparent, which means that you have to go in to know the true salary levels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most counties and cities that introduce talents can offer limited treatment conditions. In the aforementioned telephone consultation, the Southern Weekend reporter had not yet asked about the target salary level. He only mentioned another prefecture-level city, and a staff member of the Yucheng City Human Resources and Social Security Department added, &quot;We are a county-level city, and the salary you expected must be the same.&quot; There is a difference because the level of economic development is here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the staff member, after the introduced talents with master&#39;s degree become regular workers, they will receive The salary is about 4,300 yuan. If you graduate from a &quot;double first-class&quot; university, there will be an additional monthly subsidy of 1,300 yuan. The salary for a doctoral degree must refer to the document standards published by the government&#39;s official website. However, Southern Weekend reporters did not find the details of the relevant documents on the official website. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Being acclimatized&quot; is also Du Lin&#39;s experience. In 2022, through talent introduction, she got a job as a business editor in a prefecture-level city in central Gansu with a population of less than 500,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Du Lin graduated from an ordinary university in the west with a bachelor&#39;s degree. She is the first employee recruited by the company through talent introduction. Most of her colleagues are junior college graduates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;After studying for a few more years, I was always told that I was too old to find a partner. Several male colleagues in their thirties and forties also introduced me to A local unemployed man, they always ask me, how was your conversation.&quot; This very traditional value evaluation made Du Lin feel uncomfortable. &lt;span>;Although she is also from another county&lt;/span>;, &quot;My family never said that I should get married as soon as possible, and they never said that I should stop studying when I get older.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nearly two months after joining the company, Du Lin did not receive clear information about her position. &quot;Department, office, workstation, none of these.&quot; She was once assigned to debug the online conference equipment. After the meeting started, a male colleague came over and said that the leader&#39;s office needed to be cleaned, &quot;I need to learn how to be a good person first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are already cleaning staff in the unit.&quot; Du Lin guessed that maybe using her to give her colleagues a &quot;sense of superiority&quot;, but delving deeper, the reason It may be that the entry of highly educated talents has brought them career anxiety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Meng Qiping also had similar feelings. He imitated the tone of his colleagues: &quot;Hey, what&#39;s the difficulty with this? Don&#39;t be afraid, there are graduate students here to support them. Graduate students can do everything.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Dilemma of Over-education&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;Graduate students who “know everything” may be doing the job they are least good at. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When they first joined the company, Du Lin and Meng Qiping both worked in the unit&#39;s general office. This is seen as a regular way to sharpen newcomers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While working in the general office, Meng Qiping and other colleagues needed to follow a roster. When it&#39;s his turn, he has to rush to the office early in the morning, and then start various chores: making tea, booking a bus, taking photos, and printing name tags. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Meng Qiping’s view, this job does not require a graduate student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The accumulated pressure and confusion finally erupted late at night after a basketball game during the May Day holiday. When Meng Qiping returned home after one o&#39;clock in the morning, he suddenly questioned his years of hard study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In fact, there is no difference in promotion and work content between talent introduction and those who are admitted to public institutions through other methods.&quot; As a recruiter of talent introduction , Wang Meng does not deny that the county’s talent carrying capacity is not as sufficient as imagined. There was once a doctor who was admitted to her urban area through selective transfer, but because &quot;he was doing very basic work&quot; and it was not in line with his expectations, he was not able to retain it in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the view of Luo Rundong, director of the Institute of Labor Economics of Shandong University (Weihai), such educated people engage in jobs that do not match their academic qualifications, which leads to their The phenomenon that the skills learned cannot be fully utilized is over-education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In a paper study published in 2010, based on the comprehensive social survey data CGSS, Luo Rundong and Peng Mingming, a doctoral student at the Institute of Economics of Nankai University, conducted a study on different Statistics on overeducation among employees with higher education in type units. The results show that the proportion of overeducation in administrative agencies and public institutions is generally higher than that in business units, and among business units, state-owned or state-controlled enterprises are higher than those in foreign-funded enterprises and private enterprises. At the same time, when other conditions are equal, party and government agencies, public institutions, state-owned or state-controlled enterprises and other units will further continue to increase the proportion of over-education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, the phenomenon that everyone yearns for and needs higher education is more obvious than when the paper was published. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, when a Southern Weekend reporter consulted the Talent Office of Libo County, Guizhou Province as a master&#39;s student at a 211 university, the staff first repeatedly Emphasizing that the work content does not conflict with the majors studied, he then revealed that in the early stages of work, the tasks assigned by the unit to introduce talents are generally very easy, such as sending and receiving documents or writing materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past year, Lu Min thought that she was just doing a &quot;screw&quot; job. It only took a short time for her, who graduated from human resources management, to get started with sending and receiving files. The one-year probationary period passed quickly, and she was on the verge of becoming a full-time employee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recruitment season has recently arrived, and the bureau has welcomed batches of interviewees. One day, Lu Min recognized at a glance that one of the interviewees was his high school classmate. The other party quickly recognized her, &quot;You actually work here?&quot; The surprise in her tone could not be concealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The other party&#39;s grades in high school were not as good as mine. This time he applied with a graduate degree.&quot; Thinking of his undergraduate degree, Lu Min had a feeling Shame. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But what makes her feel even more &quot;inferior&quot; is the small county where she works and lives. &quot;Most of my college classmates are in Shanghai. Among middle school and high school classmates, most of them are in Beijing, as well as Shenzhen and Guangzhou. They often post in their circle of friends about where they traveled and what exhibitions they saw on the weekend.&quot; And in the county town , not even a few shopping malls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lu Min thought, &quot;If I can be admitted to a graduate school, my life may open up another situation.&quot; On September 18, 2023, she hid the secret from her parents. I submitted my resignation letter and concentrated on preparing for the postgraduate examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August, four months after joining the company, Meng Qiping also decided to leave. He learned that one of the six people who came ashore gave up before joining the company. Among the remaining five people, apart from myself, one also has the idea of ​​​​resigning, and two others hope to &quot;be admitted to the civil service.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He saw a talent dilemma unique to the county. &quot;On the one hand, the county needs talents to build it, but after the talents do come, it seems that many times they cannot play the role they should play.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Like a After closing the loop, Meng Qiping’s next plan changed back to studying for a Ph.D. He hopes to get a teaching position in a domestic university after completing his PhD. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Lu Min, Meng Qiping, Du Lin, and Wang Meng are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子有偿代骂被拘：Al正推动新业态进化，购买服务者是否担责？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260134]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a security case has attracted attention. According to the Zhuzhou police report, the man Yi Mou uses paid &quot;scolding&quot; on the Internet as a way to make money. According to the customer&#39;s requirements, he personally attacks and insults specific objects through WeChat and phone calls, and charges fees ranging from 20 to 30 yuan. , causing serious impact on the victim’s work and life. From February 2023 to now, Yi has made more than 3,000 yuan in profits by relying on such illegal services. Currently, Yi has been placed under administrative detention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that practitioners of scolding have been punished. In August 2023, the police in Changsha, Hunan Province captured Li Moudong, who posted a &quot;swearing&quot; advertisement online, and detained him in accordance with the law. According to police investigation, Li Moudong helped customers verbally abuse others online on designated social platforms for 100 yuan a day, and has made illegal profits of nearly 10,000 yuan since October 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The risk of &quot;scolding on behalf of others&quot; is that the person being scolded may call the police. Article 42 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;repeatedly sending obscene, insulting, threatening or other information that interferes with the normal life of others&quot; constitutes a violation and shall be detained for not more than five days or fined not more than 500 yuan; if the circumstances are serious, In serious cases, the offender shall be detained for not less than five days but not more than ten days, and may also be fined not more than five hundred yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the police punish the illegal behavior of &quot;screamers&quot;, there are also several issues worthy of in-depth consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, scolding has already broken the law. Do people who purchase &quot;scolding services&quot; need to bear legal responsibility? In other words, by spending this money, the buyer can &quot;use someone&#39;s mouth to curse others&quot;, thereby achieving the effect of &quot;using a borrowed knife to kill people&quot;, and can still exempt themselves from responsibility? Judging from this case, Yi has replaced at least a hundred people to insult others. If there are cases of &quot;serious consequences&quot;, then the person who paid for the &quot;mouth substitute&quot; has become a hidden &quot;behind-the-scenes manipulator&quot; , you can brazenly &quot;buy evil and curse others&quot;. Is this because the target of each business is too small and not handled? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that if two or more people jointly commit infringement and cause damage to others, they shall bear joint and several liability. Anyone who instigates or helps others commit infringements shall bear joint and several liability with the perpetrator. Theoretically, the person who purchases the scolding service is the source of the infringement, which meets the identification standard of &quot;instigating and helping others to commit infringement&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, &quot;swearing&quot; itself is a very broad and general concept, and there is a problem of how to define it. Which verbal attacks are considered curses, and which curses are personal attacks and insults that are suspected of illegal crimes? There is still a very large range of distribution, and it is not suitable to generalize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also &quot;swearing&quot; in a broad sense. Verbal counterattacks after encountering injustice are obviously not comparable to organized and premeditated verbal bullying and insults. The former can be regarded as legitimate in language no matter how you say it. defensive. In addition to the &quot;cussing service&quot;, there is also the &quot;quarrel service&quot;. This kind of &quot;storm in the teapot&quot; is less likely to be suspected of illegal crimes. Following this line of thinking, the old-school literati&#39;s &quot;knowing yourself and your enemy&quot;, &quot;stopping in moderation&quot;, &quot;speaking elegantly&quot; and &quot;retreating in order to advance&quot; - these &quot;elegant scolding&quot; tactics used today are still outdated, and I am afraid it will be more difficult to classify them as words and deeds that violate the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that the reason why these scolders were detained was because their words and deeds met the definition of personal attack and insult, constituted an infringement on the victim, and were even suspected of illegal crimes, rather than general &quot;swearing someone&quot;. The development of mobile Internet technology has only made personal attacks, insults, slander and defamation more convenient, and has even turned it into a &quot;service&quot; that can be traded on the platform. Technology itself is neutral, and there will naturally be &quot;services to praise&quot; and &quot;services to scold&quot;. These &quot;emotional needs&quot; are rooted in the depths of human nature. &quot;Screaming service&quot; seems to be a new thing, but its core is quite old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, since &quot;cussing service&quot; is a new business format supported by Internet technology, technological progress may also give rise to newer &quot;swearing&quot; business formats. This is probably worthy of careful consideration and strict enforcement. Alert. Generative AI, represented by the large language model ChatGPT, may bring about an even crazier and unimaginable future. It is conceivable that today&#39;s &quot;scolding services&quot; are just real people &quot;taking orders and scolding&quot; on the Internet. What if it is &quot;AI scolding&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, AI-trained face-changing, onomatopoeia, and composition are almost real. It is completely possible to clone a real person’s digital life in cyberspace, and then use a virtual number/account to intervene in reality. If you are scolded by a real-life AI dummy with a voice that is exactly the same as in real life, or by a completely virtual AI dummy, and the content of the insult is highly consistent with your personal information, and the person involved is difficult to trace , the various troubles and legal risks caused by it will definitely be several orders of magnitude higher than today&#39;s scolding by real people, which will bring greater difficulties to the protection of personality rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if you think that someone in real life has scolded you, in fact, it is just a third party that has purchased an AI scolding service that only extracts and uses the timbre and voice characteristics of a real person. You may mistakenly have an actual interaction with the real person. Conflict, and all this is the result of manipulation by a third party. The problem this creates is to some extent isomorphic to video head-swapping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the recent popularity of &quot;AI dubbing&quot; as an example. From Trump to singer Taylor Swift, everyone can speak Mandarin with their own distinctive voice. &quot;AI is replacing voice workers.&quot; The prospect is not far away. If this technology is also used to &quot;scream on someone&#39;s behalf&quot;, the consequences will be even more sensational than if a real person scolds someone on their behalf. Imagine that one day your communication tool receives &quot;insulting audio and video messages&quot; from relatives, friends and even celebrities. The mental damage alone may be enough for you, and it will also take time and effort to resolve misunderstandings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, in the face of the nascent &quot;cussing service&quot; and the raging generative artificial intelligence, it is indeed necessary to proactively clarify its boundaries and define which swearing behaviors are infringing and which are suspected of illegal crimes. Purchase Do service providers who curse others need to be held accountable? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
