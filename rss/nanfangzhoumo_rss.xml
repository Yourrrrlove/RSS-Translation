I&#39;m talking about Andie MacDowell, the heroine of Four Weddings and A Funeral. The poet Zhu Zhu once uniquely compared Juliette Binoche to &quot;the first bite of ice cream in spring.&quot; Yes, everyone has their own bite of ice cream. The difference is that his ice cream is French, while mine is from the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; is the representative of British comedy movies, but the overwhelming joy of it has been almost forgotten. What can&#39;t be washed away is Andy&#39;s eyes, which look tenderly and lovingly at Hugh Grant, who always looks hasty and clumsy, and at me, who is also hasty and clumsy. She is the kind of person who is very tolerant and restrained, allowing you to make mistakes and holding you lightly in her arms. During the time when I was in my twenties, Andy had been quietly watching my sadness, unobtrusively and undazzlingly, like the simple and strange flower in my youthful dreams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, she was forgotten. Time flies by, the soul is lost, the youthful mood gradually fades, and there are no more dreams at night. As a result, Andy became a coordinate of his youth, precipitated in the light and shadow of time, eroded and lost day by day. When the world of mortals rises, what is left in our hearts? I once read some beautiful short poems and was filled with emotion, so I wrote a quatrain: &quot;After eating, my heart is drowning in the Zen of my pen, and I am disappointed with the dripping of powder and kneading cakes. I was also very fond of it back then, and once wrote about the spring breeze.&quot; When spring ice cream Melting little by little, the strange flowers in the dream withered little by little, Andy, none of us can resist the wand of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since ancient times, beauties are like famous generals, and they are not allowed to grow old in the world.&quot; In the blink of an eye, Andy is in his sixties, right? It is no longer easy to find negative photos of her youth online. Audrey Hepburn, Catherine Zeta Jones, Sophie Marceau, Maggie Cheung, Rosamund Kwan, Christy Chung, Zhu Yin... How should they think lovingly of their radiant beauty when they look in the mirror at midnight? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Seventy Years Back in Time&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/vpztrExXnh6Tp89qxkOGuwoYdapFWWvdWJCAtFYr. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/vpztrExXnh6Tp89qxkOGuwoYdapFWWvdWJCAtFYr.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;256018&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Somewhere in Time &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;The flowers bloom in spring, the wind in autumn and the setting sun in winter, I once ignorantly thought so in my melancholy youth.&quot; On the university campus in the 1980s and 1990s, there was no other music than Luo Dayou&#39;s This song touches our heartstrings even more. I am a person who is quite sensitive to time. When I was a teenager, I would be immersed in her magic and couldn&#39;t extricate myself. Later, after seeing the dead end, the legend, the ups and downs, and life and death, I finally understood time. If you can heal everything and carve everything, you are already heading towards the vicissitudes of middle age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I have been fanatical about Time Movie for a long time. Because movies are one of the ways to understand time. It has infinite capabilities of hypothesis and expression, and it brings me endless emotion and sadness. A movie that also belongs to youth: &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (Somewhere in Time). At the end, when the male protagonist sees today&#39;s sun and moon inlaid on the coin, the beauty from seventy years ago instantly moves to that end of time. Falling, how melancholy it is forever and ever, and how terrifying it is! Time-themed movies usually have amazing visual effects, like &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, like &quot;Black Hole Frequency&quot;, like &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, but this one does not. It relies on time itself to create the effect, like a cup of pure Kuding. Tea, without any added flavour. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kcje4CxpjUT7PJW6oRdUxKTdl0CK4IBNe9MBXEOL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;453&quot; height=&quot;664&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kcje4CxpjUT7PJW6oRdUxKTdl0CK4IBNe9MBXEOL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256019 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Shawshank Redeption&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is the taste of time? To me, at least, those black and white video tapes with blurry, pulsing images are one of a kind. After I fell in love with movies, those black and white lights and shadows accompanied me for a long time, day and night, morning and night, like dreams that I couldn&#39;t see clearly or remember. &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, &quot;Last Year at Marienba&quot;, &quot;Fang Fang&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, and yes, there is also the one that can never be skipped &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (The Shawshank Redemption). After watching it dozens of times, I still can&#39;t quite explain its charm. Or, any elaboration and explanation are unnecessary. As the Buddhists say, will it become a &quot;textual barrier&quot;? However, there are some sentences that I can still retrieve from the warehouse of my memory at will (thanks to the subtitles of the video version, their Chinese version is no less than Stephen King): &quot;We can&#39;t understand what is being sung in it, but it seems to be an angel The sound made the thick stone wall disappear without a trace. At this moment, the prisoners in Shark Castle regained their freedom.&quot; &quot;Busy, busy living, or busy dying.&quot; &quot;Some birds cannot be shut down because of their wings. It’s so glorious.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Birds with brilliant wings lingered in my once bleak world. Without their chirping, we would always be prisoners of despair. Staring at the beating black and white light and shadow that night, listening to the &quot;hissing&quot; echo of the video tape, my prison disappeared without a trace, and I came to the moon and stars, savoring the taste of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a movie. To me, it may mean a way to survive, the wind settles the dust, and the sky brings happiness and auspiciousness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[网络实名制，在争论中从“幕后”走向“前台”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259710]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 11:45:10&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Big V will face a real-name test at the front desk. Nongjian Illustrations&quot; src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/d7b3195417.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/d7b3195417.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256323&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Large Vs will face a real-name test at the front desk. Nong Jian Illustration&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The entire network of self-media will implement a real-name system at the front desk.&quot; In mid-October 2023, &quot;Hong Rong&quot;, a financial blogger with more than 3.5 million fans, posted this news on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost at the same time, Weibo CEO Wang Gaofei began to display his real name in the personal information column of his Weibo account &quot;Come and Go&quot;, marking &quot;self-media front desk real name&quot;, and communicated with Weibo netizens many times Leave messages and interact on related topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 31, Weibo issued an announcement stating that it will soon guide self-media accounts with more than 1 million fans in social current affairs, military, finance, medical, legal and other professional fields to fill in real-name information, and will expand in the future. to more than 500,000 fans. Bilibili, WeChat, Douyin, Kuaishou and other platforms also issued similar news, implementing a front-end real-name system for &quot;head self-media&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years or so, the online real-name system has experienced a development process from scratch, from partial to comprehensive. In 2011, local documents required Weibo users to &quot;real-name in the background and voluntarily in the front-end.&quot; In 2017, Weibo fully implemented this requirement. Now, now, the real-name system has gradually moved from behind the scenes to the front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This quickly triggered heated social debate. In the past, almost every time a request for a real-name system came out, there would be similar debates. Supporters believe that the online real-name system can enhance the standardization and responsibility awareness of online activities, help eliminate rumors and obscene information, reduce online violence or illegal crimes using false information, and improve the sense of security in netizens&#39; lives. Opponents believe that, The real-name system not only affects information security and the sense of relaxation in public expression, but also endangers the security of personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real-name system at the front desk has changed personal information from centralized collection by a small number of platforms to being exposed to a wide range of public views. Its impact is more complex and diverse. Some scholars have publicly suggested: &quot;This is a big matter and it is not appropriate to do so.&quot; Launched hastily.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Weibo is not alone&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend observed that as of the evening of October 31, many Weibo influencers with more than 1 million fans were still &quot;anonymous&quot; in the front office. On Bilibili, Douyin and other platforms, most leading self-media in related fields do not see real-name information displayed on their personal homepages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Weibo announcement, the platform will guide users to fill in the information that needs to be displayed at the front desk. According to Wang Gaofei&#39;s internal beta information on his personal page, the personal information that may be displayed in the future includes real name, gender, zodiac sign, occupation, IP location, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Private messages sent to big V from Weibo previously obtained by Southern Weekend show that the first batch of front-end self-media accounts need to be real-named before the end of October, and accounts with 500,000-1 million fans need to be real-named by the end of December. completed before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the aforementioned private message mentioned that the real-name system requires all platforms on the entire network to implement it uniformly. &quot;As for the front-end real-name system, Weibo, Douyin, Tencent and other platforms have communicated and fought for it many times. If it causes trouble, , you can feedback your opinions and suggestions through your own channels, or you can submit them to us for forwarding.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to find from the announcements released by major platforms that the real-name system for top self-media front desks has become inevitable. The main difference between platforms lies in the number of fans of the first batch of real-name self-media accounts. Except for Douyin, which started with accounts with more than 500,000 fans, the others all started with accounts with more than 1 million fans, and then gradually expanded to more than 500,000 fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is no standard and clear implementation document this time. Each platform can only explore and implement it based on its own platform attributes and past review priorities.” A platform insider revealed. According to him, front-end real-name verification is slightly different from content review. The latter has a certain amount of &quot;discretionary space&quot;, while the former must be implemented when it reaches a certain level. The platform it is on will have a larger number of fans and greater influence in a certain field. The account priority requires the front desk to real-name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the background of this incident, the aforementioned private message stated that it was to further implement the &quot;13 Self-Media Management Regulations&quot; of the Cyberspace Administration of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a notice, in order to strengthen the management of &quot;self-media&quot;, consolidate the main responsibilities of website platform information content management, and improve the normalized management system and mechanism, requiring website platforms to &quot; &#39;We-media&#39; engaged in the production of information content in the fields of finance, education, medical and health, justice and other fields shall undergo strict verification and display the names of their service qualifications, professional qualifications, professional background and other certification materials on the account homepage, and add the label of their field.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Affected by multiple factors, I feel that responding to the increasingly serious problem of cyber violence and building a better online content ecosystem are top priorities.” Wang Sixin, a professor at Communication University of China, said that in recent years, cyber violence has Problems occur frequently. Starting in 2022, relevant departments have intensively introduced a number of targeted measures, and platform parties have further implemented their respective responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Sixin is a consulting expert of the Cyberspace Administration of China and has participated in legislative work including the Cybersecurity Law and the &quot;Regulations on the Ecological Governance of Network Information Content&quot;. He explained that because big Vs often have wider social influence, and some have complex backgrounds and diverse purposes, some big Vs have their own teams behind them, and their online activities, including speeches, endorsements, etc., all have commercial interests. In practice, It is difficult to rule out the possibility of misleading the public for economic interests, which will have many negative impacts on the healthy development of the information ecology. &quot;The front-end real-name system will help these big Vs enhance their sense of social responsibility and risk awareness, and standardize their behavior in cyberspace.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Gaofei responded on Weibo to the issue raised by some Weibo users who were unwilling to use their real names. You can clear your followers to delete them below 1 million, or change your posts to other fields. The aforementioned private message also mentioned that it can help users &quot;detect spam fans and help clean them up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Weibo announcement also stated that for users who should be real-name but do not want to be real-name, the traffic and income of the account will be partially restricted, including restrictions on recommendation stream display, hot search display restrictions, advertising sharing restrictions, Tip income limits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The relevant details are still unclear at the moment. The platform should balance the real-name and personal information security issues at the front desk, such as the obligation to inform in advance and whether it is necessary to display the work unit and position information of the big V at the front desk. , whether the employer can refuse, and whether there is an exit mechanism if the individual is unwilling, and procedures need to be set up.&quot; said Zhu Wei, deputy director of the Communication Law Research Center of China University of Political Science and Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is still a big difference in what kind of personal information is displayed at the front desk.” Zhu Wei gave an example. For example, if a doctor influencer discloses that his occupation type is a doctor, it may be more important than disclosing his employer and company. Job information can further reduce the occurrence of cyber violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the aforementioned announcement on Weibo, the content related to the protection of front-end information is: users who are not logged in, have not passed the verification of real identity information, have abnormal behavior, and have been dealt with recently are prohibited from viewing the real-name information of other users&#39; front-end information. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;More than twenty years of evolution and changes&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As early as 2002, Li Xiguang, a professor at the School of Journalism at Tsinghua University (now the School of Journalism and Communication) mentioned in an interview with a TV station that he suggested that the National People’s Congress Anyone should be prohibited from being anonymous online, sparking heated public discussion. This is considered by the media to be the first time that the online real-name system has entered the public eye in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following ten years, the online real-name system began to be partially tested. In 2004, the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening Campus Network Management in Colleges and Universities&quot;, and the &quot;Internet Real-Name System&quot; was officially written into official documents, and college online forums began to implement user real-name registration; in 2005, Tencent, according to the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau&#39;s &quot;About &quot;Notice on Carrying out the Clean-up and Rectification of Online Public Information Service Sites&quot;, which requires real-name registration of the founders and administrators of QQ groups; in 2006, the State Administration of Press and Publication proposed the &quot;Real-name System Plan for Online Games&quot;, requiring online game players to register with their real names in order to Distinguish between adults and minors...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until 2011, the real-name requirement once again aroused great concern. That year, Beijing promulgated the &quot;Several Regulations on the Development and Management of Microblogs in Beijing&quot;, proposing that Weibo users must use their true identity information when registering, and implement &quot;real names on the backend and voluntary on the frontend.&quot; Subsequently, Weibo publicly stated that it would implement real-name registration for new users and gradually improve the real-name review of old users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why Weibo users are required to have their real names, in 2012, Wang Chen, then director of the Cyberspace Administration of China, responded publicly, saying that Weibo has the characteristics of fast dissemination, great influence, and wide coverage, and has a strong social influence. Mobilizing power. Weibo has changed the previous public opinion communication pattern. While reflecting social conditions and public opinion, enriching information services, and conducting public opinion supervision, it has also enabled the rapid spread of harmful information such as negative public opinion, obscenity, and fabricated lies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since 2009, Weibo has used its influence on the platform to have a huge impact on the formation and direction of public opinion on many issues involving public interests. What happened in China around 2011 Many public events have become hot fodder on the Internet.&quot; Wang Sixin further explained that among the series of management measures that were subsequently formed, many requirements were formed based on learning these lessons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Sixin gave an example. When the Wenzhou high-speed train accident occurred in July 2011, “the Internet was filled with various rumors about the accident, which gradually became outrageous and evolved into attacks on China’s high-speed rail and national economic development model. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The existing management is very unsuitable and poses new challenges to network information security and social harmony and stability.&quot; Wang Chen mentioned in the above speech. &quot;The regulatory requirements for online real names were also proposed and gradually implemented under this background.&quot; Wang Sixin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the &quot;Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress on Strengthening Network Information Protection&quot; was promulgated and implemented. In the form of a legal document, it is clearly required that online service platforms need to register users with real names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next peak of attention regarding the online real-name system occurred around 2016. The Cybersecurity Law was promulgated in 2016 and came into effect in 2017. Article 24 of the Law stipulates: When signing an agreement with a user or confirming the provision of services, network operators shall require users to provide their true identity information. If they do not provide their true identity information, they shall not provide services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2017, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Internet Comment Service Management Regulations&quot;, requiring all online platforms to authenticate the real identity information of registered users in accordance with the principle of &quot;real-name backend and voluntary front-end&quot;. Otherwise, no comment service will be provided to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same year, Weibo issued the &quot;Announcement on Weibo&#39;s Promotion of Completing the Real-Name System for Accounts&quot;, requiring all users to complete real-name verification before September 15, 2017, otherwise they will no longer be able to send comments and new posts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The promulgation of legislation and related normative requirements was also prompted by some events. Wang Sixin introduced that the Snowden &quot;Prism&quot; incident in 2013 (the electronic surveillance program implemented by the United States) aroused high-level attention to national network information security, and related work such as legislation on network security has also been accelerated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the telephone real-name system also provides convenience for online registration. In 2013, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology required users to provide their true identity information when handling landline, mobile phone, broadband and other Internet transfer services. And in late 2015, the operator stopped serving non-real-name numbers. As for online service platforms, most of them use mobile phone number verification to complete the registration review. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The pros and cons of foreign real-name systems&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At present, supervision of the Internet environment is relatively common internationally. For example, the United Kingdom has introduced a Communications Data Act, which stipulates that network users need to register personal information such as names and addresses; mobile online communication services in the United States need to be bound to social security numbers that can identify personal information; Germany has also introduced laws to supervise the Internet, providing Merchants operating online, Internet mail, telephone and mobile phone users shall implement real-name registration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also places that require the public to provide personally identifiable information to market-based service platforms. Southern Weekend learned from netizens in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and other countries, as well as several Chinese people who have lived in many countries, that currently enterprise service platforms in many countries do not require direct real-name registration, but some countries require binding The email address or mobile phone number associated with the personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not many people ask for real names at the front desk. In Wang Sixin&#39;s view, the front-end real-name system requirements for network service platforms this time are &quot;essentially detailed specifications for the management of front-end network real-name systems. Many tasks are not carried out in one step and need to be carried out step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the past process of China&#39;s online real-name system, almost every step has attracted great attention, especially the real-name system on market-oriented platforms such as social platforms and information services, which often triggers heated debates among all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend searched past literature and reports and found that supporters of the real-name system generally believe that the anonymity of the Internet has given rise to a series of problems such as online language violence, rumors and defamation, Internet fraud and even illegal crimes. In recent years, frequent incidents Internet violence incidents have also caused serious physical and mental harm to the parties involved in some social incidents, and the real-name system is a good solution to the above problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Nowadays, many self-media accounts are operated by a team, often with some commercial demands. We-media accounts with a large number of fans must disclose their true identities and be responsible for their online speeches.&quot; Zhu Wei said. He added that in lawsuits related to cyber violence cases, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff, but the personal information of the alleged infringing subject needs to be obtained from the platform through the court, and the front-end real-name system can also simplify this process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most opponents believe that the real-name system inhibits the enthusiasm for public discussions, expressing true thoughts, and putting forward valuable opinions, and is not conducive to venting emotions and easing conflicts. In recent years, many corruption cases have been detected through anonymous reporting online, and the real-name system will put pressure on the reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Both social psychology and communication science have confirmed that in an environment where personal information tends to be transparent, people’s words and deeds also tend to follow the herd, and people who follow the herd rarely have a sense of innovation. From From the perspective of social development, real-name identification at the front desk is not conducive to encouraging people to think actively and be brave in innovation.&quot; said Lao Dongyan, a professor at Tsinghua University Law School. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Dongyan also believes that the real-name system at the front desk may not solve the problem of cyber violence, but may instead give rise to some kind of &quot;precision cyber violence.&quot; &quot;I started using Weibo in 2022, and I have always used my real name. I have been verbally abused and insulted many times because of my participation in public discussions. Some people not only reported me online @my unit, but even reported it offline. The real-name system at the front desk is for these People provide convenience.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the concerns about the real-name system, one issue runs throughout: the online real-name system will affect the security of personal information. This worry is not groundless. In 2017, experts from the Ministry of Public Security told the media that the generalization of the online real-name system has indeed affected personal information security. The more information collected such as personal ID numbers and facial recognition, the more information will be leaked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been related incidents in China. In 2016, Xu Yuyu, a student from Shandong Province, was defrauded by a fraudulent phone call to pay for college. She was depressed and eventually died of cardiac arrest. According to media reports, the student information leaked in this case was caused by criminals attacking the candidate information system of the local education bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also international precedents. In 2005, a girl in South Korea encountered online violence because she refused to clean up pet feces. As a result, the girl was forced to drop out of school and became mentally ill. In order to control cyber violence, starting from that year, the South Korean government began to gradually require the public to implement real names on the Internet. It was gradually promoted in gradients and fields, supplemented by measures such as improving legislation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By 2010, a total of 167 Korean websites implemented the online real-name system, mainly large portals, news websites and shopping platforms. However, between 2010 and 2012, large-scale user information leaks occurred on multiple platforms, the largest of which affected 35 million people, while South Korea&#39;s total population in 2010 was only over 48 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2012, South Korea’s online real-name system was suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Telecom fraudsters are very rampant now. It can no longer be solved by blocking individual mobile phone numbers, because the other party often uses a virtual number and may receive fraudulent calls anytime and anywhere.&quot; Lao Dongyan said , she herself has been woken up by fraudulent phone calls in the middle of the night many times, and she can no longer bear the disturbance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant departments are also strengthening the protection of personal information security.

The figures running freely and the laughter from time to time are the vibrant scenery of the campus. However, &quot;Xinhua Viewpoint&quot; reporters recently investigated in some places and found that some primary and secondary school students were restrained for 10 minutes between classes. Except for drinking water and going to the toilet, they were not allowed to leave the classroom or even leave their seats at will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;School Protection Regulations for Minors&quot; formulated by the Ministry of Education clearly requires that no unnecessary restrictions shall be placed on students&#39; freedom of speech and behavior such as legitimate communication, games, and activities outside the classroom during recess and other non-teaching time. . So, why do some schools strictly control students’ 10-minute recess activities? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;The campus becomes quiet during the break&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The 10-minute break between classes is commonly known as the break. It is an important time for primary school students to adjust their learning status, relieve fatigue and communicate with each other. The reporter recently visited many primary and secondary schools and saw that the campus became quiet because students were required not to leave the classroom at will during elementary classes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is understood that this phenomenon has been around for a long time. A 2019 survey of more than 1,900 parents showed that 75.2% of parents believed that the phenomenon of &quot;quiet recess&quot; is common in primary and secondary schools around them, and is most prominent in primary schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Parents of students from many primary schools in Changchun City reported that the school requires their children not to play on the playground during recess and can only go to the toilet or move quietly in the corridor. One parent said that the child&#39;s class teacher stipulated that the child should stay in his seat except when going to the toilet during class breaks. &quot;Some students were punished for fighting in the classroom during recess. Since then, they no longer dare to run around after class.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many schools in Haikou City The primary school arranges for teachers on duty to patrol each floor and strictly prohibits students from chasing and playing in the corridors. Some schools also select young pioneers to form a duty team, which scores and assesses the behavior of students in each class during class. Once chasing and fighting are found, points will be deducted from the class. The assessment is directly linked to the selection of civilized classes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Similar phenomena also exist in some primary and secondary schools in Hebei, Guizhou and other places. The reporter saw in a primary school in Langfang City, Hebei Province, that except for some students going to the toilet, most of the children were sitting in the classroom chatting after class. Zhang Xu (pseudonym), a primary school teacher in Zunyi, Guizhou, said that some class teachers do not allow students to play on the playground during recess. &quot;This is too depressing for children&#39;s nature.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many parents of primary school students in Haikou City said that only a few teachers attach importance to students’ physical exercise between classes, and most teachers will try their best to make active primary school students more active in the name of emphasizing discipline. Be quiet, euphemistically called &quot;civilized rest.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Over-restraint&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;is not good for&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;children Healthy Growth&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why are students frequently over-restrained during primary school breaks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some teachers interviewed said that mainly because of the limited space and dense crowds, accidents such as collisions often occur when students play on the playground. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A teacher from a primary school in a county in Hebei Province said that once a student encounters an accident such as a collision during recess activities, the school not only needs to apologize to the parents, but may also involve financial compensation. For this reason, the school simply emphasizes discipline between classes and reduces children&#39;s outing activities. &quot;It is better to do less than to do more.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, the objective conditions of the site are also an important reason. Many teachers interviewed reported that many urban school teaching buildings are built relatively high, with only 10-minute breaks between classes. The elevators are not enough for students to run up and down, and the narrow corridors easily create the risk of crowding and stampedes. Moreover, the playgrounds of urban schools are small and often have too many children to move around. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many parents believe that restricting children’s recess activities is mainly for schools and teachers to facilitate management and reduce trouble. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some grassroots educators interviewed also believe that excessive restrictions during small classes violate the regulations of the Ministry of Education and are also a manifestation of extensive and lazy school management. Strictly limiting the scope and intensity of activities for primary and secondary school students during recess can reduce the chance of accidents, but it is not conducive to the healthy growth of children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This approach will suppress the child&#39;s nature and is not conducive to physical development. Psychologists believe that walking out of the classroom and exercising properly during recess can relieve study pressure and promote interpersonal communication. Yin Ruofeng, deputy chief physician of the Spine Surgery Department of the Third Hospital of Jilin University, said that heavy academic load and decreasing physical activities are important factors affecting the body posture and spinal health of primary and secondary school students. Going out of the classroom to move your limbs during small classes is beneficial to students&#39; health. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Data from the National Health Commission show that the overall myopia rate among children and adolescents in my country in 2022 is 53.6%. According to the interviewed ophthalmology experts, participating in outdoor sports is an important means to prevent and control myopia. Being &quot;crowded&quot; during primary school hours will lead to a reduction in the time for outdoor sports among primary and middle school students and an increase in the probability of myopia. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, this approach can easily make students feel tired of studying. Shen Wei, vice principal of the primary school of Changchun Foreign Languages ​​Experimental School, pointed out that staying in the classroom for a long time may cause students to be mentally burned out; students use recess to adjust and relax their bodies and minds, which can help them concentrate on the next class. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Resolutely implement national protection regulations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Relevant regulations for minors&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Regulations on the Protection of Minors in Schools&quot; officially implemented on September 1, 2021 requires that schools shall not set up management measures that infringe on students&#39; personal freedom, and shall not punish students during breaks and other non-teaching time There are unnecessary restrictions on the freedom of speech and behavior such as legitimate communication, games, and activities outside the classroom; schools should improve the management system to ensure that students can use the school&#39;s sports venues and facilities for physical exercise during and after class. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/be1e0af9353df253306c927ce8cf3a43.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/be1e0af9353df253306c927ce8cf3a43.png&quot; data-key=&quot;256262 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Primary school students of Changchun Foreign Languages ​​Experimental School skip rope on the playground during recess&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter learned from the interview that some schools use small classes to carry out a variety of outdoor activities. For example, the elementary school of Changchun Foreign Language Experimental School has opened basketball, volleyball and other activity areas, and students can choose according to their personal interests. At the same time, with the support of the school, the head teacher also encourages students to go out and do activities as much as possible. Liancheng Primary School in Congtai District, Handan City, Hebei Province is not only equipped with sports equipment such as basketball, football and badminton, but also equipped with books, chess, backgammon and other items in the classroom for students to use during class. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The teachers and parents interviewed believe that returning small classes to children requires comprehensive measures. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As an important part of campus safety management, schools must carry out campus safety hazard inspections on a regular basis and make campus safety work detailed and solid. Shen Wei introduced that there are 1,980 students in the primary school of Changchun Foreign Languages ​​Experimental School in grades one to six. In order to ensure the safety and order of students’ recess activities, the school dispatched 6 physical education teachers, 6 teachers of all grades and student cadres to monitor the corridors, stairs, The playground is inspected and on duty, and most students can go up and down the stairs in an orderly manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Experts suggest that the education authorities should issue guidance, strengthen the supervision and management of schools through supervision, and return recess time to students as much as possible. Schools should also strengthen skills guidance and safety education for students in sports and games to reduce the probability of accidents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Interviewees believe that when campus management is standardized and school facilities are safe, society and parents cannot simply pass the responsibility to schools and teachers when campus safety problems arise. . A working mechanism for government departments or third-party agencies to standardize the handling of campus safety incidents can be established to reduce the probability of direct conflicts between schools and parents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“年纪大了，玩芭比有点幼稚”：棉花娃娃寄托的情感生意]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259679]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On April 30, 2023, Kunming, citizens brought cotton dolls to the Jacaranda Taking photos on the avenue.

It was a commemorative photo she took of her cotton doll &quot;Luffy&quot; on her birthday a few months ago - slightly different from ordinary dolls, this character from the anime &quot;One Piece&quot; has a disproportionately large head. Her eyes were bright and she had a silly grin, completely covered by her iconic crescent moon bangs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I saw Luffy sitting upright, with a row of small cakes in front of him. Under the photo, Zhi Tao typed out a line of words sincerely: He is one year older. Happy birthday! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Because of the incident (Haidilao), I was afraid of being criticized by others.&quot; Zhi Tao is a cotton doll lover. According to the popular gameplay in this circle, Players are like raising children, buying clothes and accessories for their dolls, and taking them on trips, parties, and even birthdays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, because the outside world does not understand these behaviors, the players who call each other &quot;baby friends&quot; have been criticized a lot. &quot;Netizens said it was a mental illness, and the words were unpleasant.&quot; Zhitao has just entered her junior year. Like many children, she is introverted and sensitive, and is troubled by poor interpersonal communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cotton doll is a trendy doll that has quietly become popular among young people recently. On October 16, 2023, when a consumer brought his cotton doll to Haidilao for dinner, the waiter refused to serve the doll for his birthday. This matter became a hot topic on social platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What kind of charm does cotton doll have that can make young consumers generous?

That day was the end of the May Day holiday, and my roommate had not returned to school yet. During the day, she had a quarrel with her mother, and was asked repeatedly on the phone why she didn&#39;t go home during the holidays. &lt;p>; &quot;Get up and go to the store to buy a few cakes to celebrate the birthday of this &quot;little friend&quot; who has grown up with you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Usually, comic book authors announce character birthdays on the company website. Luffy is the protagonist of the popular Japanese anime &quot;One Piece&quot;. His brave, fearless, persistent and optimistic character, as well as his pure, kind, affectionate and righteousness towards his friends, made Shitao fall in love with him. &quot;Maybe, I have also wished that I was such a person, or that I had such friends.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She is the only one in the dormitory, and she has been used to it since she was a child. Zhi Tao, who lives alone, puts the cotton doll Luffy on the bedside on the table, and then puts a small cake on it, and instantly seems to have an emotional connection with this little friend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhitao explained that when it comes to cotton dolls, she actually belongs to a typical &quot;poor family&quot; model. Even so, she can&#39;t help but see beautiful accessories occasionally. Bought to match Luffy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I am considered a wealthy child.&quot; 19-year-old Zhou Zhou is also a child lover. She raises a cotton doll named Wanzi. When I first got it, Wanzi was just a &quot;naked baby&quot; - no decoration. Seeing the beautiful hairpins, hats and scarves, Zhou Zhou wanted to buy them for his doll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She also buys clothes for Wanzi. At first, she just bought some baby clothes, but she felt that the sizes were always a bit off. Later, I simply went to customize some clothes like I did with the &quot;group purchase&quot; dolls, but the price was slightly more expensive and the cycle would be longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Zhou said that in addition to dressing up dolls, she sometimes also &quot;makes things happen&quot;. For example, when doing homework, let Wanzi accompany you, and then record the conversation as a video and upload it to the Internet platform. &quot;While doing homework, I asked Wanzi, isn&#39;t your father a doctor? Can you know this question?&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the circle, those dolls with character prototypes are called &quot;dolls with attributes&quot;. The character prototype of Wanzi comes from a female-oriented online game. In the game, a female character played by Zhou Zhou falls in love with a doctor named Charlie Su, and Wanzi is the fruit of love. &quot;The Maruko doll is a baby in the three-dimensional world. This kind of companionship and sustenance has a sense of reality and makes me feel very happy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In real life, I have never seen a boy as good as Charlie Sue.&quot; The character setting of Charlie Sue is romance, kindness, and respect for women. Zhou Zhou said that there are five male protagonists in the game. She didn&#39;t pay attention to Charlie Su at first, but she was gradually attracted by his attentiveness, especially when she saw a book &quot;Fang Siqi&#39;s First Love Paradise&quot; hidden in Charlie Su&#39;s study. 》, I was instantly moved by this detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Zhou is a &quot;science and engineering girl&quot; majoring in biology. She is a sophomore in Hefei, Anhui and has never been in a relationship in real life. &quot;Every day when I open Weibo and Tik Tok, there are warnings of &#39;marriage fear&#39;.&quot; She said that as a woman, she often senses unfriendly behavior from the outside world, which makes her cautious about entering a relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cotton dolls often play a role in expressing emotions for children, and these emotions have a wide range of aspects. &quot;I have lacked companionship since I was a child.&quot; Zhitao explained that she grew up in a single-parent family. Her mother ran a factory by herself. She was usually very busy and had to go home very late every day. During her long teenage years, she spent her time alone at home watching TV, scrolling through her cell phone, and reading comic books. &quot;On May Day, I actually wanted to go back, but when I went back, I would be alone at home. It would be better to stay alone in the dormitory.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Except for the road Fei, Shibatao also ordered a prototype doll named Kageyama Shigeo, the male protagonist of the Japanese anime &quot;Mob Psycho 100&quot;. Kageyama Shigeo has super powers and can help many people, but he feels inferior and depressed because he is not good at dealing with people. Through painful growth, he slowly accepts his imperfect self. &quot;Luffy and Kageyama Shigeo are two sides of my personality.&quot; Shibato said, putting the two dolls of Luffy and Kageyama Shigeo on the bedside, and she felt very at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Some doll friends will decorate doll houses for cotton dolls.

(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Baby’s mother: “If no one sells it, I will make it myself”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhitao’s memories, give After Luffy&#39;s birthday, she secretly posted the photo on QQ space, which few people paid attention to, and occasionally looked through it herself, &quot;mainly because I was afraid that others wouldn&#39;t understand and would criticize you.&quot; Therefore, when the controversy over the Haidilao incident came out, she was so sensitive that she quickly deleted this trace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She is grateful for the appearance of Cotton Doll, allowing her to find similar people who can understand each other&#39;s behavior. Zhitao explained that the most popular cotton doll is the most popular animation, game, drama series or &quot;idol&quot; at the moment. Because it has just become popular, the peripheral products are not perfect enough. If fans want to express their love, they need to DIY. Make emotional cotton dolls. &quot;There are few ways to express emotions, so just make it yourself.&quot; Among them, they are divided into nurturing dolls and idol dolls, which are to raise the dolls like children, or to pursue them like celebrities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Slightly different from the outside world’s perception, anime “popular idols” like Luffy have many fans, but they are not actually the most popular dolls. &quot;Because &quot;One Piece&quot; has been popular for a long time, there are so many peripherals, and there are many choices.&quot; Shigeo Kageyama, who Shimomo also likes, is not a popular doll either, because this anime is a little old, but it is relatively unpopular. I know it and like it. There are not many people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, when Zhitao sees posts or merchandise about her favorite characters on social media, she will feel very happy, &quot;Ah, I didn&#39;t expect such unpopularity.&quot; characters, but also dolls.” She introduced that there will be like-minded people on social platforms who post posts to solicit fans and buy cotton dolls together in groups. If fans are interested, they take the initiative to contact the poster, and then they are pulled into a group buying group on an e-commerce platform to communicate. &quot;At least 50 people can be recruited to form a group.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This sponsor is called &quot;baby mother&quot; by children&#39;s friends. &quot;Baby mothers are like fans in the rice circle, and they are actually fans.&quot; She explained that usually cotton dolls are usually designed by the mother in advance by someone or herself. The pattern and size of the doll will be announced in advance and everyone&#39;s opinions will be solicited. , if you are dissatisfied with the design, you can make suggestions for modifications. After the final draft is finalized, the baby&#39;s mother will go to the factory to make a sample. Once the sample is satisfactory, it can be shipped. This cycle usually takes several months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Usually more than 900 yuan for a sample.&quot; Tongmian (online name) is the legendary baby mother. She said that before starting a group, she must first Draw sketches, because I have some basic drawing skills, so I make my own design draft. After finishing the painting, I post it to social platforms to find people. The jargon is called &quot;squatting&quot;. We will see if there are many interested people. If we can find some people, we will start to form a group. After joining the group for discussion one after another, we will go to the factory to make prototypes. &quot;If you are satisfied, we will make the goods. If you are not satisfied, we will continue to make samples. You can make samples up to three times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tong Mian said that she does this job part-time, which is equivalent to generating electricity for love. At first, she liked the character Qi Sili in the game &quot;Love of Light and Night&quot; very much, so she wanted to own a doll, but she searched all major e-commerce platforms and found nothing. &quot;No one sold it, so I decided to make it myself.&quot; After the doll is ready, the total cost of the doll plus postage is 70 yuan, and the co-sleeper will also give you some trinkets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the communication group, in addition to exchanging opinions on drawings and samples, the baby&#39;s mother will also announce the production progress, communication details with the factory owner, and cost details. The whole process is more like DIY for fans. Mothers will gain a sense of accomplishment when they see their ideas turn into reality little by little. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Enterprise: “Niche, too small batch size”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhitao discovered that a mother with a baby clearly stated in the group announcement that she refused to Adults &quot;start a group&quot;. &quot;A doll costs tens of dollars, which is quite expensive. I&#39;m afraid that it has already left the factory, and parents find it too expensive to return it.&quot; She explained that the number of doll friends who like a specific character is already small. As far as the factory is concerned, Their order quantity is too small, which is the minimum limit that can be started for production. &quot;Baby mothers use love to generate electricity. If they return the goods, they have to pay for it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, although a doll costs fifty or sixty yuan, It&#39;s not cheap, but Zhitao thinks it&#39;s reasonable. &quot;After all, there are too few people who like this.&quot; She said that some big IPs have very rich derivatives and a wide range of choices, while peripherals for niche hobbies can only be obtained through DIY methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The entrepreneur Feng He (pseudonym) is not an animation fan or a fan. He noticed that the cotton doll was not a hobby, but an instinctive business sense. However, after entering this track, he gradually realized why this new thing appeared in the form of fan groups. &quot;It is mainly a niche, quite special, and not as easy to do as imagined.&quot; Feng He is the founder of a cotton doll company in Zhongshan, Guangdong. At first, he found a factory to make the dolls, but later he purchased a machine to make the dolls himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The main difficulty is that the batch size is too small.&quot; Feng He said that there are many categories of cotton dolls, but the production quantity of a single category is very limited. There are a large number of toy OEM factories in the Pearl River Delta, but for them, the number of each order is too small. &quot;They mainly take orders from foreign countries, mainly exporting.&quot; When he first got involved in this industry, he had to communicate frequently with factories, which consumed a lot of time and energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Feng He was still unwilling to miss this emerging market, so he established a company, bought machines, and decided to open a factory and do it himself. “The most important costs are personnel and management costs.” He said that a mature sample maker’s monthly salary is at least 8,000 yuan, a machine tool master needs 6,800 yuan, and embroidery workers and handymen’s monthly salary is more than 6,000 yuan. A mature embroiderer can sew up to 40 dolls a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if the factory has been opened, the way they receive orders is still to post posts and gather enough people before starting a group. Depending on the size of the doll and the quantity of the group, the pricing will be different, with the range mostly fluctuating by tens of yuan. &quot;Although it is very popular now, in the big market of dolls, it is a very small segment.&quot; He said that cotton dolls are actually an upgrade of the manufacturing industry. After the growth of large-volume export trade slowed down, only There is a way out to undertake this type of small batch and multi-batch demand, which puts forward higher requirements for corporate management and cost control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if external entrepreneurs gradually intervene, flexibility and smallness are still the characteristics of this industry. Data from an e-commerce platform shows that the number of cotton doll merchants with transaction records has increased from less than 400 in 2017 to nearly 10,000 by the end of 2020, an increase of more than 20 times in three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Brand&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The first question is&lt;/strong >;&lt;strong>;Copyright&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xiao Qi (screen name) is also a cotton doll lover. I work in a small cotton doll company near the water and have collected more than 20 dolls. As a serious gamer, she would change the doll&#39;s bangs and clothes, put blush on her face, and check in and take photos at Internet celebrity coffee shops. She also made space on the wardrobe and built a &quot;baby house&quot;. She followed the tutorials on social media to hang hooks, pictures and other props to decorate the doll&#39;s room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the development of the industry, the cotton doll accessories industry chain has developed. On the e-commerce platform, there are all kinds of jewelry, baby clothes, shoes, blush, as well as baby bags, baby houses, furniture and other peripheral accessories for cotton dolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Limited by the exclusivity of the audience for attribute dolls, many cotton dolls cannot be mass-produced, but many accessories can be used universally without copyright risk. , on the contrary, mass production will be realized earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;As I get older, playing with Barbie is a bit childish, and Cotton Doll is just right.&quot; Xiaoqi is not a fan of fans or animation, she mainly likes Cotton Doll It was to fulfill my childhood dream of being a princess. Her more than 20 cotton dolls are all non-attributed dolls, with no corresponding IP prototypes and no copyright authorization issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;To take the branding route, the first problem to solve is copyright.&quot; Rua Baby Bar founder Ye Yingdan was the first to notice that cotton dolls could grow into an industry one of the people. Ye Yingdan was originally a marketing director of an e-commerce platform. As early as 2019, she monitored in the background data that &quot;cotton doll&quot; became a hot-searched product as a keyword. After careful study, we found that cotton dolls are a very interesting category. The products are soft and cute. No matter the designers, manufacturers or the audience, they are all very young, mostly middle school and college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The cotton dolls purchased in 2018 are based on a Korean boy band.

(Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The whole thing is still in a relatively rough stage.&quot; Ye Yingdan said that because it is mainly a product driven by interest, early group DIY The cotton dolls are shared by fans and are not strictly commercial activities, so they do not involve strict copyright issues. Of course, the quantity of a single category is also very limited, and the production cycle is very long. Even a few months after the group was launched, the product has not yet been released. Some baby friends have even forgotten about it. There have been cases where the baby&#39;s mother &quot;ran away with the money.&quot; Condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The supply chain ecology is very backward, and the upstream cannot solve the problem of genuine authorization, and the development of the entire market is very restricted.&quot; Ye Yingdan explained that despite the many problems, she Still see the vigorous development. That year, Cotton Doll’s GMV (total transaction volume within a period of time) on their platform grew by more than 300% in one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the star-chasing culture that originated in South Korea to quietly becoming popular in China, it quickly expanded to various circles of animation, film and television, and games, and developed its own Circle culture. Ye Yingdan feels that this industry has great potential and she wants to create a brand of cotton dolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ye Yingdan found that a major difficulty in the early stages of starting a business was how to accurately select IP with sustainable commercial value, &quot;Because the cotton doll itself has a prototype, and the product is not It is not the brand that takes the lead, but the product that is created by the fans of the character.” After exploration, we found that compared to idols and animation, the IP of film and television dramas is more suitable for brand operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We go to the market to check the hot dramas that are waiting to be broadcast, and try our best to &#39;sign all the ones that should be signed&#39; to ensure that we continue to produce peripherals for popular characters in TV dramas. .&quot; Ye Yingdan said that branded cotton dolls can only cover the characters that are popular and highly recognized by the public, while many unpopular IPs still require hobbyists to DIY them. Therefore, in the future, the group-style small workshop model will still exist for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“直博生主动选择博转硕”背后：博士过剩正在愈演愈烈丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259693]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the &quot;China Youth Daily&quot; report, &quot;direct doctoral students actively choose to convert from Ph.D. to master&#39;s degree&quot; has become a new phenomenon in colleges and universities. The reporter interviewed several direct doctoral students. Their reasons for choosing to &quot;transfer to a master&#39;s degree&quot; vary: some are not suitable for PhD life, some are because the subject is too difficult, and some are worried about their employment after graduation. For them, changing to a master&#39;s degree or simply entering the workplace is an &quot;active diversion.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why these doctoral students choose to quit is naturally due to rational considerations of cost-benefit ratio. If the subject is too difficult and they cannot get a degree even after studying for several years, the resulting sunk cost will be staggering; even if they go through all the hard work to get a doctorate, if they cannot find a job after graduation, the opportunity cost they will pay will be astonishing. It is bound to be too big to bear; even if they work hard to get a teaching position, many &quot;green peppers&quot; still have to fight hard to escape from the various &quot;promote or leave&quot; assessment quagmire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that a doctoral student spends several years studying for a degree, and then tries his best to find a stable scientific research and teaching position. This is an out-and-out &quot;adventure&quot;, while his peers I&#39;m afraid I have spent the past few years getting married and starting a business. In comparison, studying for a Ph.D. is indeed like a &quot;gamble&quot;. It was based on these considerations that several parties involved in the report decisively chose to &quot;stop losses&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this phenomenon is the problem of &quot;mismatch&quot; and &quot;excess&quot; in the selection and training of domestic doctoral students. The so-called &quot;mismatch&quot; means that many students who are not suitable for Ph.D. study mistakenly enter the path of Ph.D., and after enrolling, they are shocked to realize that they are not the material; the so-called &quot;surplus&quot; means that there are too many doctoral students trained by universities, showing an oversupply situation. The society cannot provide enough jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the first batch of doctoral students independently trained in China received their degrees in 1983, the number of doctoral students recruited and graduated every year in the country has been growing rapidly for the past 40 years. According to the Ministry of Education&#39;s &quot;2022 National Education Development Statistical Bulletin&quot;, a total of 82,300 doctoral students will graduate in 2022. This year, the number of doctoral student enrollment exceeded the 130,000 mark, and the number of doctoral students reached 556,100. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a vertical perspective, China&#39;s doctoral student enrollment exceeded 10,000 in 1995, reached 60,000 in 2009, and reached 130,000 in 2022. In less than thirty years, the number has surged by more than a dozen. times; horizontally, China surpassed the United States as the world&#39;s largest doctorate-granting country as early as 2008, and currently the number of new doctorates awarded each year exceeds that of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the number of people enrolling and graduating with doctoral degrees in China reaches new highs every year; on the other hand, the “superfluity of doctoral students” is becoming more and more serious. News about &quot;PhDs in nuclear physics becoming urban managers&quot;, &quot;Doctors in medicine applying for school doctors&quot; and &quot;PhD students vying for primary and secondary school teachers&quot; appear frequently. The dilemma of &quot;green pepper collective anxiety&quot; often shows the embarrassment of doctoral students being &quot;overqualified for their talents&quot; in the job market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is there a surplus of doctoral students? This is related to social needs, traditional concepts, and policy guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Society’s demand for doctoral students often changes with the economic situation and industrial structure. Once the &quot;demand side&quot; of society cannot create enough scientific research and teaching positions, it will not be able to accommodate enough PhD employment. If PhDs in science and engineering can still find use in corporate R&amp;D departments, PhDs in humanities and social sciences may only have public and teaching positions left to fight for, and these positions are one carrot after another, and the growth rate is limited after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The traditional Chinese concept is that &quot;those who excel in learning will become officials&quot;. It seems that contemporary Ph.D.s, like the ancient scholars, belong to the reserve army of public officials. Standing at the entrance of the ivory tower, the first-year Ph.D. students regard &quot;Doctor&quot; as a status and even a talisman, and are &quot;on the waiting list&quot; like &quot;passing the Jinshi examination&quot;. In reality, the &quot;grading advantage&quot; of doctoral students joining civil servants is also reinforcing this concept. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, modern society is not ancient times after all. The rapidly growing number of doctoral students far exceeds the imperial examination quota of only a few hundred people a year in the past. The number of public positions that the society can accommodate may not keep up with the excess number of doctoral graduates. . If the relationship between &quot;social demand&quot; and &quot;doctoral supply&quot; cannot be realized, then the starting point of students&#39; doctoral studies will inevitably be out of touch with the connotation of a doctoral degree, and they will become farther and farther away from the &quot;original intention&quot; of a doctoral degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ph.D. degrees, from the outset, are different from other degrees in the education system. Pursuing a doctorate is known as an arduous journey of &quot;studying alone at the farthest edge of knowledge&quot;. Those who obtain a doctorate are also hailed as &quot;creating new knowledge for mankind&quot;, which means that they can independently complete research and expand humankind. cognitive boundaries. A vivid description is that if the human knowledge system is regarded as a concentric circle with a radius that is constantly expanding outward, then a doctor is someone who touches the outermost circle and makes a breakthrough outward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand for doctoral students in modern society often changes with the economic situation and industrial structure. Changes on the demand side should naturally force adjustments on the supply side. In the face of changes in social needs, universities should proactively adjust their doctoral training plans. Public universities must make good use of taxpayers&#39; higher education funds, and private universities must be worthy of large donations from alumni. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the United States as an example. The financial pressure brought about by the COVID-19 impact has caused many prestigious universities in the United States to reduce enrollment or even suspend enrollment in many doctoral programs. Doctorates in liberal arts who do not make money are the first to bear the brunt. According to U.S. media statistics, in 2021 alone, dozens of elite universities in the United States have suspended enrollment in more than 140 doctoral programs in the humanities and social sciences. After the emergence of the large language model ChatGPT, doctoral majors in the field of artificial intelligence have won a new round of favor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are you suitable for a PhD? Does the doctoral team need you? Does society need you as a doctoral student? If you answer these questions carefully, pursuing a doctorate can be called a &quot;two-way journey.&quot; At the same time, universities should also think deeply about how to proactively adjust the enrollment and training plans for doctoral students in response to social needs, instead of &quot;cultivating PhDs like mushrooms&quot;, which will lead to the problems of degree involution and a surplus of PhDs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[京津冀及周边地区多城市启动重污染天气预警]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259698]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 07:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Since October 22, a PM2.5 pollution process has occurred in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding areas.

Experts pointed out that since October 22, regional meteorological conditions have turned unfavorable and PM2.5 pollution has gradually accumulated. As of 8:00 on October 30, a total of 32 days of moderate or above PM2.5 pollution occurred in 16 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Expert analysis shows that from the perspective of meteorological conditions, the recent meteorological conditions in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding areas have been relatively unfavorable, which can easily lead to the accumulation and transformation of pollution. Since October 22, the cold air activity in the region has been weak, and the surface temperature and lower atmospheric relative humidity have been higher than normal, which can easily cause regional pollution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of regional pollution emissions, the activity levels of regional industrial enterprises, heavy trucks and the number of straw fire points have increased month-on-month, and pollution emissions are showing an increasing trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of industrial sources, since late October, regional industrial electricity consumption has increased significantly compared with the previous period. Among them, the increase in electricity consumption in cement, brick and tile industries has been more obvious, and the electricity consumption in steel, coking, petrochemical and other industries has increased significantly. The battery capacity is basically the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of mobile sources, the recent traffic flow of heavy trucks in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas has been at a high level since autumn and winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of non-point sources, a total of 325 fire points were discovered in the area from October 21 to 28, of which the number was larger in Tianjin, Hebei (Cangzhou, Zhangjiakou), Henan (Zhoukou, Zhumadian, Luohe) and other places. many. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter learned that many cities in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding areas have initiated heavy pollution weather warnings.

BMI refers to weight (kilograms) divided by the square of height (meters). BMI less than 18.5 is considered thin, 18.5 to 24.9 is normal, 25 or more is overweight, and 30 or more is obese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, a recent article in Nature magazine stated that this standard for diagnosing obesity is flawed. First of all, obesity is considered obese when the total amount of fat accumulated in the human body and the amount distributed in different parts exceeds a certain amount. However, BMI does not measure the amount of fat in the human body and the amount distributed in various parts, so it cannot reflect whether people are really obese. , how serious the degree of obesity is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, even if the BMI is the same, people of different ages and genders have different fats. For example, older people generally have more fat and less muscle than young people, and women tend to have more fat than men. body fat. Furthermore, even if adults of similar age and sex have the same BMI, they may have different amounts of body fat and the amount of fat distributed in different body parts and organs. Studies have found that fat accumulated in internal organs, such as the liver and heart, is more harmful, while fat accumulated in the waist is more harmful than fat accumulated in the buttocks and legs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, there are racial differences in BMI. BMI is a standard based on measurements of white people and does not apply to other races. Asians with a lower BMI are at greater risk for diseases such as heart disease than white people, possibly due to differences in body fat percentage and distribution in different parts of the body. Therefore, the World Health Organization recommends that Asians use a lower BMI to measure overweight and obesity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to some drawbacks of the BMI index, the current obesity standards based on the BMI index may overestimate the global obesity situation. On August 17, 2023, the journal &quot;Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism&quot; published an article titled &quot;Prevalence of Obesity and Related Complications in China: A Cross-Sectional Real-World Study of 15.8 Million Adults&quot;, depicting the obesity map of China. , among the 15.8 million adult subjects, 34.8% were overweight and 14.1% were obese. In addition, the &quot;2023 World Obesity Atlas&quot; released by the World Obesity Federation draws an obesity map for the world, predicting that 400 million people will be overweight or obese in the next 12 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, both articles use BMI as a measure of obesity to estimate the number of obese people. Obviously, such a judgment may not be accurate. Moreover, some people have long expressed different opinions on using BMI to measure obesity, and have proposed supplementary and improved standards, which can measure body fat rate and use this together with BMI to measure obesity. However, because measuring body fat percentage is cumbersome, it has not been widely promoted and applied so far. It is relatively simple to use BMI. At the same time, some people simply judge whether they are obese based on their appearance, so losing weight on their own may have some consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the biggest consequences is the widespread use and abuse of weight-loss drugs, which has brought about a series of problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, new weight loss drugs have been launched one after another, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), semaglutide and tirzepatide. Some have produced good results, with significant weight loss, some can reduce body weight by 21%, and semaglutide has also been shown to reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular problems. However, this type of drug was not originally developed to lose weight, but to treat diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latest generation of anti-obesity drugs mimic a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is involved in appetite regulation. Since then, semaglutide, which is similar to GLP-1, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 (trade name Ozempic) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and was later approved for the treatment of obesity in 2021 disease (trade name: Wegovy). Since then, the FDA approved the sale of tisiparatide (trade name Mounjaro) in 2022 for the treatment of diabetes, but it was also later used to treat obesity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the increasing number of adverse effects has begun to raise concerns about the side effects of these obesity drugs on people. The main hazards now identified are gastrointestinal problems and loss of muscle mass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the University of British Columbia in Canada published an article online in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (JAMA) on October 5, 2023, pointing out that drugs currently used to treat obesity have great potential. harmfulness. Researchers surveyed a large health insurance database of obese patients. 4,144 people took liraglutide (also a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity), 613 654 people took semaglutide and 654 people took bupropion-naltrexone (another weight loss drug). The incidence of biliary tract disease (per 1,000 person-years) was 11.7 for semaglutide, 18.6 for liraglutide, and 12.6 for bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence rates of inflammation were 4.6, 7.9 and 1.0 people respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The conclusion was that taking glucagon-like peptide-1 was associated with a lower risk of pancreatitis, intestinal obstruction, and gastroparesis (gastroparesis is a Conditions that slow or prevent the movement of food from the stomach to the intestines are associated with an increased risk, but not biliary tract disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previous clinical trials have shown a link between GLP-1 drugs and gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, constipation and rare cases of pancreatitis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For tilsiparatide, the more obvious side effect is muscle loss, leading to muscle weakness. But this situation still requires long-term monitoring and research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 23:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[个人信息泄露是电诈产业链一环：了解套路，提高警惕丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259685]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 21:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some netizens reported that they received fraudulent calls after searching for flight information and booking tickets on a map app. In the name of the airline&#39;s customer service, the other party claimed that the flight was canceled due to mechanical failure and asked him to provide his Alipay account for compensation. The caller can report the netizen&#39;s name, phone number, ID number, flight information, etc. Netizens believe that their personal information has been leaked and used for telecommunications fraud, and hope that relevant departments will investigate strictly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response, the Civil Aviation Administration of China responded that it is preparing relevant documents to further strengthen the protection of important data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flight cancellation compensation&quot; has recently become a popular means of telecommunications fraud, with some passengers losing even more than 2 million yuan. Fraudsters can accurately report the passenger&#39;s name, ID number, and flight information, which undoubtedly means that the information related to the ticket purchased has been leaked. However, the ticket booking process is cumbersome and involves many parties. Online travel platforms, airlines, ticket agents, as well as intermediaries and terminal systems such as TravelSky and operators, there is a risk of data leakage in any link. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of fraud has become a popular electronic fraud method recently, and passengers can receive fraudulent calls soon after booking a ticket, which shows that the leakage of passenger flight information has become large-scale. Leaking passenger flight information is not only an illegal and criminal act in itself, but also provides a target for electronic fraud crimes. It is the upstream of the black industry chain of telecommunications fraud. Timely crackdown on flight information leakage is of great significance to cutting off the upstream of the industry chain and reducing telecommunications fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When people think of telecom fraud, the first thing that often comes to mind is fraud crimes such as &quot;pig killing&quot;, &quot;online gambling&quot;, and &quot;rebate fraud&quot;, as well as popular news such as the proliferation of telecom fraud parks in northern Myanmar. Especially after thousands of people involved in fraud in northern Myanmar were recently handed over to the Chinese police, many people thought that the electronic fraudsters had been caught in one fell swoop, and that electronic fraud would be greatly reduced in the future. But this is a misunderstanding, or just a good wish. Telecom fraud has become a huge industry, not only overseas, but also within China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The telecommunications frauds people see are actually just one part of this huge criminal industry chain, and upstream and downstream there are also illegal crimes such as theft of personal information and money laundering. Fraud groups also have data processing departments. After collecting huge amounts of personal information, they analyze and process it to find &quot;high-value&quot; targets. They use different fraud scripts for different fraud targets, and finally execute the script to make you fall for the scam. . The source of all this is personal information. The more detailed and specific the information, the easier it is to apply personalized scripts to conduct &quot;precise fraud.&quot; The script for flight cancellation compensation is this kind of precise fraud, which takes advantage of passengers&#39; anxiety about flight cancellations and blocked itineraries, and the fraud has a higher success rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, the possibility of information leakage is almost everywhere. The flight information leak mentioned above is just one of them. Large-ticket consumption areas such as buying houses and cars are also the hardest hit areas for information leakage. After many people buy a house, they will receive sales calls for decoration, furniture and appliances, etc. After buying a car, they will receive sales calls for insurance, car products, etc. It&#39;s just for sales, so it&#39;s not bad, but since this personal information can be sold to people who sell furniture, home appliances, and insurance, of course it can also be sold to telecom fraudsters, and this information containing real estate and vehicle-related content can easily be used. Carry out &quot;precision fraud&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, a more serious information leak may be a large-scale data leak of some websites. The popularization of Internet applications, while bringing great convenience, has also sharply increased the risk of personal information leakage. Whether it&#39;s sending express delivery, ordering takeout, taking online ride-hailing, or registering as a member, each platform has a massive amount of users&#39; personal information. Once these platforms fail to provide adequate security protection and are breached by hackers, a large amount of user information may be leaked. Previously, a user data leak occurred on a certain short video platform, with the total amount of information reaching 2 billion. After this information is leaked, it will exist permanently on the dark web, cannot be eliminated, and is constantly being sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Personal Information Protection Law has very specific provisions on preventing the leakage of personal information. Major websites should strictly abide by the &quot;minimum enough&quot; principle and only collect and store necessary user personal information to reduce the damage caused to users by possible information leakage. After all, no matter how you protect it, it is difficult to guarantee that it will be foolproof and never leak. Even if safety is technically guaranteed, there may still be situations where it is difficult to prevent house thieves. The police have uncovered more than one case in which telecom company employees provided user phone numbers and other information to fraud groups, and even provided phone lines to fraud groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The criminal law clearly stipulates that selling or providing citizens’ personal information to others, if the circumstances are serious, constitutes a crime. According to relevant judicial interpretations, selling or providing whereabouts information is used by others to commit crimes, or knowing that others are using citizens&#39; personal information to commit crimes and still selling or providing personal information to them are considered &quot;serious circumstances.&quot; Therefore, if passenger flight information is leaked, no matter where it occurs, it is suspected of a crime, and the police should open a case for investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public should also increase their awareness of personal information protection and try not to provide personal information on the Internet. In particular, they should not be greedy for petty gains and provide personal information to unknown websites, and should not scan unknown QR codes casually. Secondly, we must improve our awareness and ability to prevent e-mail fraud. It is necessary to learn more about telecommunications fraud routines, be more vigilant against common fraud scripts such as online gambling and bill fraud, and verify information such as flight delays and refunds through official websites, social accounts, customer service telephone numbers, etc. Telecommunications fraud is difficult to guard against, and the routines are updated very quickly. Even if you encounter a scam script that is enough to disturb your mind, such as &quot;family members are in hospital&quot;, you must increase your concentration, don&#39;t be gullible, and try to contact your family members first. Many people&#39;s personal information may have been circulated on the dark web. It may be difficult to avoid telecom fraud in the future. To prevent fraud, you may have to rely more on yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 21:55:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[针对深圳欢乐谷过山车碰撞事故，三部门联合约谈华侨城集团]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259696]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 20:46:59&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 31, in response to the roller coaster vehicle collision accident of Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town Happy Valley Tourism Company, the State Administration for Market Regulation, in conjunction with the State Council Security Council, The committee office and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council jointly held an interview with OCT Group Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interview pointed out that the Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to safety production work, requiring that the concept of safety development be firmly established, the implementation of corporate main responsibilities be strengthened, the bottom line of safety production be firmly maintained, and the safety of people&#39;s lives and property be effectively safeguarded. The large-scale amusement facility safety accident that occurred at the Happy Valley Tourism Company in Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town caused many injuries and exposed problems such as insufficient implementation of safety subject responsibilities, poor safety management, ineffective risk prevention and control, and inaccurate reporting of accident information, resulting in adverse social impacts. The lesson is extremely profound. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interview requested that OCT Group Co., Ltd. urge Shenzhen OCT Happy Valley Tourism Company to do its best to treat the injured, cooperate with the accident investigation, learn lessons from the accident, and fully implement the company&#39;s main responsibility for safety. It is necessary to draw inferences from one example and carry out comprehensive hidden danger inspections and rectifications in subordinate amusement parks, effectively strengthen the safety management of special equipment such as large-scale amusement facilities, resolutely prevent major accidents, keep the bottom line of special equipment safety, and ensure the safety of people&#39;s lives and property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant personnel from Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipal Market Supervision Bureau attended the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[他们眼中的吴尊友：“疫”线三载，抗“艾”一生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259691]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/31/7438acad8d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 31/7438acad8d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256289&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, Wu Zunyou’s work did not decrease significantly. Just because of chemotherapy and surgery, the office location was changed from the new site of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Changping, Beijing, to the old office building near the Temple of Heaven. Jia Tianyong/China News Service/Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For most people, they know Wu Zunyou from his repeated appearances at the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic press conference started. Some netizens even put together a group picture of his photogenic scenes - from 2020 to 2022, he gradually lost weight, &quot;like green silk in the morning and snow in the evening.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Many people have much whiter hair than me. I just feel my work experience through media publicity.&quot; At the beginning of 2023, on CCTV News In the interview, he responded, &quot;Many people have paid more than me. They are working on the front line, and some have paid with their lives, so my investment is really nothing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He did pay the price with his life. At 12:56 on October 27, 2023, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and former director of the Center for STD and AIDS Prevention and Control, who had long worked on the front line of public health, died of illness in Beijing at the age of 60. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is less known is that he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two years ago. &quot;When we learned that Teacher Wu was ill, the first thing he said was that he was too tired.&quot; In Guo Wei&#39;s impression, Wu Zunyou rested for less than four hours a day. &quot;We sent him an email at two o&#39;clock in the morning, and at four o&#39;clock I received a reply.&quot; Guo Wei was a student of Wu Zunyou. He later worked at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and became colleagues with Wu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;People who know Wu Zunyou well recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that although Wu was not tall, he was very energetic and always had a slight smile on his lips when he spoke. He usually likes sports, and a pair of running shoes is a frequent item in his luggage. When he travels on business, he always gets up early for a morning run. He also loves badminton. Wu Chang jokes that his right arm is stronger than his left arm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the National Two Sessions in 2023, he also prepared a proposal on strengthening the training of public health talents as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference: &quot;We must train more Experts in the field of public health...should have successors in the field of infectious disease prevention and control, so cultivating talents and having a strong team is very important for the future of China&#39;s public health.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Requirements for makeup &quot;Block the haggard face&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Wei discovered that the teacher had changed. In December 2021, Wu Zunyou was awarded the &quot;Most Beautiful Technology Worker&quot; &quot;——Wu Zunyou on TV is much thinner than before. &quot;I asked him how much you weigh now, and he said it&#39;s only eighty pounds.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the operation, Wu Zunyou recovered well at first. His weight gradually increased from 80 kilograms to 90 kilograms, and his physical strength slowly recovered. However, a review a few months later found that Cancer lesions also appeared in other organs. Pancreatic cancer is known as the &quot;king of cancers&quot;, with a five-year survival rate of less than one-tenth. Wu Zunyou, a medical student, knows very well what kind of disease pancreatic cancer is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, Guo Wei went to Wu Zunyou’s home to pick him up to record a video for World AIDS Day on December 1, and found that his “hair was all white, and his clothes were He&#39;s going to be a whole lot bigger.&quot; When putting on makeup, he specifically asked to &quot;block the haggard face.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;His voice is completely different from before. It has no power at all. During the filming of the video, it took a lot of effort to speak out. He told Guo Wei that he did not dare to take off his clothes casually because he was too weak and he might catch a cold quickly if he took off his clothes. He had to hide away from air conditioners and fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, his work did not decrease significantly. He only changed his office location from the new site of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Changping, Beijing, due to chemotherapy and surgery. An old office building near the Temple of Heaven. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The website of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that on February 27, 2023, Wu Zunyou also attended a high-level expert seminar on the prevention and treatment of AIDS and hepatitis C. His last Weibo Stay at 21:22 on April 2, 2023, and advocate &quot;scientific wearing of masks&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Wei recalled that on May 28, 2023, Wu Zunyou and some relevant leaders and experts met at the Oriental Hotel in Beijing to discuss the methadone maintenance treatment plan. Later Guo Wei realized When I arrived, the Oriental Hotel was near the Friendship Hospital where Wu Zunyou was hospitalized and the old CDC office, making it convenient for him to rush from the hospital to meetings. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Fighting AIDS under pressure&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If the epidemic made the public aware of Wu Zunyou, the public health system knew about Wu Zunyou from AIDS prevention and treatment began. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the autumn of 1994, the plasma of a 41-year-old woman in Anhui was tested positive for HIV. However, she lived in a remote rural area with little contact with the outside world and denied it. There is a history of drug abuse, extramarital sexual relations, etc., which almost cuts off all channels of transmission. When he was at a loss, the Anhui Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention called Wu Zunyou, who was studying for a PhD in epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Wu Zunyou&#39;s research, a new route of AIDS transmission has surfaced - this woman often sells plasma, and 40% of samples from the local plasma bank are HIV positive , and the equipment is not disinfected, leaving a lot of opportunities for infection. His discovery prevented many people from contracting AIDS through apheresis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Zunyou’s research direction as a mentor at UCLA is the prevention and treatment of AIDS. After returning to China after graduating with a Ph.D. in 1995, he joined the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;now the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span>;) and became the then academic director of the Academy of Preventive Medicine. He is a postdoctoral fellow of Zeng Yi, the president and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on behavioral intervention for HIV/AIDS. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;As for the epidemiology of AIDS, many people in China are already doing it, and they are doing it very well. And the prevention of the spread of AIDS for high-risk groups is Almost no one cares about behavioral intervention work.&quot; Wu Zunyou later explained his choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, most of the people at high risk of AIDS were hidden special groups, such as blood sellers, sex workers, drug addicts, etc. Intervention services were provided for special groups. , reducing their risky behaviors was beyond the acceptance of the general public at the time. &quot;I also faced a certain amount of pressure to deal with this difficult bone.&quot; Wu Zunyou once said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On a trip to Yunnan to investigate the spread of AIDS among female sex workers, Wu Zunyou hoped that the local epidemic prevention stationmaster would take them to the &quot;red light district.&quot; Wu Zunyou and his party visited hair salons one by one. &quot;A &#39;lady&#39; from the hair salon slammed the door and left after learning our true purpose.&quot; Later, they found another one and talked for 45 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At a seminar held on the beach in Beihai, Guangxi, Wu Zunyou and the organizers of the meeting gave each of the AIDS prevention and control personnel in each province 50 yuan to spend money Talk to the sex worker on the beach. &quot;They found it incredible that the conference organizers actually wanted to push them into the arms of sex workers. China has never had such training.&quot; Wu Zunyou later recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, these surveys have become the basis for distributing free condoms, promoting the correct use of condoms, providing clinic consultation services, and formulating AIDS intervention methods that are consistent with national conditions. They have also been It has been incorporated into the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations and the Five-Year Action Plan for AIDS Control as a national strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another contribution of Wu Zunyou is the promotion of methadone maintenance therapy among drug addicts to control the AIDS epidemic. &quot;During this period, the health department had to deal with a lot of work with the public security and judicial departments, including national plans, drug collection, policy revision, on-site pilots and experimental work, all carried out by him and a small number of people.&quot; Guo Wei recalled. As of the end of 2015, there were 785 methadone clinics operating across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This approach has been recognized by the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, which has promoted it globally as a model for AIDS prevention and treatment. In 2022, the World Health Organization awarded Wu Zunyou the Mandela Health Promotion Award. The award citation stated: &quot;He is a pioneer in designing, piloting and expanding service promotion programs among sex workers. He established China&#39;s first needle exchange project and the first large-scale opioid substitution treatment program.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10 /31/45bc2dbd3e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/45bc2dbd3e.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;256290&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 1, 2021, an AIDS prevention and treatment propaganda was posted at a bus station in Fengtai District, Beijing advertise.

He often interacts with netizens and responds to requests for help and questions. On June 4, 2014, he said, &quot;Yesterday, a netizen in Fuzhou reported that the first month of AIDS treatment in Fuzhou requires self-pay. Today I arranged for colleagues to contact the local area.&quot; Faced with a netizen&#39;s criticism of AIDS prevention propaganda, he responded modestly: &quot;Your criticism is true. AIDS propaganda and education need to be strengthened and more targeted. Many people will say this, but almost no one knows how to do it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;He and I met at a meeting, and he knew all about Beijing&#39;s AIDS organizations in advance.&quot; Kong Lingkun still remembers the scene when they met more than ten years ago. . Kong Lingkun is the chairman of the Beijing Charity Without Borders Charity Foundation and has been committed to eliminating discrimination and supporting AIDS patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Kong Lingkun’s recollection, in 2015, the Beijing Charity Without Borders Charity Foundation settled in the Fifth Medical Center of the People’s Liberation Army General Hospital and set up a charity clinic. Wu Zunyou even made a special trip to the center Visit social workers and patients, and pay attention to the testing work of key groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For disease control personnel, the better you do your job, the less you can see your results. In clinical terms, the more patients you treat, the less likely they are to see your results. The more we do, the greater the sense of accomplishment. But if you look at us (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;CDC staff&lt;/span>;), when we do a better job, the patients The fewer there are; the fewer patients you have, the less you will be seen by society and invisible (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;invisible&lt;/span>;).&quot; 2022 In 2016, Wu Zunyou said this in an interview with &quot;Chinese Philanthropist&quot; magazine&#39;s Person of the Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It&#39;s hard to say what his greatest contribution is. As long as it talks about all aspects and every field of AIDS in China, he has left a mark.&quot; Now at the United Nations Guo Wei, a strategic information consultant at the UNAIDS Representative Office in China, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the COVID-19 epidemic, Wu Zunyou posted on Weibo more frequently and with more words. Southern Weekend reporters found that since 2022, he has posted 23 original Weibo posts, covering the new crown, monkeypox, influenza epidemics, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The increase in exposure has also led to more controversy. In January 2022, Omicron virus first appeared in China and spread locally. Wu Zunyou said that Omicron virus is &quot;taking all&quot; and the vaccine has a very limited effect in preventing Omicron virus. People can be infected regardless of whether they have been vaccinated or not. . His remarks brought him controversy. On January 30, he apologized on Weibo for &quot;not fully telling the truth&quot;, emphasizing that &quot;although there have been a certain number of breakthrough cases among vaccine recipients, many people have been prevented from getting infected.&quot; Eleven months later, on December 7, he revised his view on Weibo: &quot;The new crown vaccine has a certain effect in preventing infection, and its effect is more significant in reducing the incidence of severe illness and reducing deaths.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Faced with doubts, in an interview with CCTV News in March 2023, he said, &quot;As a professional, sometimes you have to have the courage or courage to make such a decision. , such research and judgment can inform the people of the correct information in a timely manner.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/31/5c6b301bff.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;551&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/5c6b301bff. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In July 2012, Wu Zunyou posted his first Weibo post.

Guo Wei recalled that during his Ph.D. study, he needed to “negate and then deny” all the time - Wu Zunyou asked his students that papers can only be accepted if the conclusion cannot be denied. “Everyone who works with him can feel that he is right.” The job is very demanding.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is related to Wu&#39;s study when he was young. While studying for a doctoral degree in epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), his thesis strived to simplify the complex and find the most effective data in the complex data. He used the simplest method to draw clear conclusions. A conclusion that can withstand scrutiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the eyes of students, Wu is sometimes rigorous to the point of harshness. &quot;Every punctuation point in the documents we sent to Teacher Wu must be considered, and he would never allow flaws to appear.&quot; Guo Wei recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In her acknowledgments for her thesis, Wu Peili, a master&#39;s student at Anhui Medical University, described Wu Zunyou this way: &quot;He always keeps the students&#39; affairs in mind, and never fails to study. He will personally guide you through topic selection, topic development, on-site investigation, data analysis, and article revision, and he will even go as far as to help you change the format of your references.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;This rigor also extends to epidemic prevention and control. Starting in 2020, Wu Zunyou rushed to many places to conduct epidemic investigations. According to statistics from the State Council website, Southern Weekend reporters have attended 25 press conferences since 2020, the last one on February 9, 2023. Wu Zunyou is responsible for the joint prevention and control data team. After 12 o&#39;clock every night, the data from each province are reported and compiled into a report, which is then submitted to Wu Zunyou for review and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2020, during the epidemic in Xinfadi, Beijing, Wu Zunyou led multiple teams to conduct on-site investigations, and Guo Wei also participated. &quot;Which batch of goods and where they are placed, he always finds clues through these particularly small contents. This is the accumulation of long-term epidemiology.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At that time, although Wu Zunyou&#39;s spirit was as good as before, the signs of the disease had begun to appear. He felt stomach pain and often had a bad appetite. It was not until February 2021 that I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Southern Weekend reporters discovered that from January 11 to February 4, 2021, he also went to Suihua City, Heilongjiang Province to carry out work on the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On May 22, 2023, Wu Zunyou came to the office of the United Nations Program on AIDS in China and brought his book &quot;HIV/AIDS in China&quot; ：Beyond the Numbers》. The book concludes by writing that HIV has taught China many lessons over the past 30 years, but as long as it responds to HIV in a pragmatic and flexible manner, works together to limit the number of new infections and improve the well-being of AIDS patients, China will continue to be in a We are well positioned to face the next decade with confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Part of the content refers to the following books:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; &quot;>;&quot;HIV/AIDS in China: Beyond the Numbers&quot; Wu Zunyou/Editor, People&#39;s Medical Publishing House&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;&quot;China&#39;s road to fighting AIDS: Says from those who have experienced it&quot; 》Zhang Wenkang/Author, People&#39;s Medical Publishing House&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
