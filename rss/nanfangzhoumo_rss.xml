(Southern Weekend reporter Du Hansan/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the first batch of independently trained PhDs in New China, 68-year-old Zhu Yong is considered young. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating from high school in 1974, Zhu Yong worked in the garden farm for four years. He originally thought he would deal with fruit trees for the rest of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Three years later, the college entrance examination resumed, and 23-year-old Zhu Yong entered the Department of Political Education of Anhui University to study. Nowadays, this age may have graduated with a bachelor&#39;s degree, but at that time, the eldest classmate in Zhu Yong&#39;s class was already 31 years old, and there were fathers and sons enrolled in other departments at the same time. In his own words, &quot;it was delayed for four years, but not too long.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The prelude of reform and opening up has been played, and the spring tide is surging in the economic field. At the end of 1978, Anhui University changed the 1977 Department of Political Education into the Department of Philosophy and Economics. Zhu Yong wanted to be transferred to the Department of Economics, but failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, he continued to study for a master&#39;s degree in Chinese legal history at Anhui University, and entered China University of Political Science and Law to study for a doctoral degree in Chinese legal history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 1987, the Degree Evaluation Committee of China University of Political Science and Law officially decided to award Zhu Yong a doctorate in law - the degree certificate number is &quot;Bo 87001&quot;. He is He is the first doctor of legal history in New China and the first doctor of law trained by China University of Political Science and Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 12, 2023. On the campus of China University of Political Science and Law, pedestrians walk in a hurry. When I walked into Zhu Yong&#39;s office and saw a whole wall of books, time seemed to slow down again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the interview, he mentioned twice that his experience was relatively dull and he hoped to write in a &quot;low-key&quot; and &quot;plain&quot; style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhu Yong said that a few years ago, he accepted the task of compiling and organizing the &quot;(Newly Edited) General History of China&quot; and the &quot;History of Chinese Legal System&quot;. His current wish is to compile a special history that truly represents the evolution of Chinese law and to gain recognition from both the legal and historical circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I vaguely feel that the direction of society is changing&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1974, you had just graduated from high school at the age of 18 and jumped in line at the Shushan Garden Farm in the suburbs of Hefei. . What kind of work did you do at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mainly working on fruit trees. This includes loosening soil and fertilizing fruit trees, weeding and pruning, spraying pesticides and drainage, picking and caring for fruit trees, etc. Fruit trees are highly seasonal and more tiring than farm work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Eating peaches feels good, but picking peaches in summer is particularly uncomfortable. If you wear too much clothes, you will feel hot; if you wear too little, the peach hairs will feel itchy if they stick to your body. In the peach orchard, the branches are low and the ground is full of ditches and bumps. I can only bend down and carry the baskets of peaches out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, hundreds of young people gather at the garden farm, and they can always find fun. When the fruit is ripe, it needs 24 hours of supervision. If you work the night shift, you won&#39;t be able to sleep for 8 hours at night. Someone came to steal the fruit, and everyone was very excited. They divided their troops to guard and try to catch the person. No one came to steal, but the night felt boring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Waiting in the garden After 4 years, do you have a chance to read a book? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Basically there are no books that we like to read. There are some learning materials that I generally don’t like to read. At that time, those who &quot;criticized Lin Biao and Confucius&quot; called Confucius &quot;the second son of Confucius&quot; and extracted his remarks for criticism. Everyone thinks what Confucius said is quite reasonable, but after listening to expert analysis, they feel that what the experts said is also reasonable. Only then will I be interested in reading it. After reading it, I can show it off by chatting with others. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also a few readings that are circulated privately, and people are eager to get the books. For example, &quot;Three Heroes and Five Righteousness&quot; is about Bao Gong and a group of heroes who travel the world. Too many people have read this book, and dozens of pages are either damaged or rolled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I have thought about myself Any chance of going to college? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I didn’t think about this issue when I jumped in line. At that time, there were also university students from workers, peasants and soldiers, but the number of places was very small. This was almost impossible on our farm. My personality can be summed up in two words: casualness. I feel that since everyone can bear it, then work hard, and you will not be so tired when you enter management in the future, and there is still hope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I didn’t expect it to be that far back then. If there had not been reform and opening up, I would have worked on the farm for the rest of my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When did you start Are you aware of a change in social trends? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At the end of 1976, one day we were working together in the reservoir. The loudspeaker suddenly switched to another channel and played the song &quot;The Waves of Honghu Lake&quot;. Although the noise is extremely loud, the melody is melodious. Hundreds of people put down what they were doing and stood quietly listening. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, many songs before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; could not be played. Everyone thought it was incredible, how could this song be played? I have a vague feeling that the direction of society is changing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was at that time that Xinhua Bookstore began to sell classic novels such as &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, &quot;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Water Margin&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, but there was a queue to buy the books. Very long queue. I have a very good friend among the educated youth, whose family works in Xinhua Bookstore in Hefei City, so I asked her to buy a set. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you know Restore the college entrance examination news? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The summer of 1977 was the season when fruits were ripe, and there was no official announcement yet. The college entrance examination is to be resumed, but some people are already talking about it privately. If it is spread too much, everyone will believe it. In the orchard, the young man works the night shift. After getting off work at four or five in the morning, he takes a nap first and then reviews his books. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have been hesitating for a while, feeling that I have lost so much time studying and I don’t want to take the college entrance examination. My mother was hospitalized in other places at the time, and she asked people to pass on the message through various channels. She said absolutely that if I didn&#39;t take the college entrance examination, she would not come home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the beginning, everyone was not very enthusiastic about reading the book. They just felt that others were reviewing and it would be inappropriate not to review themselves. In October 1977, &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; officially announced the resumption of the college entrance examination, and everyone went all out to change the status quo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are many educated youths on our farm who have signed up to take the college entrance examination. Later, many people asked for leave for various reasons. At first, the farm required that educated youths were not allowed to take leave and were not allowed to read during working hours. But the leaders at all levels of the farm are also relatively simple and kind-hearted. They also have children and understand our urgency for the college entrance examination, so they still have a certain degree of laxity in management. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Going to the Department of Philosophy for my undergraduate degree&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern China Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Professor Mo Lifeng from the School of Liberal Arts of Nanjing University has a similar experience to yours. They both joined the team in Anhui and were both admitted. Anhui University, where he later became the first doctor of literature. He once said that he was very ambitious before going to the countryside. He applied for Tsinghua University in his first three choices, but after staying in the countryside for 10 years, he only dared to apply for Anhui University. What impact do you think the four years of queue jumping had on you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I applied for a volunteer, my vision was not broad enough and I did not think of going to another province to go to school. I applied for liberal arts. I felt that Anhui University was the best school within my knowledge, so I applied. Later I learned that with my scores, I could only get into Anhui University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 1977 College Entrance Examination in Anhui Province was held from December 10th to 11th. Shortly after the Spring Festival, I received the admission notice from Anhui University. Although I will report to the university soon, after the Spring Festival holiday, I still went back to work in the second farm team, thinking that I should stand on the last shift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, our second brigade had a walking tractor that collected feces from public toilets every day and fertilized the fruit trees. The body behind the tractor was broken, and the brigade secretary asked me to send it to a repair shop for repairs. It was so cold that the remaining feces on the truck bed was frozen. Before repairing, it had to be thawed with hot water and then wiped clean. At this time, I thought, I will leave the farm next week anyway, report to the university, and let this matter go. After that, I started my academic career of reading and teaching. However, my failure to get the tractor body repaired has long been a problem of mine. Later, I went back to the farm to visit the old secretary of the brigade, and I apologized to him specifically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am lucky. Shushan Garden Farm, as my first foothold into society, allowed me to plan my life based on the principles of positivity and contentment, and to get along with others with a kind and optimistic attitude, which benefited me a lot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After arriving at Anhui University , why choose the Department of Philosophy? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I applied for my application, I applied for the Department of Political Education of Anhui University. Around the end of 1978, the school adjusted its majors and changed our ’77 students in the Department of Political Education into philosophy and economics respectively. At that time, the prelude to the country&#39;s reform and opening up had begun, and the economic field was booming. Most of the students hope to enter the Department of Economics, and I also want to adjust to the Department of Economics. But maybe it was because I did not do well in mathematics in the college entrance examination that I entered the philosophy department. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; How is everyone&#39;s enthusiasm for studying? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Everyone really valued their time at that time. There is a big age gap between the classmates in our class. The oldest was born in 1947 and the youngest was born in 1962. There is a 15-year age difference. In other departments, there are fathers and children admitted at the same time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The lights in the dormitory are turned off at 11 o&#39;clock in the evening, and many students go to read under the street lamps. At &lt;span>;four or five&lt;/span>; o&#39;clock in the morning, the street lights went out and the canteen lights came on. There is always a row of classmates holding books outside the cafeteria window. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2000, Zhu Yong (middle), his master&#39;s tutor Chen Shengqing (first from left), and doctoral tutor Zhang Jinfan (first from right) attended an academic conference at Anhui University.

At that time, the school distributed work uniformly, and they were all good units. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the early 1980s, the construction of the national legal system was initially launched. Everyone thinks that the legal system is an effective means of national governance, but no one can clearly explain the &quot;legal system&quot;. The more this happens, the more expectations they have for the legal system, and they believe that legal talents have great development prospects. My parents didn’t understand what legal history was, but they knew that I majored in law, so they fully supported my application for a master’s degree in Chinese legal history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was in my third year of master&#39;s degree, I learned that Professor Zhang Jinfan of China University of Political Science and Law was recruiting doctoral students in Chinese legal history, so I decided to sign up for the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Cooking noodles and talking about academics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern China Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In February 1985, you went to China University of Political Science and Law to study for a PhD in Chinese legal history. What was your first impression of this school? What is it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first impression is the legal awareness of Fa Da people. When I first came here, the Third Ring Road was being built near the north gate of the school. Once while taking a bus, I saw a law student having a dispute with the driver over the parking issue of the bus. The driver thinks it&#39;s almost enough, don&#39;t take it seriously. But students said the driver did not follow the rules. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After experiencing the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, people at that time generally had little sense of rules. The awareness of rules among law students is refreshing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are Chinese political and legal Did the first batch of PhD students recruited by the university receive &quot;special preferential treatment&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The school gave me and my fellow seniors Zheng Qin and Huai Xiaofeng a scholarship. We bought a tape recorder and let us learn foreign languages. At that time, cassette recorders were very expensive, costing more than 400 yuan each. The second batch of doctoral students will not be issued. The management attaches great importance to us, but they use too much force. Maybe they don’t know what kind of learning conditions they should provide to doctoral students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The language I study is English. The school thinks that a doctorate is a higher level than a master&#39;s degree. It is not appropriate to take classes with master&#39;s students, and it is difficult to be alone. Give us foreign language classes. So I was asked to attend a training class in Changchun to learn foreign languages, and the expenses were reimbursed. Training courses are very expensive, with foreign teachers attending classes and students staying in hotels. When you return to school, you don’t need to take another exam. A training certificate will count as passing the foreign language course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The 1980s , the doctoral training system is still in the exploratory stage. You are Mr. Zhang Jinfan’s “open disciple”. How did he guide the doctor? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, China University of Political Science and Law’s curriculum, teaching methods, and class hours for doctoral students There are no clear regulations on requirements, staged assessments, etc. The entire training process is basically the responsibility of the instructor himself. It is somewhat similar to the master-apprenticeship system in traditional Chinese society where a master leads an apprentice. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When we were studying, Mr. Zhang was the vice president and dean of the graduate school. His schedule was very full, but lunch time was fixed. We proposed that we let him come to our dormitory at noon on weekdays, use an electric cup to cook a cup of noodles for him, beat an egg, and teach him while eating. The four masters and apprentices closed the door, whispered, cooked noodles, and talked about academics, having fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although I majored in legal history for my master&#39;s degree, I did not receive systematic legal training during my undergraduate period, and the basic theories of law are relatively lacking. Mr. Zhang taught students in accordance with their aptitude and believed that I should pay attention to the construction of the legal knowledge system and allowed me to audit civil law, criminal law, procedural law and other courses for master students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, everyone from our tutors to the graduate school encouraged us to take full advantage of the concentration of academic talents in Beijing. We went to Peking University, Renmin University, Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and other institutions to take courses, participate in discussions, and visit famous teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zhu Yong&#39;s doctorate certificate, number is &quot;Bo 87001&quot;.

The key is to find first-hand information, and it will be easy to produce results. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While studying for a master&#39;s degree at Anhui University, the school gave the master&#39;s degree a thesis investigation fee of 300 yuan. It took me almost two months to travel to more than a dozen provinces. My main task was to check the family laws and regulations recorded in the genealogies of various places. At that time, in the southern provinces, genealogies were managed not primarily as books but as cultural relics. Therefore, genealogies are mostly stored in museums. Most of the genealogies from various places have been in existence for 100 to 300 years. The paper is yellowed and covered with insect holes. You have to read it carefully, and it will break easily if you are not careful. None of this raw material has been used before. In two months, I hand-copied thousands of cards about family laws and clan rules in museums in more than a dozen provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was studying for my Ph.D., I spent a lot of time consulting in the ancient book library of the Beijing Library located in the Imperial College and the First Historical Archives of China located in the Xihua Gate of the Forbidden City. material. At that time, various academic institutions were very friendly to students looking for information. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Talk about academics&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before 1980, three international seminars on the history of Chinese legal system were held in the world, but mainland China was not invited in any of them. Scholars participate. What do you think about this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Once Mr. Zhang gave us a lecture and mentioned the Chinese legal system of scholars from other countries His historical academic achievements exceed those of local Chinese scholars, and even international academic seminars on related topics have not even been attended by Chinese scholars. From the perspective of academic responsibility, Mr. Wang hopes that we will work hard to change the status quo and firmly place the center of Chinese legal history research in China&#39;s local academic community. We were deeply touched by the words of Mr. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; There is a voice that believes that compared with departmental law, legal history has less say in reality. However, some scholars believe that true history must contribute to reality and history must participate in the social process. What are your thoughts? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Concerning historical research, diversity in purposes and methods should be allowed. You can focus on connecting with reality, or you can focus on academics themselves. I have seen that some doctoral students always think about how to directly guide reality when deciding on a thesis topic. I encourage students’ innovation, but I also tell them that a scholar’s ​​task is to do academic work first and clarify academic issues. The formulation and implementation of ancient laws had specific background conditions in ancient society. The connection with reality must be appropriate and logical, and cannot be too far-fetched. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have a similar experience myself. When a publication requests a manuscript, I send it in, and the editor sends back expert review comments. Experts suggested that I should base my article on the views I proposed and make some connections with contemporary social reality. I replied to the editor and said that my interest lies in talking about academics and history. The editor was very understanding and accepted my comments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Scholars may be able to distinguish There are two types of people, one is doing pure learning in an ivory tower, and the other is caring about reality. Should you be the former? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the value of a scholar lies in the academic itself. My research is generally not directly related to connected with reality. We can sort out the development process of legal systems and legal theories in Chinese history in detail, and put forward our own opinions on their laws, characteristics, and functions. If we can reproduce their true state and show their true role in the process of national management and social governance, our academic goal will be accomplished. As for whether this research result can play a role in contemporary national governance and rule of law construction, I believe readers are smart enough to sort through it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Research in the humanities is often related to scholars’ real-life encounters and life experiences, and is very personal. What impact do you think your past experiences have had on your scientific research work? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My personality is conservative and lacks pioneering. Even if they join the queue for 4 years, the material conditions are poor and the labor intensity is high. But during those 4 years, there were no unpleasant feelings. In current terms, I am basically satisfied with the status quo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From 1977 to 1987, I studied continuously for 10 years and experienced three options: undergraduate, master&#39;s and doctoral examinations. These three road choices were not too difficult. If it was too difficult, you might have backed down at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Self-evaluation, my academic research is not very critical and not creative enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;From &quot;master-apprentice system&quot; to &quot;teacher-student system&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How has the current graduate education changed compared to the era when you were studying? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When we were studying, it was a more typical &quot;master-apprentice system&quot;. It is similar to the way a master leads an apprentice in a traditional social handicraft workshop. It is characterized by personalized guidance and comprehensive training. Mr. Zhang can give us personalized guidance and comprehensive training according to his own positioning and expectations for young scholars. The content of guidance varies from person to person and students are taught in accordance with their aptitude. At the same time, we pay attention to comprehensive training. Mr. Xiang gives us detailed guidance in all aspects of academic research, including reading lists, thesis topic selection, data screening, condensation of ideas, thesis structure, and written expression. It also covers many aspects of social interaction and dealing with people outside of academia. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;master-apprentice&quot; training method is more conducive to teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, but it cannot solve the problem of large-scale education. After the expansion of postgraduate enrollment, the &quot;teacher-student system&quot; in which teachers lead students was gradually developed and improved. Its characteristic is that it pays more attention to standardized training and digital management in the education process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;With Mr. Zhang You have similar experiences. Since 2001, you have served as the vice president and dean of the graduate school of China University of Political Science and Law for nearly 14 years.

For example, whether they are doctoral students or master&#39;s students, during the six-semester training process, there are unified regulations in the training plan on which books students should read, which classes they should listen to, and which teaching links they must complete. How many credits should a doctoral student complete, how many courses should be taken, how many reading reports, term papers, and academic papers should be submitted, how many days of social practice should be carried out, how many academic papers should be formally published in journals of what level, and the number of dissertations should reach tens of thousands. Words, etc., all have clear numerical regulations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The advantage of standardized training and digital management is that the training results can be evaluated and the training process can be monitored, especially those that can effectively adapt to the large-scale education of graduate students.

More than one doctoral student. In the training process of doctoral students, some &quot;master-apprenticeship&quot; habits are retained to a certain extent. The students I recruit have undergraduate and master&#39;s degree education backgrounds in law, history, and Chinese. To train them, in addition to completing quantitative prescribed actions, it is necessary to make up for the missing knowledge structure. Some students have good reading and research abilities, but lack social interaction. For these students, their shortcomings also need to be addressed in a targeted manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Today&#39;s students are very anxious, introverted, and worried about finding an ideal job.

Personal career development requires both good self-quality and suitable external opportunities. There is no need to say more about the cultivation and improvement of self-quality. How to face external opportunities, based on my own experience and understanding of life, I have given advice to my students: be proactive and be content with the situation. When planning your career blueprint, if you face multiple opportunities, you should be proactive, design the best plan, and strive for the best choice. When there are few opportunities to choose and it is very difficult to change the status quo, you should cherish the present and take things as they come. In different positions, if you do your job well, you can also show your talents and achieve success. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[预防糖尿病，摆脱“甜蜜负担”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260553]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Today is the annual &quot;World Diabetes Day&quot;.

There is a word &quot;bitter summer&quot; in Japanese that specifically describes the scorching summer heat. Even if you cannot fully understand its original meaning, the single Chinese word &quot;bitter&quot; can already convey the meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/WsZh4SZI60RS60TPLMVRINpXpRxZuFCDHCT7edrx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/WsZh4SZI60RS60TPLMVRINpXpRxZuFCDHCT7edrx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258160&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the Tokyo Imperial Palace running route, there are facilities designed to cool down runners. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time I came to Japan was in 2019. If the epidemic has changed anything, I hate it the most. Runners have started running, and running on the streets of Tokyo is itself a mark of the epidemic. At the height of the epidemic, all sports venues in Beijing were closed. I couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore, so I ordered my first pair of running shoes online and started running along the empty streets. From barely finishing 3 kilometers, to the joy of running 5 kilometers for the first time, to completing 10 kilometers and half marathon, although it may not be worth mentioning among the huge running community, it is a small achievement for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Running also gives me a new perspective on a place. Familiar places have new experiences because of running. In turn, this sense of strangeness also makes every small &quot;tribulation&quot; more enjoyable. Easier to get through. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/2ZPsf6DyySDGykcwiy80TWWk3Yxmn3x8xHSMee12.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/2ZPsf6DyySDGykcwiy80TWWk3Yxmn3x8xHSMee12.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258158&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Scenery of the Imperial Palace Running Route&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been to Tokyo a lot times, but I did my homework before coming this time and learned that the running route around the Imperial Palace is the most famous; the writer Haruki Murakami prefers to practice around the Meiji Shrine outer garden. He wrote in &quot;What do I talk about when I talk about running&quot; &quot;Specially mentioned in the book; if you want to run at a higher pace, or complete interval running exercises &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (a high-intensity and low-intensity Cross-intensity running exercises can help improve runners&#39; ability to resist lactic acid)&lt;/span>;, you can go to the Yoyogi Park track and field to try your skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While doing my homework, I also learned that Tokyo has complete supporting facilities for runners. Near the most popular route around the Imperial Palace, there are several hotels where runners can store bags, bathe, and change clothes. The service station only charges a fee equivalent to 30 to 40 yuan, and you can also rent sportswear, running shoes, running pockets and other equipment. You have decided to experience it before setting off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来到东京第二天便特意起了个大早，坐地铁前往事先查到的一家跑者服务站。这家服务站和餐厅开在一起，由于收费不高，跑者服务站通常采用混业经营的方式，让跑步的人留下来吃个早餐，或者把服务站直接开在著名运动品牌的店铺里，增加客源，拉动销售，都是多年运营后，服务站经营者想出来的办法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这家服务站装饰朴素，却有着日本式的干净实用。前台的姑娘不善英语，手边也没有任何英语说明，看得出这里的客人以日本当地人为主，很少接待游客。比比划划，来意并不难懂，我付了钱，领了钥匙和毛巾，剩下的就完全自助了。后来我去的另一家服务站装潢明显高档一些，两家收费差不多，而且都能办月卡，月卡价格基本是三次单买的价格，非常划算。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二家服务站还和运动品牌合作，有一墙不同鞋码的美津浓跑鞋，一墙Salomon竞速路跑鞋。美津浓的跑鞋可以免费使用，Salomon的那款鞋价格较高，国内售价要2000元，也只需象征性交100日元&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（约5元人民币）&lt;/span>;便可试用。因为体验上佳，我差点因为100日元的试用动了自己买一双的念头，看来这种试用的确是一种高明的销售手段，而且销售场景非常精准。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;只有亲自体验一下这条线，才知道为什么它是东京跑步线路第一名。其实也是无奈之举。作为人口稠密、寸土寸金的国际都市，东京核心区的跑步条件实在有限，路网密集导致红绿灯很多，街道狭窄就连绿化也做得相当克制，很难见到成排的大树。所以皇居周边的护城河及茂密植被，以及环城一周没有间断的五公里“跑道”，则成为热爱跑步的东京人不二之选。环皇居线还有相对起伏不大、公共交通便利的优势。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;沿着作家的道路跑着，却没有灵感迸发。作家也很诚实，说跑步的时候大多是胡思乱想，甚至把自己当成一个没有感情的跑步机器就好了。世界上知名作家很多，坚韧的跑者更不少，但兼而有之且为大众熟悉的，似乎只有村上春树。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;日本出了这么一位热爱跑步的知名作家其来有自。长跑在日本属于国民性的运动，上百年对长跑的推广和发展，让日本的跑者覆盖各个年龄层次，基数大、水平高，可以类比中国的乒乓球或者美国的篮球。世界六大马拉松赛中，东京马拉松被称为“民补”多过“官补”的赛事，人们自发为参赛选手提供沿途免费补给，数量竟然比赛事承办方准备的补给站还多。东京人的热情也与本土选手超强的实力有关，经常能有数名本土选手跑进2小时10分的大关，这一成绩与世界顶尖的东非运动员不分高下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马拉松赛事在国内近十年的发展也是如火如荼，如果经常阅览赛事报名app，每个月都能找到参赛的地方，有时候只恨分身乏术。如果说国内马拉松赛事和世界“六大”有什么差距的话，其实更多是文化层面的，而形成文化别无他途，唯有时间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据美国日本学家托马斯·黑文斯（Thomas Havens）追溯，1912年日本派出两名选手参加瑞典斯德哥尔摩奥运会马拉松项目，可被称为马拉松运动在日本的起点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时的日本政府财力有限，只能选派两名运动员参加奥运会。马拉松这个项目与江户时代末期零星举办的长距离赛跑活动十分相似，这些赛事的目的是“提高全民的身体素质”，并且表明日本人可以在西方的类似比赛中获得自己的地位。这种融合了国家自豪感、现代化证明与积极参与国际竞争态度的驱动力，正是同期明治维新的遗产。一个著名的例子是，1901年在东京不忍池周围的狭窄赛道上，举行了一场热闹的12小时跑步耐力赛，吸引了一百多名参赛者，其中15人完成了71圈&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（103.6公里）&lt;/span>;。所以，最后参加1912年奥运会的两名日本选手中，就有一名是马拉松运动员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早在1920至1930年代，日本人已经跻身于世界最快马拉松成绩缔造者之列。二战以后，经过几十年的休养生息，1960至1980年代，日本马拉松运动员在世界上回到了统治级地位，1966年世界排行榜的前17强成绩，有15个是日本男子选手创造的。到了1990年代，日本女子马拉松运动员开始在比赛中拔得头筹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/eGqKlFUPUY3mB92p0O1ho9fWKjEsLzTttbo2qd38.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;2018年，小说《强风吹拂》的同名电视剧在日本上映，这个以箱根驿传为背景，讲述一支杂牌大学长跑队通过魔鬼训练，在比赛中逆袭的热血体育故事，让更多人认识了这场日本体育盛事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;箱根驿传的创办者正是前面提到的，日本派出参加斯德哥尔摩奥运会的马拉松选手之一金栗四三。金栗四三的第一次马拉松奥运之旅可谓惨痛，当时日本以全国之力把他和另一名短跑运动员送到奥运会赛场上，两名运动员每人的旅费相当于名校早稻田大学三十六年的学费。但全国人民的期待和舟车劳顿把他压垮了，比赛当天酷热异常，甚至有一名葡萄牙运动员倒地身亡，而金栗四三在途中也失去意识，被当地农户抬回家中，醒来已是第二天比赛结束后。他后来还参加过两次奥运会，最好成绩是第16名。现在往回看，这三十六年名牌大学学费成本的回报过于丰厚，金栗四三成了日本马拉松发展的领路人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1920年，第一届箱根驿传在早稻田大学、明治大学等四所高校间展开，除去两次世界大战时停办，至今已举办99届，2024年将是这项比赛的百年盛事。箱根驿传为日本马拉松运动提供了大量的世界级运动员，其中中国跑步爱好者最熟悉的大迫杰，因外貌俊秀、跑姿优雅，俘获了大批粉丝，他就曾是箱根驿传中早稻田大学的精英跑手，至今仍是日本国内马拉松记录保持者。现役的大学生跑者很多是家喻户晓的明星，人们像追星一样搭乘火车提前奔赴观赛点，在新年的寒风中等待数个小时，终点更是会有上万名观众守候，“恭喜”、“辛苦了”、“你已经很棒了”，随着选手一个个通过终点，这样的呐喊声此起彼伏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;只要对马拉松的成绩稍有概念，浏览每年箱根驿传分段成绩简直令人咋舌，尤其2023年，多个赛段尘封已久的纪录被打破。有人在“知乎”上提问，如果在中国选出最优秀的十名业余长跑选手组队，而且不局限于大学生，能不能进箱根驿传的前十，答案令人遗憾，经过同等距离换算后，这支队伍只能获得同年箱根驿传的第15名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后引用一个数据，2012年11月23至25日，全日本一共举办了六场全程马拉松比赛，一共有77772名选手完成比赛，六场中的五场完赛率超过90%。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;长距离跑步比赛枯燥而艰苦，1990年代在国内中长跑项目上引领一时的“马家军”，吸纳的队员大都来自中小城市普通家庭，依靠拼搏努力、能吃苦，通过运动成绩在社会上赢得一席之地。但马拉松在日本一开始就是精英运动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;箱根驿传首先在包括早稻田大学等四所名校间展开，作为民族崛起、国家主义的一部分，这些精英大学生成为当仁不让的主力。这种基因贯穿了日本马拉松近一百年的发展，至今日本的名牌大学仍在为马拉松运动源源不断地输送着年轻力量，这些大学生毕业后通常会进入日本知名企业，加入由企业赞助的专业跑团，代表企业参加国内外各种赛事，为企业争光。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前面提到的大迫杰从早稻田大学毕业后，就加入了日清实业跑团。但加入企业跑团意味着一切以企业利益至上，企业甚至会要求运动员牺牲奥运会等国际大赛的备赛时间，以日本国内赛事优先。所以包括大迫杰在内的很多顶尖选手为了主导自己的运动生涯，最终选择从企业跑团退出。大迫杰退出日清实业，加入由耐克赞助的俄勒冈计划后，日本社会上还有很多呼其“叛徒”的声音，但随着他在国际赛场上获得一次次极为优秀的战绩，这些批评已经成为了过去式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谈到日本马拉松运动从国家主导到市场主导的过程，躲不开一个人——日本前首相中曾根康弘。无论对中国还是日本，中曾根康弘都是极富争议的人物，他曾以军官身份参与过侵华战争，但在中国改革开放初期，又极力促成日本给当时的中国出口贸易提供金融担保，没有日本的担保，以当时中国的经济状况获得国际贷款融资更会难上加难。他曾参观靖国神社，后来又为日本侵华战争道歉。但如果深挖其人物内核，会发现这都源自于他的实用主义。他曾说：“当被问及你在战后民主主义中做了什么，我可以回答，我拼命地努力开发了符合大众民主主义时代的政治手段，其秘籍的专利属于我。”作为迎合民意的高手，他在首相任期内完成了日本“国铁分割国有化”，把曾属于日本国家垄断企业的日本国铁拆了，以公司化的方式运营，现在去日本旅行常看到的“JR东日本”、“JR西日本”、“JR北海道”等等，都是日本国铁拆分出来的公司。按照中曾根康弘的实用主义，这些都是他迎合民意的一部分，正如他所说，当时的日本已经处于一个大众民主主义时代，而他推动了这一切更快发生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这场私有化大潮中，本来属于日本国家主导的运动事业也逐渐交给了市场。 1970年代，曾经认为商业会腐蚀体育精神的日本业余体育协会（JASA），开始允许奥运会选手出现在电视广告中，收到的费用由运动员所在企业和JASA分成。广告巨头电通公司1979年组织了一场“日本出发”活动，以支持次年的莫斯科奥运会。这种大企业赞助体育赛事的行为在1980年代更为流行，运动员的收入也水涨船高。 1991年日本房地产泡沫破裂后，政府财政进一步吃紧，体育事业的市场化被加快，为此日本政府还制定了一系列的税收奖励政策。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这一系列的历史背景下，马拉松运动从1912年日本寄望于在世界产生影响的体育项目，经过一百年的发展，逐渐完成了商业化。这也是世界体育发展的潮流和趋势：通过商业的方式，吸引全民的兴趣和社会资本，在群众运动基础上选拔顶尖人才。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2007年，东京都政府战胜了马拉松精英赛事的既得利益者商业财团，也抚平了东京警察局对马拉松会极大扰乱都市秩序的担忧，由政府出资举办了首届东京马拉松比赛。现在，东京马拉松比赛已经是世界六大国际马拉松赛事之一，要知道“六大”之一的波士顿马拉松始于1897年。东京马拉松为城市带来了巨大影响力和商业收益&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（每年超过1.5亿美元）&lt;/span>;，成为日本各地政府争相模仿的对象，大阪马拉松、神户马拉松、横滨马拉松、北海道马拉松，如今都已成为国内外参与者众多、每次都需要抽签才能报名的赛事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/fiLBn71yrJJIKEVF2OVbgeeWHlXkdpxRdCc4gfza.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;622&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/fiLBn71yrJJIKEVF2OVbgeeWHlXkdpxRdCc4gfza.jpg&quot;

Suffering is optional）。他说，“真正有价值的东西，往往通过效率甚低的营生方能获得。即便这是虚妄的行为，也绝不是愚蠢的行为。我如此认为，作为切实的感受作为经验法则。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，每一位喜爱跑步的人，都可以参考村上春树为自己设计的墓志铭：“他至少是跑到了最后。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[FF三季度卖车3辆，收入55.1万美元]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260579]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;11月14日，Faraday Futere（FF）发布了2023年第三季度财报。报告期内，FF实现了公司历史上的首次创收，营收总额约55.1万美元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;财报称，FF的汽车销售收入包括新车交付相关收入，以及特定的其他功能和服务收入，包括家庭充电器、充电器安装、全天候路边援助、软件更新（“OTA”）、互联网连接和目的地费用（被某些共创费用抵消）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三季度，FF共交付3辆汽车。这意味着每辆车带来的收入约为18.36万美元。而此前FF披露的FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance售价约为30.9万美元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过对FF而言，开始有营收已经是一个新的里程碑了。财报披露，截至财报发布，FF已经交付7辆FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance给新用户。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了营收外，FF三季度的销售成本为1610万美元。其中，1040万美元是工具和设备折旧，剩余的大部分是制造间接费用，其次是劳动力和材料成本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;FF解释称，较高的销售成本是因为早期车辆生产的自然低效——即初始制造低效率和低产量导致的零部件成本较高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，三季度FF仍然处于亏损状态，净亏损约7800万美元，这较去年同期的净亏损1.19亿美元有所收窄。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现金流方面，今年前三季度，FF经营活动产生现金净流出2.4亿美元，去年同期为3.55亿美元；资本支出为1080万美元，去年同期为1.12亿美元；融资活动产生现金净流入为2.376 亿美元，去年同期融资活动的净现金流出为4090万美元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中三季度，FF通过可转换票据、股权信贷额度（ELOC）和ATM融资一共融得6180万美元。截至2023年9月30日，FF的现金余额为856.7万美元，其中包括185.3万美元的限制性现金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于未来，FF表示，公司计划在2024年第一季度末开始第三阶段交付，即向用户全面交付车辆。而根据目前的工厂改善和爬坡计划，FF明年的目标是实现约1000辆汽车的产量，但FF也坦言，这受制于获得所需资本、供应链的能力和稳定性以及取得必要的许可。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[丢下铁饭碗，出走围城丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260559]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;November 11, 2023, Kunming, as the national examination and postgraduate entrance examination are approaching, candidates have a weekend Come to Yunnan Provincial Library for review.

One works in a community in Beijing, with a monthly salary of more than 8,000 yuan, and has a Beijing household registration; the other stayed in Shandong and went to the CPPCC unit, which is also within the system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a former student from Shandong, in the first twenty years of my life, there was a saying that was repeatedly emphasized in my family, &quot;Knowledge changes destiny.&quot; How to understand? I think if there are simulation games for raising children, then my parents’ goal must be for their children to enter a good university and then choose one of the two good jobs of teachers and civil servants. Unfortunately, reality is biased. When he learned that I was not admitted to a major such as administration in the college entrance examination, my dad clearly expressed his disappointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For a long time, the pursuit of the system and the iron rice bowl has been one of the labels for us Shandong people. Until recent years, young people across the country have People also spontaneously fall in love with taking public exams and taking exams for editors. Stability is the most mentioned advantage of this job. The pseudonym in the report is Meng Cheng, a 35-year-old returnee man who joined the editor and then resigned to study for a PhD. This is how he was attracted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The starting point of the story is as usual. He was worried that the employment environment would require more and more academic qualifications. Between studying for a Ph.D. and finding a job, Meng Cheng chose the latter and went smoothly. Obtained a career establishment in a poor county in Guangxi. Unfortunately, this job that I started with great expectations was described as a &quot;siege&quot; when I left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department wrote in the post, it was called Tourism Development Center. I was quite happy and thought I could participate in tourism projects.&quot; On the day of joining the job, Meng Cheng learned that &quot;separation of staff and staff&quot; was implemented in talent introduction, and he was actually assigned to the general office. &quot;Because when you are recruited, you must be assigned an establishment, so the Organization Department collected some empty establishments from the units.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the general office, one of Meng Cheng’s most feared tasks is organizing documents. “For example, if the municipal level publishes a document on the tourism market rectification plan, we will If you want to produce a county-level document, you can copy part of the city-level document, but you can&#39;t copy it all. You have to read it carefully.&quot; From writing to finalizing, it is common to spend a day and a half digging for a few words. What troubles him even more is that for things like writing documents, there is no clear operational process. “A lot of times it’s just casual remarks from the leader.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is still a lot of suffering in the besieged city. During the interview, we met a girl who had been working in the system for five years through talent introduction. The idea of ​​resigning had been lingering in her mind for more than three years, although she did not appear in the manuscript in the end. But I think her summary of the reasons for her resignation should be able to represent the voice of the vast majority of people who want to leave the system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Recent master&#39;s degree graduates should be graded as a fourth-level chief clerk, but my unit assigned me a first-grade chief clerk until now. Join me in introducing Most of the students who came here were appointed as fourth-level chief clerks, and this year they were promoted to third-level chief clerks, which made me feel very unbalanced. On the other hand, the work in the system is more service-oriented and coordination-oriented, and the professional basics There is no use, no sense of gain, and no creativity. Just listen to your superiors and just be an obedient person. Over time, you will no longer be able to think independently. In addition, there is a serious age gap among employees, and the phenomenon of seniority is serious, and hard work is difficult. In the past two years, senior comrades have been considered first for promotions, and most of the energy has been spent on how to push out the work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent times, I have seen my close friends around me I couldn’t find a job everywhere, and I did a lot of job-related topics. I have been thinking that since childhood, the education we have received has cultivated individuals to become intellectually rich through a simple stimulus-reward mechanism. , but rarely teaches us how to grow into a complete self, and what to do next when the school education a person can receive comes to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, at the point of graduating from undergraduate or graduate school, some people throw themselves into society hastily, doing jobs they don’t understand or even dislike. Not getting affirmation, they repeatedly question their personal value; others turn around and hide in school, delaying the time to make a decision. These are all detours taken by talents who are introduced to the county and then leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Meng Cheng&#39;s view, leaving the system means leaving the siege, but is there a siege outside the siege? When can the layers of walls be demolished? Losing money may be a more complex social issue than personal choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孩子被欺负，该打回去吗？谈谈我对孩子的勇气教育]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260544]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;My son, who is in fifth grade, got into a fight at school. When my wife told me, my first reaction was surprise. My son has been mild-mannered since he was a child, not competitive, and rarely conflicts with other children. Before the fifth grade, he had never had a fight. The most he had was an argument and a few angry words. My wife and I occasionally worry: We have been competitive for half our lives, and our children will not be bullied if they have such a bad temper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a naughty little boy in the class who loves to tease others. He is strong and full of energy, and other students cannot stop him. My son occasionally complains: This classmate is very annoying and always teases him and touches him. At first we couldn&#39;t hear the big problem, so we didn&#39;t take it seriously. It is normal for boys to collide with each other. If there is no fight or trouble, we as parents will not interfere deeply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My son complained several times. One day, my wife and I told him: &quot;If the teacher can&#39;t control things, you can solve them yourself. If it doesn&#39;t work, just call him back and don&#39;t let others bully you.&quot; The complaints stopped for a few days, and we almost forgot about this little incident. Unexpectedly, my son actually got into a fight. This was the first real fight between him and his classmates since he went to school, and he was the one who started the fight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cause of the incident is very simple: a group of boys were playing in the dormitory, and the usually naughty boy was teased by a certain child and became irritated. The son was also present, and the boy threw an unknown anger at him, swearing and pushing him. The son angrily demanded an apology, but the other classmate refused, so the son punched the classmate in the face, and the two struggled, and then the teacher arrived and took the two away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We told him that if someone scolds you, just scold him back. How can you hit someone? My son’s answer was that he used to scold him, but that classmate was even better at scolding him. He scolded him again and again, and he was caught twice by the teacher. Not only was he scolded, but he was also made to stand in the classroom. It was so frustrating. &quot;What are you scolding each other?&quot; &quot;He called me stupid, and I called him stupid.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remembering it, the teacher did mention this matter, but he just downplayed it, and we didn&#39;t take it too seriously. pay attention to. When we reminded our son at that time, my wife and I secretly complained: The day has come when the child curses. It seems like this has been going on for two or three months. After a long period of patience and protest, the son finally broke out and rushed towards the strong classmate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After talking to our children, my wife and I were filled with shame and fear. We communicate a lot with our children. In order to give our children room to grow, we don’t pay attention to certain small snippets we hear, and ignore the children’s repeated calls for help. His character was originally gentle, but he endured restraint for a long time, leaving a &quot;weak&quot; impression on his classmates (who took it out on him when they were angered), and he was on the verge of being &quot;bullied&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, the son launched a timely counterattack and prevented the situation from getting worse. This incident also surprised the classmates around him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For his first fight, my wife and I did not blame him, but fell into self-reflection. Reflect on the negligence of parents and the key points of educating children. But one thing is very lucky: we always encourage him to have the courage to have conflicts with classmates, not to be submissive, timid, and have to compromise, but to dare to express anger. It can be seen that this kind of teaching has worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We teach him this way largely because his character is too gentle and needs some &quot;blessing&quot;. A little boy can have no temper, but he must have strength. In order to protect our own rights and dignity, we do not object to children fighting among themselves. It is wrong to actively bully others. Hitting back when bullied is a form of defense and can also establish an effective deterrent. The child asked that time, what should I do if I can’t beat him? Wife&#39;s quick answer: If you can&#39;t beat him, you have to beat him, at least to make him think that you are not easy to mess with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through this incident, we revised a combat &quot;guideline&quot; for children: in the future, if a classmate uses swear words, laughs at you, or insults you, do not use swear words against him. Ask the other person to stop and apologize. If the other person repeatedly refuses to apologize, you can teach him a lesson. It doesn&#39;t matter if you can&#39;t win. If the teacher criticizes you, your parents will bear with you. Don&#39;t get into dirty talk with classmates, it&#39;s too ugly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There must be many people who disagree with this educational concept. Chinese people have always been gentle, courteous, thrifty and accommodating in their interactions. The rules and legal regulations for adults also say that &quot;a gentleman talks but does not use his hands&quot; and &quot;the one who strikes first is at fault.&quot; I don’t need to teach you these principles. Children will gradually understand them as they grow up. We value the education of courage, a quality that is more important than daily academic performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Courage is valuable because it allows children to build daily self-confidence and have the courage to explore and discover; it allows children to get rid of troubles, get rid of worries, and develop a sunny and cheerful personality. When children are in adversity, they can still think and make decisions instead of running away from difficulties, which is conducive to developing the quality of distinguishing right from wrong. It is no accident that a person with courage is often smart and upright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Courage education is certainly not about encouraging children to abuse violence or actively bully others with violence. Allowing children to fight should be limited to conflict resolution, not bullying of classmates. You need to express your anger and give a warning before taking action, rather than fighting randomly. A few simple rules can be understood by children. This kind of reasoning and exchange is far more conducive to improving children&#39;s understanding of the world than a crude prohibition of &quot;fighting is wrong.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teaching children to develop courage is actually not easy. It is inevitable for adults to be submissive, but children are weak and often isolated. At this time, they need help from adults (especially parents). After understanding the reason for our son&#39;s fight, we stated the facts to the teacher and expressed our support for the child. The two parents met, apologized and understood, and the matter was resolved satisfactorily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Children fighting&quot; actually does not require much input from parents. The biggest pressure that children face every day comes from school. Teachers misunderstand punishments, cage management during breaks, and unnecessary extracurricular tasks... These need to be examined by parents and help their children withstand the pressure. My wife and I will help our child complete the assigned tasks and reassure him: It&#39;s not your fault that you didn&#39;t do it well, and it doesn&#39;t matter if the teacher asks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Family is the most important place for children to grow, and parents are their best teachers. Courage, integrity, cheerfulness, optimism... these qualities are difficult to learn in school, and may even be erased. Parents need to take responsibility at this time and pass on values ​​to their children. This is not only character education for children, but also a process of constant reflection and re-growth for parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访世界银行原副行长祝宪：中国发展历程是不同于西方的现代化“药方”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260569]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 13:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As the largest source of funds for developing countries, the World Bank’s economic forecast reports and economic warnings have always attracted much attention . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1980, the third year of reform and opening up, China restored its representation and membership status in the World Bank, and received its first loan from the World Bank the following year. In the following thirty years, China became a protagonist on the world economic stage due to its reform and opening up. It transformed from a borrower of the World Bank to a major shareholder and played an important role in global economic cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China is also the third largest shareholder of the Asian Development Bank (&quot;ADB&quot;) and one of the initiators of the BRICS New Development Bank (&quot;New Development Bank&quot;). By participating in multiple international financial institutions, including the World Bank, China has integrated into the international economic order. After regaining its seat in the World Bank, what else did China get besides loans? As the status of the World Bank continues to improve, what has China contributed to the World Bank? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Xian, who is currently the Executive Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the International Financial Forum (IFF), has served in the Ministry of Finance for a long time, and has successively served as China’s Executive Director of the World Bank, Vice President and Chief Ethics Officer of the World Bank He is the official, vice president and chief operating officer of the BRICS New Development Bank. He is a witness to my country’s long-term cooperation with international financial institutions such as the World Bank. He is also an experienced promoter of my country’s introduction of international funds to accelerate domestic innovation after reform and opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the &quot;IFF 20th Anniversary Global Annual Conference&quot; held recently, Zhu Xian accepted an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend and said that the World Bank plays an important role in China&#39;s reform and opening up process, not only providing loans, but also playing an important role in policy Suggestions, institutional innovation and talent cultivation play an important role, and their role cannot be ignored. At the same time, the World Bank began to promote China&#39;s successful experience in reform and opening up, because China&#39;s development process is different from the Western &quot;prescription&quot; for modernization. This is a very important reference for other developing countries. China also actively participates in global governance through international organizations and tells China&#39;s story to the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Xian also emphasized that China’s reform and opening up must continue to move forward, relying on innovation and becoming an indispensable part of the world economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/CVbbOeohfYI9YrRiI9o7LXuesKxQ9Q4HWb43a4EE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;766&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/CVbbOeohfYI9YrRiI9o7LXuesKxQ9Q4HWb43a4EE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258178&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhu Xian: Former Vice President and Chief Ethics Officer of the World Bank, former Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the New Development Bank; currently Executive Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the International Financial Forum. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;First opening&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;International&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong >;Pioneering bidding system&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1980, China resumed A legal seat at the World Bank (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;World Bank&quot;). Information shows that at the beginning of reform and opening up, the cooperative relationship between China and the World Bank was mainly about receiving aid. You were working in the Ministry of Finance at the time and served successively as deputy director of the World Bank Department, deputy director of the National Debt Department and director of the International Department, etc., so you became closely associated with the World Bank. What was the first project China received assistance from the World Bank? What is the historical background? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China is a founding member of the World Bank. In April 1980, Robert Strange McNamara, then President of the World Bank, was invited to visit China and was received by Deng Xiaoping. Deng Xiaoping said a very famous and courageous saying at that time, &quot;We have fallen behind these years, and we have to catch up. I hope the World Bank can help us, but even without this help, we are determined to catch up.&quot; This was Comrade Xiaoping&#39;s words. The original words are also a tone-setting speech. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, China resumed its legal seat in the World Bank. In July of the same year, the World Bank sent its first high-level delegation to China for inspection and subsequently submitted a detailed inspection report to the World Bank Board of Directors. This is the first step for the World Bank to launch a loan project in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Lubuge&quot; Hydropower Station was China&#39;s first project using World Bank loans and implementing international bidding in the early 1980s. As a key national construction project of the year, the &quot;Lubuge&quot; Hydropower Station is known as the &quot;window&quot; for China&#39;s hydropower capital construction projects to open to the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to obtaining a loan, what changes has this project brought? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the era of planned economy, China’s infrastructure construction projects were mainly established through mandatory plans. After receiving financial allocations or budget allocations, Construction of designated state-owned enterprises. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to the loan agreement signed with the World Bank, some projects in Lubuge must implement international bidding. This was a completely new thing at the time, and of course there was resistance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I happened to work in the Ministry of Finance in 1984. At that time, with the help of the World Bank, a total of engineering contractors from 8 countries, including state-owned enterprises, participated in the bidding. In the end, Japan&#39;s Dachen Company won the bid, and the winning price was 43% lower than the lowest bid price. After entering the company, it only sent a management team of more than 30 people and used the &quot;on-site recruitment&quot; model to form a construction team of more than 400 people. It managed the company according to a contract system and paid workers according to their work efficiency. This changed the “big pot” model of state-owned enterprises at that time. Workers are no longer paid the same amount, but are distributed according to their work. In the end, not only the construction cost was greatly reduced, but the construction efficiency was also greatly improved, and the project progress was significantly accelerated. The project was completed in 1986, five months ahead of schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the introduction of foreign advanced equipment, technology and management experience, the &quot;Lubuge&quot; hydropower station project has become a benchmark for my country&#39;s infrastructure construction to open to the outside world. In 1987, the State Council held a special meeting to require the comprehensive promotion of the &quot;Lu Buge Experience&quot; in the construction industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident later became known as the &quot;Lu Buge Shock&quot;. It is the first of its kind in China to launch global bidding, with price, efficiency and quality as its core assessments. It’s not just the World Bank loan we received, but more importantly these institutional changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Help China&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Promote market reform&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to being the first to launch a bidding system, what profound impact has the &quot;Lu Buge Experience&quot; had on China&#39;s reform and opening up? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From the perspective of project management and financing conditions, the &quot;Lubuge Experience&quot; has influenced China&#39;s infrastructure construction for more than 30 years since then. . The bidding system has since been gradually promoted in the country, and today almost all major infrastructure projects in the public budget must go through bidding. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of the World Bank, the impact on China from the 1980s to the 1990s was not only the provision of loans, but also a lot of pioneering work in institutional innovation and talent training. It played an important role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From my experience, this role is no less important than providing loan funds, especially during the transition from a planned economy to a market economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In what aspects is this importance mainly reflected? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time we didn’t quite know how to transform the socialist market economy. The World Bank conducted a comprehensive investigation of the Chinese economy and then wrote targeted recommendations and reports, some of which were praised by the top leadership at the time. The World Bank also recommended that governments at all levels, especially central ministries and commissions such as the Ministry of Finance, the People&#39;s Bank of China and the National Development and Reform Commission, carry out institutional innovation, which has had a relatively large impact. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, in the process of dealing with international organizations such as the World Bank, our country has also trained a group of market reform talents. For example, Zhou Xiaochuan, Lou Jiwei, etc. all gained their knowledge during exchanges with the World Bank and played an important role in market reform. I was still relatively young at the time, but I also got exercise during my exchanges with the World Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, not all World Bank recommendations are in line with China&#39;s national conditions, but many of the policy recommendations put forward at that time were based on economic surveys conducted in China, as well as exchanges with domestic officials and scholars, and after comparison with international experience. Feedback to China. So overall a lot of good advice was accepted and became reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;From&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;borrower&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;to&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;significant shareholder&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From an official of the Chinese Ministry of Finance working in conjunction with the World Bank, to serving as China&#39;s executive director in the World Bank, and even to the world Vice President of the Bank. With the reform and opening up, while your personal role is changing, China&#39;s status in the World Bank is also improving. During your tenure at the World Bank, if you looked at China from a different perspective, what would be the differences? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After the restoration of the legal seat of the World Bank, as a major country, China has obtained a seat on the executive director, joining the United Nations permanent members such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Like the Governing Council members, they have separate offices at the World Bank. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a sense, the Executive Director of the World Bank is an official sent by China, not an official of the World Bank itself. Before and after I took office, many people held this position, such as Li Yong and Zhang Shengman before me, and Zhu Guangyao and Zou Jiayi after me. I feel very honored to be able to perform my duties at the World Bank on behalf of my motherland, and it is also a heavy responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the improvement of comprehensive national strength, China’s influence in the World Bank has gradually expanded. The World Bank began to promote China&#39;s successful experience in reform and opening up, firstly, to get rid of absolute poverty, and secondly, to promote the transformation of the planned economy into a socialist market economy through infrastructure construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very important reference for other developing countries. At the same time, China is also actively participating in global governance and telling China’s story to the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What milestone events remain fresh in your memory? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;During my tenure at the World Bank, there were two milestone events that impressed me deeply: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;First, China’s loan scale from the World Bank reached US$3 billion per year for the first time. That was $3 billion more than thirty years ago. The World Bank&#39;s low-cost funds have become one of the most important channels for my country to introduce foreign investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using these funds, our country built a number of major infrastructure projects at that time. For example, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Expressway connecting Beijing and Tianjin was my country’s first inter-provincial and municipal expressway built with World Bank loans. This is the first project in China to introduce the construction of a supervisory system. The World Bank insists on giving priority to quality, strictly controls the progress and quality of the project, and will not sign for payment if it does not meet the standards, thus avoiding potential quality hazards caused by the rush period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, China has experienced a change in its role from a borrower to an important shareholder. In 1999, when I first joined the World Bank, China still ranked sixth in terms of voting rights. Now China has become the third largest shareholder of the World Bank. Although we still borrow money from the World Bank, as an important shareholder of the World Bank, our participation in the international financial market has gradually increased, and our influence on world economic development has gradually increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend: From a borrower to an important shareholder, how does China currently influence the world economy through the World Bank? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Xian: Compared with developed countries as shareholders, China’s role in the World Bank is different. For other developing countries, China&#39;s successful experience in reform and opening up has strong reference significance. Because China itself is a developing country, China&#39;s development process is different from the Western &quot;prescription&quot; for modernization, providing more practical experience in poverty alleviation and infrastructure construction. Therefore, China plays an increasingly important role in maintaining the international economic order and improving the global governance structure, and its influence in international organizations such as the World Bank is growing. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Compared with the World Bank, the New Development Bank has made breakthroughs and innovations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have successively held leadership positions in the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (referred to as &quot;ADB&quot;) and the BRICS New Development Bank (referred to as &quot;New Development Bank&quot;). How does China exert its influence and role through different international financial organizations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are two reasons why I moved from the World Bank to the Asian Development Bank: First, we had fewer senior staff in international organizations at that time; And ADB happens to have a spot. Because I have experience working in the World Bank, the Ministry of Finance recommended me for an interview. Second, my professional ability in participating in promoting the World Bank&#39;s poverty alleviation project in western China has been recognized by all aspects of the World Bank. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this is the general background that China has been highly recognized by international organizations such as the World Bank because of its reform and opening up. Without China&#39;s reform and opening up, there would be no experience for me and Chinese people like me in international organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From my personal experience, working in the Ministry of Finance in the first half and working in multilateral international organizations in the second half are completely different experiences. I have witnessed China transform from a poor and backward country to the second largest in the world. the entire process of the economy. The experience of working in an international organization, especially promoting China&#39;s experience to other developing countries and promoting the development of poverty alleviation, is a very glorious career for me. In this process, the biggest challenge is how to balance maintaining Chinese characteristics and integrating with international standards. I hope this will attract the attention of young people currently working in international organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The BRICS New Development Bank was officially established in Shanghai in 2015. China is one of the five largest shareholder countries and one of the initiators. Compared with the World Bank and AIIB, what innovations does it have? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;According to the agreement between the five major shareholder countries at the beginning of the establishment of the New Development Bank, the first president will be an Indian, and the other four shareholders will Each country appoints a vice president. As the vice president in charge of business at that time, the first problem I faced was to clarify what kind of services the new bank would provide. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with multilateral international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, the New Development Bank was entirely initiated and established by emerging market countries. However, the main business nature of the New Development Bank is different from that of multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank. The institutions are relatively similar, and the clients are mainly developing countries. Therefore, we decided to learn from the good experiences and practices of the World Bank and ADB in related business fields, while avoiding the bureaucracy and efficiency problems common in international institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to be different from the World Bank&#39;s practice of attaching policy conditions when approving loan applications from developing countries, we proposed not to set loan conditions at the beginning of the establishment of the New Development Bank and respect the policies of different applicant countries. At the same time, in terms of &quot;environmental and social security policies&quot; and other aspects, the New Development Bank innovatively adopts a &quot;domestic system&quot; and implements it in accordance with the borrowing country&#39;s own lending policy. It is no longer like traditional multilateral financial institutions that impose a &quot;one size fits all&quot; policy on all borrowing countries. &quot;Acceptance effectively reduces the time and cost of borrowing countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another innovation is the adoption of &quot;local currency loans.&quot; Since the New Development Bank&#39;s funds mainly come from the local currencies of the five major shareholder countries rather than US dollars, the New Development Bank&#39;s loans are basically invested in the infrastructure of the host country. If these infrastructures generate income, its income will basically come from the host country and be in the form of It is reflected in the form of the country&#39;s local currency. Therefore, if the country borrows RMB and repays it in US dollars, it will create exchange rate risk. If you borrow local currency and repay local currency, there will be no exchange rate risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although compared with &quot;old banks&quot; such as the World Bank and Asia, the New Development Bank still needs to continue to work hard in many aspects, during my five-year term, the loan scale of the New Development Bank has increased from 0 to 0. $30 billion, pretty good. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;High-end service industry should have characteristics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(IFF) was initiated and established by leaders of more than 20 countries and regions including China, the United States, Britain, and Japan, as well as relevant international organizations and global financial institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It is known as &quot;F20&quot;, its permanent venue is located in Nansha, Guangzhou. What role will IFF play in the integrated development and high-level opening up of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;IFF settling in Guangzhou is a mutual achievement. The Greater Bay Area has a developed economy and a high degree of marketization and internationalization, while IFF is globally representative and inclusive. This is also the significance of IFF settling in the Greater Bay Area and Guangzhou, to build a platform for non-governmental exchanges between scholars and enterprises. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Nansha, Guangzhou, Hengqin, Zhuhai and Qianhai, Shenzhen Finance is at the forefront of China&#39;s reform and opening up. What are your expectations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From a development perspective, Guangzhou should focus not only on investment in the real economy, but also on investment in the service industry, especially in areas such as finance. High-end service industry. In the past, manufacturing industry could attract foreign investment by demarcating a certain area with tax exemptions and other preferential treatment, but it is different now. The service industry needs to be opened up and needs institutional construction. The service industry differs from manufacturing in that services are more mobile. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, institutional openness means integrating with international standards. Now when local governments at all levels consider attracting foreign investment, they should not only focus on the manufacturing industry, but also the service industry, and need to explore new institutional opening-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also hope that the forum can make a contribution, at least to promote dialogue between the two parties. For example, the Nansha District government hopes to attract investment through us, but we suggest that manufacturing investment is no longer urgent for Nansha District, and what Guangdong needs now is not just manufacturing. While the manufacturing industry should be upgraded, investment in the service industry should have its own characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What special finance do you think should be developed in the Greater Bay Area? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The Greater Bay Area has huge demand for financial services. Greater Bay Area finance not only includes traditional bank loans and capital operations, but also digital finance and green financial services. In the process of continuous economic integration in the Greater Bay Area, we will provide enterprises with a full range of financial services, innovate in connectivity, and help the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area become a world-class bay area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area must become a world-class bay District, what do you suggest? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is still a long way to go for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to become a world-class bay area. First of all, compared with the Yangtze River Delta, the Greater Bay Area has institutional advantages, namely the three legal systems of &quot;one country, two systems&quot;. Secondly, dare to innovate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not just the Greater Bay Area. As China continues to move forward, it must rely on reform and opening up, rely on innovation, and become an indispensable part of the world economy. To correctly understand &quot;double circulation&quot;, &quot;inner circulation&quot; and &quot;external circulation&quot; are an organic whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, geographical factors cannot be ignored. The achievements China has made today are the direct result of reform and opening up. In other words, under the new situation, both cooperation and competition are needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国足球的“12岁退役”现象]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260557]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/14/7cca7c7bf41d87e4925b98a3d0ee722d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/14/7cca7c7bf41d87e4925b98a3d0ee722d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258167&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The phenomenon of &quot;retiring at the age of 12&quot; is something that Chinese football, which is full of opportunities, has to face painfully and deeply. A question of powerlessness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the U13 competition of the Key Cities Group of the Chinese Football Association Youth Football Championship (referred to as the &quot;Key City Group Competition&quot;) held in Qingdao at the end of October, tournament officials, coaches, and parents discussed this topic hotly and eagerly sought answers. A competition supervisor from Beijing told reporters that he deplored the changes in a youth team he had followed in the &quot;Hundred Teams Cup&quot; competition in Beijing in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Those 10- and 11-year-old kids can play football better than we did when we were kids, but by the age of 12, half of the kids disappeared; by the time they were 13, they couldn’t play football anymore. He left. I went to ask the coach: &#39;Where are the people?&#39; He said that he spent four years training those children, and they just got a little bit in shape. When they entered junior high school, the team was disbanded.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; &#39;Retiring at the age of 12&#39; is a phenomenon unique to us. If this problem is not solved, youth training will be cut in half and it will be difficult to achieve results,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Since the widespread introduction of campus football, the number of players playing football has increased sharply in primary schools, but by the junior high school stage, that is, after the age of 12, there has been a sharp decline. &lt;/span>;This phenomenon appeared as early as 2018, when the organizers of the Beijing “100 Team Cup” announced a set of numbers about participating teams: there were 229 participating teams in the U8 and U9 primary school age groups, while U13 and U15 There are only 70 participating teams in the middle school age group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Last year, reporters went to Xi&#39;an for research. The person in charge of the youth training of a local district and county football association said that among the echelons affiliated to their football association, there were more than 50 children in the U8 echelon; more than 20 in the U10 team; and only 10 in the U12 team. The left and right children cannot form a team alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A local youth training coach said that parents’ choice determines whether their children play football and also determines the quality of the youth training. He said: &quot;In the past, when we played football, our parents supported us, and the time spent playing football every day was longer than the time spent studying. Now it is just the opposite, and parents focus on studying. &lt;span>; There is no shortage of children with football talents in China. What is the support of parents? All are important. The future of Chinese football is in the hands of parents.&lt;/span>;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Parents&#39; concerns&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen U13 women&#39;s football captain Lian Yutong every day Every time you go out to compete, one of your parents must accompany you. This time it was her father who accompanied her to Qingdao to participate in the key city group competition. He carried a projector from Shenzhen, not to play game videos, but to give his children online classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When the child comes out to compete, as long as conditions permit, her mother and I will definitely have someone accompany her, mainly to provide her with extra lessons.&quot; Lian Lian said, &quot;The child is only 13 years old and does not have that much self-discipline.

For example, when I was in the sixth grade of elementary school, I was guaranteed at least four trainings and one game a week. &quot;It&#39;s absolutely fine to balance studying and playing football in elementary school.&quot; But in junior high school, the academic pressure suddenly increased. Lian Yutong was still able to train three times a week in the first grade of junior high school. After entering the second grade of junior high school this year, he really couldn&#39;t find the time. He could only put all the training on two days on the weekend and twice a week, leaving no training for the five days in between. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After children enter the second grade of junior high school, they only sleep 6 hours a day on average. Time is too precious. Sometimes they have to rush to train and have to eat in the car.&quot; Lian Lian said, &quot;In junior high school, if you want to If you play football, you will delay your studies; if you want to study, you will not be able to play well. You cannot have both.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lian Lian said that Lian Yutong&#39;s school has a high school entrance examination admission rate of only over 40%, which means that This means that she must be in the upper reaches of her class rankings to have any hope of being admitted to high school. This year Lian Yutong spent two months away training and competing, and his academic performance showed a downward trend. This made Lian Lian worried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now their father and daughter have two choices: focus on studying or focus on playing football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lian Lian said that focusing on study is a stable choice. Children can enter college and find a stable job in the future. But Lian Yutong likes to play football, and her parents respect her hobby. &quot;She really loves football, otherwise we wouldn&#39;t have to worry so much.&quot; But focusing on football is gambling with the child&#39;s future. There are too many uncertain factors in football and the success rate is too low, so learning cannot be lost. So, they can only do both. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/e51f43f59c69232015bc7fd34005c8c8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/e51f43f59c69232015bc7fd34005c8c8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258170&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 11, Lian Yutong (second from right) watched the game video with his parents and sister at home in Shenzhen.

He was in a dilemma. “We can only walk and watch one day at a time,” he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lian Lian said that parents of children who play football often get together to discuss how to choose. Everyone is very anxious, and many choose to let their children give up football and study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The club Lian Yutong joined in elementary school had several teams for each age group, with the most teams from A to E5. The children went to play football after school in the afternoon.

Head coach Zhou Ying said that she has been taking her players to training and competitions since they were in the third or fourth grade of elementary school. As a team, they do not suffer from the &quot;12-year-old retirement&quot; phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This team receives training at Suzhou Sports School. The reporter asked Wang Jianjun, vice chairman of the Suzhou Football Association and vice president of Suzhou Sports School, about this. His written answer is as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The phenomenon of &#39;retiring at the age of 12&#39; has not happened in Suzhou. The main reason is that when we select outstanding talents, we talk to the parents about their children&#39;s future. We will build A good platform allows parents to choose: 1. Help every child go to college, and focus on training, competition, and study. If you can&#39;t go to a professional club, you can find a respected job after graduation through college study. 2. Help particularly outstanding children enter the national team. 3. Can’t enter the national team but can be selected for the provincial team, represent the provincial team in the National Games and get the top three (Jiangsu Province has a policy that the top three in the National Games (can be placed in a job), and also solves the worries. 4. The requirement for coaches is not only to complete training and competition tasks, but more importantly, to cultivate each child to become a plastic talent with comprehensive development of morality, intelligence and physical fitness, so that every family Don’t worry. 5. At the high school stage, if children and parents want to go abroad to play football and study, we will also help them solve it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;So I think as long as the problem of children’s future can be solved, there will be no problem. The &#39;retirement at 12&#39; phenomenon,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/97c4f2bf4f241214f1cd239406ac595f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;657&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/97c4f2bf4f241214f1cd239406ac595f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258172&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 15, 2022, the female football team members of Shengping Experimental Primary School in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province were training. Published by Xinhua News Agency (Microphoto by Hang Xing)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The phenomenon of &quot;retiring at the age of 12&quot; is an unavoidable problem in Chinese football. The Chinese Football Association has begun to take measures to improve the youth training environment in the past two years, and recently established the policy of &quot;making youth training a top priority.&quot; &lt;/span>;The Qingdao venue of this key city group U13 competition specially organized a training class for women’s football coaches. Responsible departments in key football cities have held several similar coaching trainings, with the aim of comprehensively improving the capabilities of grassroots coaches. In addition, they also hope that key cities will open &quot;through trains&quot; for further studies to create conditions for football talents to further their studies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U10 to U15 age group competitions in key city group events provide a key platform for the growth of players of the right age. Without this platform, Lian Yutong may not have the opportunity to participate in high-level national competitions. &quot;She has played a total of 12 11-a-side national matches so far, all of which are in key city groups this year.&quot; Lian Lian said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingdao U13 women&#39;s football coach Yu Minglei said after the team&#39;s victory over the Wuhan team: &quot;Children&#39;s growth requires such high-level competitions. Such competitions must be held more often.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Even if the youth training environment improves, it is not enough to break the phenomenon of &quot;retiring at the age of 12&quot;. A local football worker said helplessly: &quot;Actually, the Football Association doesn&#39;t have much to do here. You can&#39;t stop other people&#39;s children from going to school.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A coach said that parents need their children to have a secure future in football. , &quot;We can&#39;t provide them with guarantees, and we can only watch some very good young talents leaving football.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Retiring at the age of 12&quot; has led to the loss of a large number of football talents. This phenomenon is not limited to 12 years old, but it is more prominent in this age group. Some children give up football earlier or later. &lt;span>;This is a reflection of the contradiction between learning and training in the field of football youth training, which needs to be solved through a two-pronged approach. Unless this phenomenon is broken, it will be difficult for Chinese football to thrive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[城市漫步丨洛城机密]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260542]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 12:05:41&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/13/gynCLkJT3JTZFvdKWSGUoMmmLVN4e1L8HuQkDoPc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;615&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/gynCLkJT3JTZFvdKWSGUoMmLBVN4e1L8 HuQkDoPc. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258153&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Downtown Los Angeles. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1974, when the famous German director Werner Herzog heard that the film critic When his mentor Lotte Eisner was critically ill, he did not board the next plane or train, but insisted on walking from Munich to Paris. It was a winter with blizzards, and this journey would take at least several weeks. However, Herzog firmly believed: &quot;As long as I walk through it with both feet, she will survive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes. Think of Herzog&#39;s actions as a private bet with fate: If I complete this audacious challenge, you must honor my wish. The English translation of &quot;Of Walking in Ice&quot;, which records this journey, calls Herzog&#39;s walking trip a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; in the introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also enjoy long walks. However, many American cities are built for cars and not for walking. There is a similar situation in many cities. The distance from point A to point B seems to be very close in a straight line, but there are no so-called shortcuts. Some are just detours. A ten-minute drive will take an hour to walk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I still choose to walk, of course not as a means of commuting every day, but as a way to &quot;empty time&quot; on weekends. In the United States, except maybe a few cities on the East Coast, most cities don&#39;t offer a good &quot;city stroll&quot; experience. But sometimes I feel that the so-called good &quot;city stroll&quot; experience is the discipline of modern business society for consumers. We look forward to marking important landmarks on the map: streets provide &quot;views&quot;, buildings provide &quot;history&quot;, museums provide &quot;condensed knowledge&quot;, restaurants provide delicious food, and coffee shops provide rest. Then we will visit each point one by one and think to ourselves Know this place inside and out. As everyone knows, we are just doing what ordinary tourists do in these places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Real walking is exposing the body to desolation. During my first year in the United States, I was in Iowa, a university town surrounded by large cornfields. Out of curiosity, I walked the way back when I could take the school bus, but what I passed was actually wild grass growing all over the sky. Occasionally, I passed by There are several large box-shaped gymnasiums and school buildings. There is no one on the road, only me and a few birds with colorful wings. The birds seemed to find me strange. They stopped on the branches and stared at me for a long time before flying away. There is no simple dichotomy between good and evil in nature. Several times I have witnessed the corpses of birds after being attacked by wild cats. Sometimes I accidentally entered the &quot;crime scene&quot; and I saw wild cats half-hidden in the grass, using their vicious claws. It looked at me, afraid that I would steal its prey. Another time, I met a small snake &quot;crossing the road&quot; by the river. The hairs all over my body stood up. Should I continue walking forward or go back? I hesitated, and then I realized that the little snake might also be afraid of me. It curled up and was thinking about whether to move forward or backward. This mutual fear actually dispelled my fear. Soon, it ran into the grass on the opposite side, and I continued walking forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In cities, especially in American cities, streets also have a wild and natural feel. Driving people can reduce their &quot;waste&quot; time to a minimum, and they can also use metal and car window glass to build freedom and safety. Walking does not offer this option. In Los Angeles, although there are very convenient buses and light rail services for me to go home from the city center, it still often takes me more than an hour to walk back. The landscape of the city will change immediately. In front of it are still high-rise buildings and Mexican vendors selling food along the street. Across the street are overpasses covered with graffiti and homeless people in ragged clothes talking to themselves. Because you have to pass them by when walking. However, the nasal cavity was invaded by the smell of urine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have no intention of beautifying this kind of walking behavior. I did it partly because I still haven’t passed the driver’s license test, and partly because of my childhood habits. Not only in Los Angeles, but I also walked this way in St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago, and even walked through a few neighborhoods that required a little caution. Such behavior is considered risky by many people. Occasionally, there are reports of delirious homeless people attacking passers-by in the news. But in reality, it&#39;s more of a discomfort than a danger if you&#39;re like me, who looks like a downright poor person (just look at my phone and shoes to keep me from stealing) and is always walking in broad daylight. on the main road below (in case of crisis, you can seek help on the driveway). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also wish I could tell you that I gained countless stories from walking like this, but that is far from the truth. Stories rely on more purposeful interviews, research, and observation. I love Herzog&#39;s &quot;Snow and Ice&quot; because of his honesty. He wrote about the desolation and perhaps meaningless encounters during the walk: &quot;The dark and lonely forest surrounded me, and there was deathly silence around me. Only the wind was howling. .The sky in the west turned yellow, the air was stuffy, as if hail was about to fall, and the sky above was hazy gray-black. Suddenly, a huge red quarry appeared in front of us: red water accumulated in the huge pit. An excavator is parked in the water, rusty and useless.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it can&#39;t be said that I learned nothing. The beggars I met in different places greeted you in different ways. Beggars in Detroit would show off your clothes, while beggars in Chicago would first offer you a favor (someone helped me carry my suitcase directly off the subway). station), panhandlers in Los Angeles will complain to you. With limited experience, my observations of these areas may not be accurate. However, my friends in Detroit also told me that the locals attach great importance to fashion, and even beggars will often praise their clothes. I suddenly felt that I was walking in the real scene of this city. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, everyone has their own reasons for walking. The nineteenth-century American writer Thoreau hiked in New England in order to breathe the air of the planet at the height of the stars and gain knowledge of the earth with his feet. However, after Herzog&#39;s three-week stroll, when he arrived in Paris, Lot Eisner miraculously improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I remembered a past event from my childhood. I was probably only five or six years old at the time, and my father especially liked to lie down on the bed and ask me to step on his back with my bare feet, saying it was the most comfortable massage in the world. I was very happy after hearing this and &quot;walked&quot; on his back very seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, my father and I have never been so close. Like my mother, I despise him for being &quot;unmotivated&quot; and &quot;irresponsible&quot;, and even stinks of sweat in summer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps, somewhere in the world, only walking around on the streets makes me feel so intimate with the city beneath my feet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都崇州被狗咬伤女童已出院，身体各系统恢复顺利]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260555]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 11:12:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On November 14, reporters learned from West China Hospital of Sichuan University that a dog bitten someone in Chongzhou, Chengdu The girl received active treatment from the hospital and was discharged on November 13. &lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;Currently, the liver and kidney functions are normal, various body systems are recovering smoothly, and the wound is healing well. &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Follow-up needs to be reviewed regularly according to doctor’s orders.

The lights above his head light up in sequence with the owner&#39;s steps. In the middle of the room, there is a square box. The electric door of the square box opens automatically, revealing a private space equipped with a large-screen TV and a bed. The owner can rest here, watch movies and play games without being disturbed. The lights in the room can change color according to the mood of the owner. Sometimes it is bright white, and sometimes it turns to warm orange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone who has ever dreamed of science fiction would want to own such a cool cyberpunk-style house. Well-known digital blogger Li Jieling is also one of them. Therefore, when he saw the designer&#39;s plan, he immediately decided to participate in the decoration variety show &quot;Miracle Renewal Home&quot; and spend more than one million to renovate his house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the design is beautiful, but it is not that easy to implement. Recently, Li Jieling posted on Weibo, complaining that the decoration was &quot;overturned&quot; and cost a huge amount of money, but it was far from achieving the results he expected. According to the articles, photos, videos and other information published by Li Jieling, as well as the contract he signed with the decorator, the electric door is 150,000 yuan, the lighting system is 185,000 yuan, and the black square device is 290,000 yuan, plus design fees, transportation and installation fees Waiting for miscellaneous charges, the total charge for these three major items is 730,000 yuan, plus the decoration in other places, the total cost exceeds one million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But after spending such a large amount of money, we did not get very good results: the electric door only has a simple sliding function, and the promised cool effect was not realized at all; the electric door of the square box opened the door, stretched out the chair, etc. There are also many problems with the structure. Firstly, the gaps are too large to form a complete whole, and the appearance is not beautiful enough. Secondly, the operation is very slow and the sound is loud; only the lighting system can pass the test. Due to the huge gap with psychological expectations, Li Jieling finally refused to take over the house and continue to record the program, and asked the decorator and program owner to make rectifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been many programs on new house decoration and old house renovation, which have attracted many viewers. Many people like to watch house building and decoration programs, hoping to provide some inspiration for their own decoration, or simply to see how other people&#39;s homes look like when decorated. But this is not the first time Li Jieling has &quot;overturned&quot; and caused complaints. The last time that the internet went viral was the &quot;Million Dollar Red Brick House&quot; on the show &quot;Dream Renovator&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old man Du from rural Gansu Province hoped that the program team would help him transform his old house into a modern, western-style and exquisite small foreign-style building. As a result, a designer from Beijing designed the house into a &quot;red brick rough house&quot;. There are exposed red bricks and cement everywhere, as well as hollow brick walls. This cost more than 1.32 million. As soon as the program aired, it aroused strong complaints from netizens. However, some people defended the designer, believing that the designer&#39;s work is actually compatible with the environmental style of the northwest countryside, has considerable artistic quality, and has no problem with practicality. Du Laobo and netizens find it difficult to accept it. In fact, it is influenced by traditional concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe the designer has his own ideas, and this work is also very &quot;modern&quot;. However, when designing, constructing, and decorating, we receive money and are entrusted by others. Shouldn&#39;t we respect the client&#39;s ideas first? ? At the beginning of the design, the designer should communicate with the client in detail about the requirements. Even if the designer has his own ideas, he should obtain the client&#39;s understanding and consent during communication. He should not completely follow his own ideas and &quot;open the blind box&quot; for the client after the construction is completed. At that time, the work was done, and making changes would be a major undertaking, if not impossible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the situation Li Jieling encountered was different from that of Mr. Du. In Li Jieling&#39;s case, there was no problem with the design. In fact, Li Jieling agreed to participate in the show only after she was satisfied with the designer&#39;s plan. But what I didn&#39;t expect is that the ideal is plump, but the reality is very skinny. When the cool design is implemented in reality, not only the effect is greatly reduced, but even the basic beauty is difficult to achieve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the decoration program, the effect was not satisfactory, which attracted the attention of netizens and could be corrected. For example, the house of Mr. Du in Gansu received strong criticism after the program was broadcast. The program team responded that the renovation would continue to be improved and the program team would bear half of the renovation costs. Judging from the follow-up program that was broadcast later, the results after the transformation were quite acceptable. As for the situation Li Jieling encountered this time, because Li Jieling himself is a big V and has a strong influence on social media, he has the capital to bargain with the decorator and the program team. The other party currently agrees to complete the renovation before the Spring Festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should ordinary people do if they encounter such a situation? In reality, house decoration is really a matter of luck. The decoration market is a mixed bag, and homeowners often have to work hard to achieve satisfactory decoration results. Disputes arising from decoration quality are endless. How do ordinary people avoid pitfalls when decorating? Even if you choose a regular decoration company, the decoration company may outsource the specific work to the decoration team; even if you sign a decoration contract with clear agreements on the decoration effect, construction period, etc., and there are breach of contract clauses, all kinds of wrangling will inevitably happen. Li Jieling&#39;s experience further reflects the many pitfalls faced by ordinary people in decoration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
