During the dinner, I accidentally talked about the misfortune of Nie Er, the composer of &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; The place of drowning - the coast of Shonan in Fujisawa Prefecture, Japan. Wang Zhongyi, the editor-in-chief of &quot;People&#39;s China&quot; magazine, asked me about the relationship between Shonan and Naito Hunan and Hunan Province. I knew what was going on but didn&#39;t know why. I was questioned on the spot. So, after returning home and doing some homework, I came up with this fake &quot;place name test&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;891&quot; height= &quot;1185&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255549&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Japanese Sinologist Naito Konan (1866-1934). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the latter first. The relationship between Naito Hunan and Hunan Province is simple, so simple that there is no half-cent relationship. Naito&#39;s halo as a sinologist is so dazzling that when Chinese people talk about this legendary figure, they often make associations: the &quot;Hunan&quot; in Naito&#39;s name must have been &quot;taken&quot; from Hunan Province, and is intentionally or unintentionally reminiscent of When it comes to the &quot;theory of cultural center movement&quot; and the &quot;theory of changes in the Tang and Song Dynasties&quot;, it seems that if you don&#39;t even &quot;roll&quot; your name, you can&#39;t be called a great scholar. However, Japanese intellectuals are mostly limited by the concept of regionalism and take it for granted. Since he is a leader of the Kyoto School, the name &quot;Hunan&quot; must come from Hunan City in Shiga Prefecture adjacent to Kyoto Prefecture, but this lake is not Dongting Lake, but Lake Biwa. In fact, neither of these two arguments is correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Naito Hunan&#39;s name is Tiger Jiro, whose courtesy name is Bingqing and whose nickname is Hunan. In 1866, he was born in Mamauchi Village, Mutsu Province (now Mamauchi, Towada, Shikaku City, Akita Prefecture). Shikaku is located at the northernmost tip of Akita Prefecture, separated from Aomori Prefecture by the boundary lake &quot;Lake Towada&quot;. &quot;Hunan&quot; means the south of Lake Towada. Lake Towada is a double volcanic lake formed by the eruption of the Towada volcano. It has beautiful scenery and is a famous lake in the Tohoku region. It is listed as a &quot;National Cultural Property&quot; as a special scenic spot. In the National Diet Building in the center of Tokyo, huge oil paintings depicting the four seasons of the Japanese archipelago hang on the walls surrounding the central hall. Among them, the summer work is &quot;Lake Towada and Oirase&quot; painted by Tanaka Giichi. In this way, due to the influence of Naito&#39;s Hunan and Kyoto schools, Hunan Province, which was originally out of reach, was forced to be disconnected. Even Hunan City, Shiga Prefecture, which had nothing to do with it, was attached to some kind of connection with Naito, and Naito Lake Towada, my hometown where I grew up, is not mentioned by the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height= &quot;403&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255550&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The oil painting &quot;Lake Towada and Oirase&quot; hanging in the central hall of the Japanese Diet Building. Oirase is a river flowing from Lake Towada. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the former. There is actually no definite conclusion about the connection between Shonan and Hunan Province. Although the interpretation of &quot;Southern Hunan&quot; in &quot;Guangciyuan&quot; (fifth edition) refers to it, it is not clear: ① The name of the scenic spot south of the Xiangjiang River that flows into Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, China. ② The &quot;Sōnan&quot; in the southern part of the ancient Sagami Kingdom was appended to ① and written as &quot;Shonan&quot; as the name for the coastal area of ​​Sagami Bay. That area includes Hayama, Zushi, Kamakura, Chigasaki and other areas. There are many bathing beaches in the summer, making it a summer resort for Keihin. The winter is relatively warm. It is widely developed as residential land. For example, &quot;Shonan Electric Railway&quot; is the general name of the old national railways that connect Tokyo and Numazu (Shizuoka Prefecture) over a medium distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through this explanation, we understand that without Hunan in China, there would be no Shonan in Japan. The next question is: when and how did this spatial &quot;link&quot; occur? In Japan, the expression &quot;Shonan&quot; was first seen in the dictionary &quot;Wa Ming Le Ju Chao&quot; (referred to as &quot;Wa Ming Chao&quot; or &quot;Wa Ming Chao&quot;) in the middle of the Heian period. The etymology is Shonan County, Changsha State. According to the explanation of &quot;Zizhi Tongjian Dictionary&quot; (Jilin People&#39;s Publishing House, 1994): Xiangnan County was &quot;established in the Western Han Dynasty, and its administrative location is southwest of Xiangtan City, Hunan Province. It was changed to the Marquis of Xiangnan in the Eastern Han Dynasty. In the Three Kingdoms, Wu restored it to Xiangnan County. The Southern Dynasties Waste all.&quot; However, &quot;Shonan&quot; in &quot;Japanese Names&quot; is still a simple ancient Chinese place name and is not equivalent to &quot;Shonan&quot; in Japan today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Various evidence shows that the real &quot;crossing of the border&quot; in southern Hunan is related to Zen Buddhism. Mr. Ge Zhaoguang mentioned in &quot;The History of Chinese Zen Thought&quot; that Southern Zen is divided into two branches geographically, and the second branch is the &quot;Zen master group centered on Jingzhou and Hengyue&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, Fa Nao and Fa Ren of Jingzhou Emperor Temple, Fa Jing and Zhiyuan of Changsha Temple, Fa Cong of Xiangyang Jingkong Temple, Lushan Fa Chong wait. Of course, the most important thing is Huisi (515-577) who first went to Daesu Mountain in Gwangju and then to Hengyue, and opened the later Tiantai line. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tiantai Sect is the sect that has had a decisive influence on Japanese Buddhism and Zen Buddhism. In 804 AD, Zen Master Saicho went to the Tang Dynasty to study Dharma as an envoy to the Tang Dynasty. After returning to China the following year, he taught Dharma at the Enryaku Temple on Mount Hiei (also known as Mount Tiantai), and then founded the Tendai Sect of Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Muxi Fachang, a painting monk from the late Song Dynasty to the early Yuan Dynasty (Fachang is the Buddhist name, his birth and death dates are unknown), practiced Zen under the famous monk Wu Zhun when he was young, and later became the founder of Liutong Temple in West Lake. At the end of the Kamakura period (14th century), his paintings flowed into Japan in batches following the exchanges between Chinese and Japanese Zen masters, and they were immediately enthusiastically sought after by the upper class. The technique of using ink halos and a large amount of white space to express the beauty of the universe is superb and sophisticated. It is the &quot;symbol of the literati&#39;s longing for an utopia of natural mountains and rivers&quot; in the eyes of the Japanese (Japanese scholar Yuji Yamashita said), and it has also profoundly influenced Japan. of southern painting. The great Japanese painting masters of the Momoyama period, Hasegawa Tōhoku, Omotaya Sotatsu and others, all sought the foundation of ink painting techniques from Makiki&#39;s paintings; there are also many works that imitated Makiki in the Kano School of art. Muxi&#39;s paintings are the objects of collection by Japanese ministers, daimyo and wealthy businessmen. They are national treasures among national treasures. For example, in the &quot;Catalog of Imperial Paintings&quot;, a record of the painting treasures collected by the Ashikaga family of the Muromachi shogunate, of the total 280 pieces in the collection, Makixi&#39;s works accounted for 30%, as many as 103 pieces. In Japanese documents from the mid-14th century, if only &quot;monk&quot; is written, it is an honorific title for Muxi. Muxi&#39;s paintings are almost extinct in China (only the National Palace Museum and the National Palace Museum in Taipei hold one each). It is said that 134 paintings exist in Japan, all of which are stored in the treasure collections of the Cabinet Office for Culture and the country&#39;s first-class art museums. The &quot;ceiling&quot; of Mu Xi&#39;s work is generally recognized as &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot;. Seven of the eight volumes are in Japan. The location of the remaining volume, &quot;Yamaichi Seiran&quot;, is still unknown and a copy is preserved in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;3197&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255548&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Fishing Village Sunset&quot; from Muxi Fachang&#39;s &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;Xiaoxiang&quot;, the definition of &quot;Cihai&quot; is: ①Another name for the Xiangjiang River, because the water of the Xiangjiang River is clear Well-earned reputation. &quot;The Book of Mountains and Seas·Zhongshan Jing&quot;: &quot;The abyss of the Xiaoxiang River.&quot; &quot;The Book of Xiangzhong&quot;: &quot;The clear light of the Xiangchuan River is five or six feet long, which is the name of Xiaoxiang.&quot; Or it may specifically refer to the section after the middle reaches of the Xiangjiang River meets the Xiaoshui River. That is one of the &quot;Three Hunans&quot;. ②Refers generally to the Hunan region. Zheng Gu&#39;s poem &quot;Farewell to Friends on Huaishang&quot;: &quot;Several bagpipes left the pavilion at night, you went to Xiaoxiang and I went to Qin.&quot; ③The name of the ancient town. It was placed in the Five Dynasties in the northwest of Yongzhou City, Hunan Province. It is named because it is the confluence of Xiaoxiang River and Xiangkou Pass; it is also called Xiaoxiang Pass or Xiangkou Pass. Accordingly, as the name suggests, the &quot;Eight Scenic Spots of Xiaoxiang&quot; refer to the eight scenic spots from the north along the Xiangjiang River to Dongting Lake after the Xiangjiang River merges into the Xiaoshui River. Since the Northern Song Dynasty, some painters have used it as a theme to create works, expressing their feelings for the landscape. The &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; has almost become an artistic paradigm. Famous ones include the scroll of the same name by Song Di, which was later written down by Shen Kuo in &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot;, including Fan Return from Yuanpu, Falling Geese on Pingsha, Evening Bell of Yansi Temple, Qinglan in Mountain City, Dusk Snow in River Sky, Autumn Moon in Dongting, Sunset in Fishing Village, Xiaoxiang Night Talk - the name of &quot;Eight Scenes&quot;, has since &quot;out of the circle&quot;. However, compared with the works of Song Di and others, the Japanese clearly prefer Mu Xi. As for the reason, the philosopher Han Bingzhe believes:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mu Xi&#39;s &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; inspired by Zen Buddhism is also &quot; The picture of &quot;empty&quot;, the pen and ink are simple and subtle, there is nothingness, the artistic conception is mysterious, a few scenes are hidden in the infinite white space, the careful brushwork makes the objects float between reality and virtuality, black and white, and there is no way to express it. meaning. Objects and images are integrated and dependent on each other, reflecting each other instead of driving away or dividing each other. Sora seems to have become a friendly intermediary. Water lives, mountains flow, heaven and earth unite. The emptiness and silence do not obliterate the still life in the painting, but reflect the elegance of the still life. (&quot;Zen Philosophy&quot;, page 35)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, from the Kamakura period to the Edo period, from the Ashikaga Shogun family (Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Yoshimasa) to Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, from the Tokugawa Shogun family (Tokugawa Ieyasu, Yoshimune) to Matsudaira Fumo and Murata Shuguang, Muxi&#39;s &quot;Eight Views of Xiaoxiang&quot; has been circulated among these figures, and its value can no longer be evaluated in terms of money. The Japanese really love the &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; so much that they can&#39;t wait to move them to Japan. Sure enough, later the Japanese &quot;discovered&quot; the &quot;Eight Views of Kanazawa&quot; in the area of ​​Rokuura Village in Musashi Kunakurajo County (today&#39;s Kanazawa Eight Views Station of the Keihin Express Railway) - the whole is a &quot;Hako Garden&quot; version of the &quot;Eight Views of Xiaoxiang&quot; . The wonderful thing is that every scenic spot corresponds to the original scenery of Xiaoxiang, and it was adapted into Ukiyo-e paintings by Utagawa Hiroshige, including &quot;The Return of the Sailing Ship&quot;, &quot;The Falling Geese&quot;, &quot;The Evening Bell&quot;, &quot;Susaki Haru&quot; &quot;Arashi&quot;, &quot;Twilight Snow on Uchigawa&quot;, &quot;Seto Autumn Moon&quot;, &quot;Sunset on Noshima&quot; and &quot;Koizumi&#39;s Night Voice&quot;, a total of eight paintings. In the 7th year of Yuanlu (1694), Zen Master Donggao Xinyue, who fled to Japan from the Ming Dynasty, wrote a Chinese poem for each of the &quot;Eight Scenes of Kanze&quot;. With the endorsement of the seven-character quatrains of the Chinese great scholar, Kanze was like Xiaoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that in the early Edo period, the monk Sawuan began to call the Enoshima area &quot;Shonan&quot;. During the same period, Chongxue, a descendant of the Chinese who immigrated to Japan from China during the Muromachi period and an expectorant medicine merchant in Odawara, built a stone tablet at the Oiso nunnery, on which he engraved the seven words &quot;The end of the Qing Dynasty in southern Hunan&quot;. This monument still exists today and is regarded as the beginning of place names in southern Hunan. Before modern times, Sinology was always a prominent school in Japan. Therefore, whether it was due to a certain literary taste or arty elegance, there were many Zen monks and poets who used &quot;Shonan&quot; as their nickname, such as the Zen monk Shonan Tong, the poet Okubo Shonan, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the opening of the Shonan Electric Railway, the area known as &quot;Shonan&quot; further expanded, and even the Miura Peninsula was included in its division. In May of the 29th year of Meiji (1896), Tokutomi Soho bought a villa on the Zushi Seaside for his parents, and then handed over the task of taking care of the two elders to his younger brother Tokutomi Akasha, and he embarked on a journey around the world. At that time, Luhua was physically and mentally exhausted and tired of the dissolute life. She decided to temporarily go to her parents&#39; villa to live in seclusion while thinking about her future. He wrote in a letter to his brother: &quot;The air in Tokyo is too cold for me. I want to live in Shonan for some time.&quot; At that time, Shonan had become a residential area for the upper class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also at about the same time, Natsume Soseki and Suzuki Daijo each practiced Zen under Enkaku-ji Temple in Kita-Kamakura with the Zen master Shaksumi. Soseki practiced Zen for self-healing, while Dachu practiced Zen for the purpose of learning the Dharma. Time and space intersect, the two have neither the same purpose nor have they met. Since the Kamakura shogunate era, the shogunate rulers have been protected by the clan, and Zen Buddhism has been able to live and develop here. After five centuries of development, by the time Soseki and Daijo practiced Zen, it had become a grand sight. Kamakura, an ancient temple, was lined with many The ancient city, which is full of Zen, has also become a true &quot;Mecca&quot; of Zen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, from the &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; by Muxi Fachang to the &quot;Eight Scenes of Kanze&quot;, from monk Ze&#39;an to the Chinese Zen master who fled eastward, it can be said that it is precisely because of the blessing of Zen Buddhism that This long and narrow coastal area, centered on Enoshima and extending east and west along Sagami Bay, has changed from the ancient place name &quot;Sōnan&quot; to the &quot;Shonan&quot; in the eyes of the world today. It has a unique atmosphere that is completely different from other regions. Romantic style. For example, if people living in the metropolitan area drive a car with a &quot;Shonan&quot; license plate on National Highway 134 on weekends, even if it is just an ordinary light motor vehicle, it is still a cool thing. Its &quot;gold content&quot; even surpasses the high-end residential area &quot;Shinagawa&quot; in Tokyo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Original title &quot;Where is Southern Hunan&quot;, the current title was proposed by the editor)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[学术期刊为何能收那么贵的版面费？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259320]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, an accounting journal in Hubei Province, &quot;Accounting Newsletter&quot;, issued a notice stating that authors who raise families with three children No publishing fee. This was originally a very niche academic journal, and the notice itself could reach a relatively small number of people, but it quickly aroused heated discussion on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reasons for the heated discussion can be attributed to the following aspects: firstly, the page fee of six to seven thousand yuan for an article is not cheap; secondly, the positioning of this journal, which was led by the Hubei Provincial Accountant Sponsored by the Society and directed by the Hubei Provincial Federation of Social Science and Technology, charging high page fees feels more like a commercial practice; the last is this preferential measure, which is very high-profile, but in fact the number of beneficiaries may be very few and can almost be ignored. , it feels more like a promotion. It’s not surprising that the combination of several factors has made it a hot spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I have always known that there is a page fee for publishing papers in academic journals, it is somewhat surprising that the fee for an article is so high. According to its official website, there are 31 articles in the latest issue of the catalog. This journal is published bimonthly. Based on the page fee of 6,000 per article, their monthly income can reach 372,000 yuan, which is 4,464,000 yuan a year. The annual income of a journal is nearly 5 million, which is definitely a good business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the important reasons is that the world has been undergoing a &quot;Great Leap Forward in Higher Education&quot; in recent decades, and the accompanying &quot;paper inflation&quot; behind it. Because China has a large population base and rapid economic development, problems in this area are particularly prominent. It&#39;s just that most of the people involved are &quot;literary people&quot; and are more or less &quot;beneficiaries&quot;. Even if they see the problem, they will not easily pierce this layer of window paper. After all, seeing through but not telling off is also a well-known survival wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the academic qualification inflation is the expansion of undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students. Major universities attach great importance to the number of papers, and basically require graduate students to publish a corresponding number of papers before graduation. Usually, the better the school, the higher the requirements for the level of papers. Every year, students apply to postpone graduation because they have not completed the publication of their thesis. Thesis publication is a necessity for the research community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the expansion of undergraduate and graduate enrollment will inevitably be accompanied by an expansion of the number of teachers. Throughout the education system, there is a tradition of assessing the number of published papers. There are rigid regulations that require publication of papers when promoting teachers&#39; professional titles, applying for scientific research projects, or applying for various scientific research funds. And it’s not just universities that require essays, even primary and secondary schools now have requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the education system, but also hospitals and even some units that are not scientific research institutions will use the number of published papers as an important indicator for promotion. One of the considerations is probably because it seems fair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another consideration is a certain sense of &quot;academic worship&quot;, or &quot;science worship&quot;, as if publishing a paper is making a contribution to scientific scholarship. In fact, for a long time, many places and universities in our country have been pursuing and promoting the &quot;only patents and number of papers theory&quot;. The number of papers and patents has always been the focus of their propaganda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early August this year, the research institute of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan released a report. The report shows that China’s total number of papers accounts for 24.6% of the global share, 8.5 percentage points higher than the second-placed United States. In terms of the number of citations used to measure the quality of papers, China’s global proportions of “attention papers” and “top papers” were 28.9% and 29.3% respectively, ranking first in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We don’t need to belittle ourselves and regard this kind of data ranking as worthless. Objectively speaking, on the one hand, this data shows that China’s scientific research and academic influence is gradually expanding, which is a good thing. But on the other hand, we must also see the contrast between this quantity and reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We often say that &quot;quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes&quot;, but when the number of papers and patents is distorted by the wrong incentive system, quantitative changes may not lead to high-quality qualitative changes. On the contrary, it is more likely to lead to low-level, low-level duplication, and also produce some bizarre &quot;academic research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a few years ago, an academic journal published &quot;It is expected to improve the efficiency of building a clean government culture by targeting intestinal flora to regulate the body&#39;s material needs and desires.&quot; There are many more articles of this kind, which are completely unabashedly &quot;pseudo-academic&quot; and just to make up for the numbers. Under the improper incentive system, publishing papers has become a necessity for many people, and it is a very large &quot;market&quot;. The demand is strong but the supply is limited. There are only so many publications and so many pages, so it basically forms a &quot;seller&#39;s market&quot;, and it is not surprising that the page fees are high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With high prices and huge profits, more people will definitely participate, so this forms an &quot;essay industry chain.&quot; There are writers, there are agents, there are people who are responsible for paying, and there are people who are responsible for publishing. You can basically find various channels as long as you pay. Of course, this &quot;market&quot; is not completely spontaneous, but is caused by a deformed incentive system. Moreover, under this deformity, corruption is likely to breed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Wu Dongfeng, the former editor-in-chief of Qiusuo magazine of the Hunan Academy of Social Sciences, was placed under investigation for serious disciplinary violations. The problem lies precisely in the publication fee. Later, the court determined that Wu Dongfeng had charged nearly 10 million yuan in &quot;page fee&quot; for his paper. The &quot;page fee&quot; for publishing an article in &quot;Qiusuo&quot; magazine can reach up to more than 50,000 yuan, and there are intermediaries responsible for blending these matters. At that time, this case caused great shock in the academic community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to such corruption cases and problems, the &quot;paper industry&quot; has another problem, and that is the &quot;siphon effect.&quot; People in this &quot;industrial chain&quot; were supposed to create wealth, but instead they became &quot;paper brokers&quot;, helping others publish worthless articles to make profits. And some page fees are reimbursed at public expense. Except for those articles that are truly valuable, I am afraid that most of the junk articles are essentially &quot;conspiring to divide the spoils&quot; among many people. Some of them may be dividing taxpayers&#39; money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to change the status quo, I am afraid it is not a headache for the doctor. Not to ask why the page fee is so high, but to ask why so many worthless journals and articles can still live so well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[那些在互联网买“情绪”的年轻人，拜托醒醒吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259422]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;957&quot; height=&quot;637&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people may have heard the melody of &quot;love trading&quot;, but they don&#39;t know that there is also a business of &quot;emotional trading&quot; now. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Emotional Tree Hole&quot;, &quot;Good Luck Spray&quot;, &quot;Scolding to Awaken Love Brain&quot;, &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot;...

To use a popular word nowadays, it is &quot;emo&quot;. Emo was selected as the Internet Word of the Year in 2021. In this year alone, Bilibili users sent &quot;emo&quot; barrages 3.3 million times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;emo&quot; comes from the English word &quot;emotion&quot;, which means emotion. In the 1990s, &quot;emotional hardcore&quot; appeared in the field of European and American pop music, which is a kind of rock music with delicate emotions, melancholy and sentimentality. After being simplified to &quot;emo&quot;, emo also has colors such as impulsiveness, sensitivity, and melancholy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo, which is now a popular vocabulary, continues this core and emotional color, representing the decadent, frustrated, speechless and puzzled mood of young people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo has become a popular word not only because of the principle of &quot;language economics&quot; - this short word accurately summarizes the mentality of young people, and it is not just popular. The &quot;herding effect&quot; in the spread of vocabulary - you use it for other people and I use it for you. What&#39;s more, emo is indeed a universal emotion of the times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo is a new variant of the previously popular words such as &quot;Buddhist&quot;, &quot;mourning&quot; and &quot;lying flat&quot;. It is related to some new changes of the times. For example, in the post-epidemic era, the global economy is recovering slowly and the economic downturn has put young people under greater work pressure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people feel very tired under the &quot;involution&quot;; in the busy urban life, many young people do not have much time to socialize and stay in rental houses after work Here, they will inevitably feel lonely and cold as &quot;empty-nest youths&quot;... In addition to these universal dilemmas, young people also have different and specific confusions in their own lives, which more or less affect their emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In short, young people can emo about everything. I can&#39;t find a job, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m under great pressure at work, I&#39;m emo; I have a conflict with my partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m single and have no partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m not ready for the exam, I&#39;m emo; my plan was rejected by Party A, I&#39;m emo...&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Compared with words such as mourning and lying down, emo has a hint of self-deprecation of joy in suffering. It is not so negative and pessimistic, but after complaining about &quot;I am really emo&quot; , will still clean up the mess of life and move on. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;The comfort of &quot;emotional value&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After emo, you still have to embrace life. Therefore, young people will work hard to calm down their emotions faster and satisfy their emotional needs. They will seek &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, what is emotional value? Simply put, emotional value = positive emotion (benefit) - negative emotion (cost). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Whether a thing or a person has emotional value lies in its ability to bring positive emotional power to people, such as making people feel happy, secure, calm, and warm. , healing... In other words, emotional value is the ability to have a positive impact on our emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be companionship, sharing, listening, encouragement... In the end, it becomes a kind of comfort for emo emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On social media, young people also often use words closely related to emotional value, such as &quot;emotional stability&quot;, which has become the first criterion for many young people to choose a partner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;An emotionally stable partner can always handle things calmly and calmly, without losing control, without blaming each other, and without blaming each other, but working hard to solve problems. A partner who is emotionally stable will naturally bring strong emotional value to others - you will be wrapped in a sense of security, and no matter how chaotic the world is, there will be someone walking hand in hand with you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;With this background, we can understand why many young people buy emotions on the Internet. What they essentially buy is &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If a person has no motivation to study, just join the &quot;virtual study room&quot;, and everyone will study together to have more atmosphere; if you want an illusion of good luck, buy &quot;Good &quot;Yuck Koi&quot;; if you want to get rid of loneliness and gain a sense of companionship, you can place an order for &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, where a seller will role-play a mosquito and &quot;buzz&quot; you from time to time; buy it after a breakup A &quot;scolding to wake up your love brain&quot; is not so much about scolding you as it is about accompanying you, talking to you, and listening to you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;794&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255731 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Not want to buy Just buy it&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is human nature that people like people and things that can provide high emotional value. Keen merchants have also seized this business opportunity - young people need emotional value, and I will sell emotional value. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The question is, can you really buy emotional value if you want to? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If emotional value was such an easy thing to obtain, it wouldn’t be so scarce. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As mentioned above, emotional value is a kind of &quot;ability&quot;. It must really hit your emo point, bring you strength, comfort and help you. You transcend that depression. This is not something you can achieve by typing in a dialog box and the other party saying a few words of chicken soup for the soul; it is not something you can achieve by buying a &quot;Good Luck Koi&quot; or &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot; and you will be blessed with divine help. Falling from the sky; it’s not the other party “inciting emotions”, you will be emotionally liberated...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, those &quot;sell&quot; products on the Internet for a few cents or a few dollars &quot;Emotion&quot; is just a gimmick. The sellers do not have the quality and ability to provide emotional value. They are even more routine and perfunctory than the customer service of some merchants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What young people buy is only a few minutes of freshness, which brings a few minutes of fun to the emo mood. Once the freshness is over, the emo is still the emo, and the problem has not been solved. If so, it&#39;s still not resolved. It&#39;s OK to think of &quot;emotional trading&quot; as a joke, but if you take it seriously, you may be deceived and make you more emo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the final analysis, if there is no one or thing to rely on, then the only one who can bring positive emotional value to yourself is yourself. If you haven&#39;t studied for a long time and feel that you have fallen, you will feel emo, and you think that joining the &quot;virtual study room&quot; will give you motivation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, such heteronomy is in vain. If you have more self-discipline and complete the goals you set every day, you will feel real happiness the moment you complete it - the better. Self-discipline brings freedom; if you don’t work hard at ordinary times, you will feel emo before the exam. You think buying a &quot;good luck koi&quot; will bring you good luck, but you still won’t during the exam. If you study hard and concentrate on preparing for the exam, you will Your hard work will be reflected in the exam, and what you gain is a real sense of solidity and accomplishment...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After all, the value of emotions cannot be bought just because you want to buy them. Buying emotions is a pleasure. Yes, but getting out of emo cannot rely solely on spiritual victory. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《芭蕾舞复仇曲》：韩影越来越套路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259234]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;Among the new generation of Korean actresses, all Zhong Rui is an alternative existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She made her fortune in Li Cangdong&#39;s &quot;Burning&quot;. She stood out from thousands of auditions and performed a large-scale role in her first screen role. The cunning and alienation on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s face, her inadvertent dodge, and a hint of cowardice constitute her rich facial aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her new work &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, she once again demonstrates this highly recognizable performance style. This is her second collaboration with emerging director Li Chongxian. The first time the two worked together was in the 2020 crime suspense film &quot;The Call&quot;, which caused heated discussions among movie fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Ballet In &quot;Revenge Song&quot;, although Jeon Jong-seo is not as crazy as in &quot;Telephone&quot;, the girl she plays, Ok-joo, is also a mistress who is not easy to mess with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Zhu once worked as a bodyguard in a security company, specializing in protecting high-level important personnel. Her superb skills and sharp mind were fully demonstrated in the opening supermarket robbery scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f3a9ec1f3da4106b7a1d835c84f48513.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f3a9ec1f3da4106b7a1d835c84f48513.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255245&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps for a long time Maintaining a high degree of vigilance, Yuzhu had no interest in life and was full of frustration all day long until she met her old classmate Minxi. The latter&#39;s natural affinity frees Yuzhu from the boring quagmire of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to show the contrast in atmosphere, the film specially uses colorful soft light to capture the relaxed and graceful friendship between the two girls when showing Minxi taking Yuzhu to celebrate her birthday, taking headshots and relaxing on the beach. . This is in contrast to the large number of night scenes and indoor scenes throughout the film, which basically use high contrast and low-key lighting to create dangerous and uneasy situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255248&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point of the story , appeared when Minxi suddenly committed suicide, leaving a last word hoping that Yuzhu would help her take revenge. After Yuzhu followed the clues and found a man named &quot;Chef Cui&quot;, she discovered that Minxi&#39;s suicide had a lot to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The many &quot;SM&quot; props in Chef Cui&#39;s home, as well as the large number of classified USB flash drives in the cabinet, all show that in the process of &quot;hunting for beauty&quot;, he often uses perverted methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;444&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255250&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And Minxi , after being targeted by Chef Cui, he was drugged and raped while being filmed on video. Chef Cui did this not only to satisfy his abnormal desires, but also to threaten girls like Minxi through videos and force them to &quot;accept customers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This crime chain is not the work of Chef Cui alone. He also has a pharmacist who regularly cooperates with him, so he can succeed every time with drugs such as &quot;obedient water&quot;; his subordinates also run a peach store. Hotels specialize in soliciting prostitutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6d74c7ae51907124c4f2612d454f78b0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6d74c7ae51907124c4f2612d454f78b0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255247&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the most disappointing thing What people are afraid of is the power behind Chef Cui. Furthermore, Chef Cui, who looks vicious on the surface, is just a small leader of a gang organization, and behind this is a huge black industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3b9fa39ae346614fe6e4adea29bae5a6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;585&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3b9fa39ae346614fe6e4adea29bae5a6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255249&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9588ac4b4e3c43c214228f05c4f44c86.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;581&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9588ac4b4e3c43c214228f05c4f44c86.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255252&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This setting in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; comes from The &quot;Room N&quot; case caused a lot of controversy in South Korea in the past few years. The prisoner in the case, Zhao Zhubin, established a paid &quot;room&quot; on an online platform and used the threatened girls as bargaining chips to profit from it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s just that this film introduces gangster forces and makes sexual crimes bottomless, in order to amplify this despair and anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some time ago, &quot;The Voice of Freedom&quot;, which was adapted from real events, brought to the table the rarely mentioned child abduction and sex trafficking. Although the quality of the film is not good, its discussion of this topic is worthy of recognition. It allows us to see a criminal phenomenon that is deep underground and widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, as Yuzhu deepens her investigation into Chef Cui and the organization behind him, she also only avenges her best friend at the beginning, but gradually transforms into avenging the victimized woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, The killing scenes and action scenes have become the second highlight of this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jeon Jong-seo cannot rely on physical confrontation and impact to create visual stimulation like Stallone and Jason Statham, nor can he use real kung fu techniques like Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Show off a pleasing figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The action design of &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; absorbs the style of the &quot;John Wick&quot; series, that is, it gives full play to the advantages of &quot;gun-shaped&quot; action movies, allowing hot weapons and fists and kicks to be used alternately. Ammunition can create explosive scenes, and the head-on confrontation of fists, feet, knives and axes can highlight the thrilling effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255253&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is at the climax In the scene, Yuzhu used two pistols to fight against the entire gang, which was most obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this alone cannot make up for Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s complement in action scenes, so lens language and editing techniques have become necessary auxiliary means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quick swinging technique, the movement of the camera synchronized with the direction of the punch, and the extensive use of close-up and close-up shots, coupled with the fast and sharp editing style, make the entire movie have a clear rhythm every time it enters the action section. Accelerate and the atmosphere becomes wanton and arrogant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;449&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the director Li Chongxian is familiar with action films such as Hong Kong&#39;s &quot;The Fuse&quot;, Indonesia&#39;s &quot;The Raid&quot; and South Korea&#39;s &quot;Crime City&quot;, so he can create these action scenes with ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the tilted and unbalanced camera images and the neon aesthetics with great color contrast make &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; closer to the style of Hollywood crime films in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;448&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general In other words, the crime theme of exploiting women&#39;s bodies, good fighting scenes, and Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s character arc that is sometimes conservative and restrained, sometimes sensitive and angry, make this film have a sense of entertainment that is above the pass mark. However, when we finish watching &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, we can still detect its frivolity and frivolity based on big data algorithms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the character Ok-joo&#39;s emotions continue to deepen in the process of revenge, this delicate inner change relies more on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s outstanding performance. Why did she become a bodyguard? Why are you so depressed in life? The film never explains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255255&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for her being Min Xi is infected and her heart gradually melts, but it is like going through the motions, and the filming is stereotyped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most puzzling thing is the pretentiousness of the underworld gang, which is strong on the outside but capable on the inside. The boss, who is full of gangster traditions, did not see anything done after he lectured Chef Cui. He neither saw through Chef Cui’s lies nor demonstrated his strategizing of the organization. Only in the contrasting section of &quot;die from talking too much&quot; does it play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255257&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; provides a framework for female revenge, especially in terms of revenge for best friends. It is exactly the same as the summer hit &quot;The Vanishing She&quot;. But when it comes to the specific levels of criminal psychology, social ecology, etc., it seems to be discouraged. It is not like Luo Hongzhen&#39;s &quot;Yellow Sea&quot;, which separates the dirty, angry and restless characters&#39; psychology and shows you in detail. Instead, it provides a visual pleasure for immediate consumption and caters to the public&#39;s emotional fast food. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the inevitable result of Netflix and other streaming media entering the Korean market. It has brought big data arithmetic and more routine formulas, and this may also become a trend in the next few years. , a signal of an overall decline in the quality of Korean films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深圳欢乐谷过山车追尾，有游客称前一天已遇故障]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259498]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 10:19:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project promotion picture.

I found out later that it was a car crash.&quot; Zhao Xin, a student who was queuing at the scene, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Xin said that several students from Shenzhen Huitong School were on the roller coaster where the accident occurred. “Several of them went up to play together. One of them had some stomach injuries because he didn’t have time to get off, and the other one It’s more serious and I passed out.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about 23:00 on the 27th, a Southern Weekend reporter called the customer service of the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital. A staff member on the line said he was unclear about the situation, but said that the current queue time in the emergency department would be It&#39;s very long. &quot;There are more people waiting in the emergency department now.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of Shenzhen Happy Valley, &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; has a five-star thrill level. It is a catapult roller coaster built with a huge investment of 200 million and is the tallest and longest catapult roller coaster in Asia, with a total length of 550 meters. &quot;Speed ​​up in 2 seconds, galloping at 135 kilometers per hour, falling vertically from 60 meters, heart-poundingly crazy for 90 seconds, 4G maximum acceleration, the experience of going to the sky, going to the ground, and going into the sea is thrilling to the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is It is a relatively popular event, and there were a lot of people queuing up today.&quot; Zhao Xin recalled that she had been queuing for nearly two hours.

She told Southern Weekend reporters that there was a problem with the system at that time: &quot;The Snow Eagle made a loud sound when it ejected, but I didn&#39;t hear it at the time, and then I found that the car had returned to the starting position. After a while, , the roller coaster ejected again, and returned to the starting position after a normal run.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yuan recalled that the vehicle system activated the emergency protection device at that time, and tourists on the roller coaster were unable to get off. &quot;The staff used the microphone to inform the remaining people in line that there was a problem with the system and needed to be repaired, so they could not continue playing. They also issued speed passes to the remaining people in line.&quot; Chen Yuan said that everyone stayed on the stalled roller coaster again. After about ten minutes, the staff adjusted and the emergency braking mode was released and we were able to get out of the car. &quot;About two hours after the emergency repairs, Happy Valley notified Snow Eagle to resume operations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Maintenance is done every day&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Shenzhen Happy Valley has been open since 1998 and is a new generation of large-scale theme park of OCT Group.

Its vehicle structure includes two trains (orange car and green car), each train has 6 carriages, and each carriage can accommodate 4 people. There are 24 people in the whole car and 48 people in the two cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, a rear-end collision involving an aerial sightseeing train occurred in Happy Valley.

The notice specifically mentioned that Chen Guifen &quot;violated regulations in accepting gifts and arrangements for beauty activities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, expressions such as &quot;accepting beauty activities&quot; and &quot;addicted to beauty&quot; have appeared many times in official review reports on dismissed female officials. Chen Guifen&#39;s defeat this time has further brought the new term &quot;beauty corruption&quot; to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot; refers to cases of corruption and bribery that occur due to accepting beauty activities. Among the typical cases reported in recent years, the high amount of money involved and the bizarre corruption projects of &quot;beauty corruption&quot; have been breathtaking. The former director of the Anshan Municipal Taxation Bureau Liu Guangming’s “500,000 butt plastic surgery fee”, the latter the former mayor of Manzhouli City Xu Ailian’s “150,000 yuan for a beauty needle”, and the former vice president of North China University of Technology Shen Zhili’s “single consumption of 690,000 yuan” &quot;An astonishing number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to infer from the term &quot;cosmetic corruption&quot; that certain types of corruption are indeed related to gender. Due to the different preferences of men and women, it is not difficult to understand that bribers will cater to them in a targeted manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;willfulness&quot; of power will find an outlet, just like life, to satisfy the individual desires of those who abuse power. Cash and real estate, gold and silver jewelry, luxury cars and watches, antique calligraphy and paintings, there is always something suitable for fallen officials, which is also a common feature of corruption among male and female officials. However, the difference in preferences between male and female officials in the form of corruption is also a visible phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, the ostentatious culture of men showing off their success also had an impact on the officialdom. There were many incidents where people were arrested for corruption based on photos. In view of this, in recent years, the corruption of male officials has mostly been &quot;low-key&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot;, which is the &quot;lesson&quot; learned from certain &quot;cousins&quot; and &quot;brothers&quot; who were dismissed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, in terms of forms of corruption, the &quot;indirect&quot; and &quot;confusing&quot; characteristics of male officials are becoming more and more obvious, such as &quot;setting up offshore accounts&quot;, &quot;accepting bribes after retirement&quot;, &quot;shadow companies&quot;, &quot;option corruption&quot;, etc. There are endless means. The ancient &quot;elegant bribery&quot; has not completely gone into history. The high-end bribery and acceptance of bribes with the help of antique calligraphy and painting are still common in the corruption details of fallen male officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, male officials are also trying to hide their wealth and keep a low profile. They are no longer easily caught because of their public image as usual. Regarding the details of corruption, male officials also try their best to cover up and leave no traceable information, such as the &quot;$300,000 gift box&quot; codenamed &quot;Little Seafood&quot; received by Sun Lijun, and Zhang Qi, former member of the Standing Committee of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee and former Secretary of the Haikou Municipal Party Committee. The secret method of &quot;filling the home with 13.5 tons of gold bars&quot;. Male officials can often use their special interests and hobbies to satisfy their greed while hiding the fact of corruption: Yang Hongwei, former deputy secretary of the party group and deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal Administration for Market Regulation, is known as the &quot;ball secretary&quot; and is keen on playing basketball during working hours. , using playing ball to cover up his corrupt behavior of giving and receiving privately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that playing ball and other hobbies are more common among men. Judging from some female officials who have been dismissed in recent years, corruption that combines power and the love of beauty is not uncommon. From accessories, clothing and bags to luxury goods consumption, to the so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot;. Just like the corruption record of Bai Hong, the former chairman of the labor union of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, &quot;the praise and jealousy of the people around him made Bai Hong immersed in the pleasure of a successful woman.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For bribers to pay for beauty treatments on their behalf, or to give high-priced beauty salon membership cards, this can constitute bribery of female officials, and even the development of novel money laundering methods. In real life, it is not uncommon for &quot;ordinary people to pay exorbitant prices for beauty treatments.&quot; However, once a female official&#39;s love for beauty is empowered by her desire for power, the resulting corruption will become even more like a torrential flood. &quot;Power keeps people young forever&quot; is not only a symbolic statement for female officials, but also a realistic statement that can be realized with the help of beauty consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not just officials who are corrupt. People in key positions can still be corrupt, and corruption tends to be younger. Young people tend to be bolder and more reckless in their corruption. Zhang Yujie, a &quot;post-1995&quot; clerk at the Chuzhou Real Estate Registration Center, embezzled nearly 70 million yuan in public funds, tens of thousands of which were spent on game cards. After the incident, this card was auctioned for more than 80 million yuan. His hobby is playing games. In the 2016 &quot;Accounting Corruption Case of Four Young Women in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province&quot;, Bai Ling, the former cash accountant of the Gaoyou Municipal Agricultural Committee, misappropriated 10.51 million yuan in public funds, of which more than 8 million yuan was used for beauty consumption. At the time of the case, she was only 29 Years old, it is really shocking to embezzle such a huge amount of money just for beauty consumption. Their preference is to love beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 34 of the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on Administrative Punishment for Public Officials&quot; stipulates that &quot;those who accept or provide arrangements for banquets, travel, fitness, entertainment and other activities that may affect the fair exercise of public power will be given a warning, A demerit or a major demerit will be recorded, and if the circumstances are serious, the person will be demoted or dismissed.&quot; Beauty corruption, in terms of form, is a relatively hidden &quot;entertainment and other activities&quot;, and the amount involved is often in compliance with the &quot;Applicable Laws on Handling Criminal Cases of Corruption and Bribery&quot; of the two high authorities. The &quot;extremely huge amount&quot; standard in &quot;Explanation of Certain Issues&quot; can be called hidden corruption in the gray area. Therefore, to combat beauty corruption, we need to start from the source of corruption and curb the room for arbitrary power. This point is gender-neutral. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家数据局揭牌，年内落马中管干部达39人丨时政周报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259490]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/26cYbymIzOStR24cc3LlYF4O4UW02DgWUpAEzt6F.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;617&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/26cYbymIzOStR24cc3LlYF4O4UW0 2DgWUpAEzt6F. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255790&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 25, 2023, the National Data Administration was officially launched. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than seven months of preparation, on the morning of October 25, 2023, a group of members of the preparatory team Witnessed by representatives from other ministries and commissions, the National Data Agency was officially unveiled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the two newly established departments in the ninth institutional reform of the State Council have been completed. Previously, the newly established State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau had completed its listing on May 18, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new round of institutional reform plan of the State Council shows that the National Data Administration is managed by the National Development and Reform Commission and is specifically responsible for coordinating and promoting the construction of data infrastructure systems, coordinating the integration, sharing and development and utilization of data resources, and coordinating the promotion of digital China, digital economy, Digital society planning and construction, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Exploring the Blue Ocean of Data&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before the National Data Bureau announced its establishment, the importance of data had been emphasized many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, the &quot;Overall Layout Plan for the Construction of Digital China&quot; was issued. Earlier, at the end of 2022, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Building a Data Infrastructure System to Better Play the Role of Data Elements.&quot; Both documents include content to accelerate the development of the digital economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiandong, deputy director of the Price Monitoring Center of the National Development and Reform Commission, was more direct. In an exclusive interview with the media in April 2023, he once proposed that by the end of the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; period, the size of China&#39;s data element circulation market will reach one trillion yuan, which is a huge blue ocean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Existing data has confirmed this statement. The &quot;Digital China Development Report (2022)&quot; released by the Cyberspace Administration of China shows that the scale of China&#39;s data digital economy will reach 50.2 trillion yuan in 2022, ranking second in the world, accounting for 41.5% of GDP, and will continue to remain the same. With a high growth rate of 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to Zhang Xianghong, a professor at the International Research Center for Information Management Theory and Technology at Beijing Jiaotong University, the current level of development of China&#39;s public data, corporate data and personal data is still low, and the level of utilization is not high. Problems of insufficient motivation and insufficient utilization of vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, unified data resource management and activation of data efficiency have become high hopes for the National Data Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a previous interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend, Yuan Lizhi, a partner at Jingtian &amp; Gongcheng Law Firm and an expert in data law, mentioned that in January 2023, after a seminar on the circulation of data elements, the state Staff from the National Development and Reform Commission once worked with him to communicate on practical issues regarding the circulation of data elements. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two leaders made their early appearance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;They have clear development goals, which is also reflected in the personnel arrangements of the National Data Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 18, 2023, Liu Liehong, the first director of the National Data Administration, made his first public appearance at the high-level forum on digital economy of the third &quot;Belt and Road&quot; International Cooperation Summit Forum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The resume shows that Liu Liehong was born in 1968 and has worked in industrial electronic information institutions for a long time.

title=&quot;硬核军训是怎么炼成的&quot;>;硬核军训是怎么炼成的&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;采访桂林电子科技大学（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;下称“桂电”&lt;/span>;）和桂林航天工业学院（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;下称“桂航”&lt;/span>;）军训负责人员时，我想了解组织硬核军训的难处，却总是未能如愿。这两所学校借到模拟武器、战车，并不很费力。摸爬滚打的战术训练，似乎也是水到渠成。当地警备区、军训教育基地，不吝于向校方开放大门，能把拟真的装备、足够数量的现役或退役军人输送到参训新生身边。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在这些客观因素之外，我感受到，有一股强烈的心灵力量，让广西这两所高校的硬核军训得以顺畅推行。在参加特战训练的学生心中，军训不是一项强迫完成的义务，而是被渴慕的生命体验。一种人，从军训第一天起就期盼着一切结束那天的解脱感；另一种人，则希望追求军训的内在价值，即使军训结束，也渴望将其延续。我自认为，学生时代参加军训时，我属于前者；但桂林高校的参训学生，有很多属于后者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沈鸿受访时，有些腼腆。爱国国防教育协会主席黄翊龙常说，沈鸿是红军排雷炮手的优秀代表。听到这类赞扬，沈鸿或埋头看地，或遥望路灯，刻意向我藏起笑意。与偶尔飘忽的神情不同，即便人已经出列，二十多分钟内，沈鸿的模拟枪从头至尾都被他以标准的持枪姿势定在胸口，不曾移动分毫。两周新生军训、两周协会的日常训练，似乎让他把坚如磐石的动作刻成了习惯。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;提到特战训练的艰辛，沈鸿总是轻描淡写：“手肘、膝盖、腿、脚都有擦伤，但敷点药就过去了。”“跃进时突然听到左右遇敌的指令，身体反应不过来，这个动作就一直练，加强练。开始会做错，练三四天我能做标准。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比起这些，“军人”的身份对沈鸿更有感召力。他出生于广西环江毛南族自治县，今年刚大一，已经追了十多年战争片、谍战剧。回忆起和父亲一起看电视的时光，沈鸿的语调提高了几度，“中国军人很帅气。”他第一次知道身为农民的父亲还当过兵，是因为看到了他的行军水壶，“那是军队里特有的水壶。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沈鸿确信，如果自身条件符合征兵标准，他毕业后定会入伍。对他而言，这次军训，不只是按教学大纲上的必修课程，更是正式从军前严肃的预备演练。吸引他加入战术连队的，不只有形式丰富的枪械训练，还有随压力而来的“军人的自豪感。”在沈鸿眼中，队友也是“家国意识强烈，说话直接又豪爽的人”。 “我喜欢和这样能够推心置腹的人做朋友。”他渴望未来的军营生活也是如此：在草地训练时被蚂蚁咬，有战友会乐呵呵地递上一剂药膏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月28日，桂航军训汇演结束时天色已暗，没有机会在汇演中乘坐装甲车的特战队员以八九人为一批，挨个爬上装甲车。他们在车顶勾肩搭背坐成小半圈，一边唱着歌，一边随战车向前挺进。每个人的脸上都挂着疲惫的迷彩妆，歌声却依然嘹亮，他们就像久经沙场的战士们，凯旋而归。行进到操场中央，装甲车猛然停下，队员们一个趔趄，仿佛也是梦醒于此。但当他们从车上爬下来，又看到远处其他队员盘腿坐在路灯下，吵吵嚷嚷，热热闹闹，便奔了过去，战友的微信、照片、言语，长存于迷彩色的梦境之后。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;母亲告诉我，杨奶奶今年81岁，是村里年龄最大的人。杨奶奶的老伴过世多年，她的两个儿子都在省城武汉发展，她独居。我见地里种有白萝卜、胡萝卜、红菜苔、卷心菜，便问杨奶奶为何要种这么多，她说，“四个月后，孩子们都回家了，一起有9张嘴。”我一下子意识到，四个月后就是春节。她还补充了一句，“不仅他们过年回来吃，我还得备一些给他们走的时候带走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看到早些时候种下的萝卜长势不是很好，我问她何故，她告诉两点原因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，很多农民进城打工了，很多田地荒芜了，灌木丛到处都是，野猪、獾子等动物较之从前多了许多，像人多势众一样，它们已经不是夜里偷偷摸摸地吃包括蔬菜在内的农作物，大白天它们也可以大大方方地入侵菜地、谷地、红薯地，白天，老人还能时不时杵着一根棍子过来菜地看守，驱赶一下野物，夜里，她就完全没有办法了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，因为长期使用农药及化肥，农地的土壤结构发生了变异，土壤板结严重，肥力下降得厉害，包括蔬菜在内的各类农作物的产量锐减。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;事实上，我们回不去了&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;叮嘱杨奶奶小心一些后，我和母亲继续散步。眼前是大片的稻田，母亲问我知道哪块是我家的，我猜了两次，母亲皆摇摇头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我顿觉惭愧，我连自家的田地都不知在哪里。应该是2008年工作以来，每次我回家，父母都不怎么下地干农活，专门陪着我，我当然也鲜有机会下地。时间久了，我也就忘了家里田地的准确位置。见稻谷呈金黄色，我提议第二天收割，我也帮忙割，不料母亲对我的割稻技艺很不放心。 “还是等你回广州了，我和你爸慢慢来吧，你多年不下田，万一割到手，就不好了。”我竟然无言以对，因为事实就是我虽然经常回家，但很少下地干活，早已不像我念小学和初中那会儿，是家里重要的劳力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在广州某高校任职，我有为期不短的暑假及寒假，我每年回家的天数远多于村里其他年轻人。譬如我弟，他17岁高二辍学后就开始了他的打工生涯，基本上一年到头都在外打工，除了春节回家半月左右。我弟今年44岁，迄今打工了27年。如今，他已在武汉购房，弟媳及两个侄子也都在武汉常住，大侄子念大学，弟媳照顾上小学的小侄子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，我的小家一家四口在广州，我弟的小家一家四口在武汉，我们都主动或被动地卷入了城镇化的浪潮，我们很难再回到家乡发展或定居了。事实上，我们也回不去了，因为我们早已不是“农业人口”了，我们一直在从事“非农产业”，与我弟的户籍至今在老家无关。不管我们是不是享受到了地道广州或武汉市民的各类福利或待遇，我们都已经是名副其实的（新）广州人或（新）武汉人，广州或武汉是我们的常住地，是我们及孩子们吃喝拉撒、衣食住行的地儿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我和我弟是70后，村里比我们年幼的80后、90后干嘛呢？现在何处？少部分人依靠读书离开了家乡，绝大部分像我弟一样常年在外打工，他们的共同点是常年不在家，不回家，有且只有过年才回家待上十天半月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比我们年长的60后又在干嘛呢？我所在的村有8位60后，其中4位随子女进城务工，要么照顾上学的孙子，要么给做建筑工的儿子打打下手，有两位开了装修公司，分别在武汉和西宁做起了老板，最后两个都在教育行业，一位在武汉某大学做老师，另外一位在家乡的村小学做校长。不难看出，8位60后也基本上都脱离了农村及农业，也都是逢过年才回家的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;60后、70后、80后、90后现在都进城了，目前都在城里打拼，他们未来有回村的计划或迹象吗？我感觉微乎其微。他们在城里多年，饮食、文化、习惯等早已高度城市化了，80后及90后，他们经历了城市化的漂洗，商场、KTV、影院，快餐、游戏厅，他们已经离不开这些东西了，就连1962出生的夏叔也说，“我虽然在老家种了20多年的地，但现在我已经不习惯回家了，因为老家的生活太不方便了，城市太方便了。”在东北打工的文哥也曾提过，“家里的冬天太冷了，我很不适应，我在哈尔滨待了32年，那里虽然室外温度低，但室内都有暖气，很舒服。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;务农人Vs农民&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;不言而喻，至今都在老家务农的人只剩下杨奶奶这种40后，及像我父母一样的50后。随着孩子纷纷进城上学，很多妇女也加入了打工族，以及上世纪80年代改革开放初期就外出谋生的60后对城市生活的极大适应，往昔作为农村人口主要构成主体的“386199”部队，如今只剩下了孤独的“99”，对应的具体群体当是40后及50后。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想表达，这群人是名副其实的“最后一代务农人”。特别指出，笔者并未使用“农民”这一概念。在我看来，“农民”“工人”等概念具有鲜明的政治与身份属性，“农民”一词使用语境里，经常存在若干对照群体，比如“农民对应哪个群体”“农民在农村，工人在城里”，其实不然，本质上，他们只是行业或职业分工的差异而已，不存在政治、身份等方面的分野或对立。同样，“工人”一词也存在类似情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时过境迁，我们更愿意使用“打工人”“打工仔”“打工妹”“务农人”“农民工”等普通百姓耳熟能详与更容易接受的概念。不管是“务农人”，还是“打工人”，他们都是名副其实的产业工人（industrial workers/laborers）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;务农人的技艺&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;既是“务农人”，这群高龄老人自然深谙务农或农村与农业的各项技术与技艺，他们打小对农业时令了如指掌，知道啥时候春耕，啥时候育苗，啥时候播种，啥时候施肥，啥时候除草，啥时候收割，用什么储藏农作物。他们知道拿灶膛或柴火堆里的灰烬作为肥料，也知道用人及鸡、猪等粪便作为农作物养料的重要补充，而不只是全部倚靠农药或化肥来提高土壤的肥力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们会利用房前屋后的边角地种一点菜，或开垦山间布满石块或荒芜已久的闲置或废弃地种东西。建房子或选坟地前，他们会请风水先生看看；他们发明了夏天纳凉用的竹床、冬天取暖用的烘笼，夜里如厕用的夜壶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们中的很多人打小就是标准的农村匠人，如铁匠、漆匠、油匠、木匠、篾匠、裁缝、接生婆、赤脚医生、算命先生、巫医。村里改造时，他们提醒年轻人不要轻易移除村口的古木，强烈建议保留村中央的老祠堂。家人肚子疼、腹泻或有其他三病两痛时，他们会去田里寻来鱼腥草、艾叶，用来泡脚、泡澡，或烟熏，或煎水服用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毫不夸张地说，他们熟悉或掌握的技艺，不胜枚举。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然，他们中的绝大部分人文化程度很低，文盲或半文盲的比例甚高，但无碍于他们对农业技术、乡村记忆与农业文明的深谙与熟稔。对于教科书或宣传标语里的循环经济、生态农业、集约与节约用地、非物质文化遗产等，他们或许不曾说过，也不懂怎么表达，但他们却一辈子在践行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这道出了一个理儿，文化、文明经常或通常与文化程度关系不大，或不太大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如实说，“最后一代务农人”对农业技术的传承、农业文明的赓续、家庭与家族的和谐、国家的城镇化与现代化作出了重大贡献。正是他们接续其先人与祖先，通过一代又一代人的传承，才令到农业文明得以发扬与传承；正是他们镇守老家与后方，才让其子女及其晚辈可以从容与放心地进城打拼，创造属于新一代人的新生活；正是他们及其子女的善良与拼搏，才缔造了中国低成本的工业化、城镇化与现代化奇迹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;务农人的生活方式与价值观&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;于生活方式而言，“最后一代务农人”普遍具有勤俭节约的品格，比如吃东西尽量不浪费，做多少吃多少，人吃剩了的给猪狗鸡等家畜家禽吃，对子女出于孝顺与孝敬心的各种快递，他们虽倍感欣慰，但也偶有抱怨，会觉得子女花钱如流水，大手大脚。勤俭节约品格的习得与养成，固然与他们历经的那些至艰至难岁月有关，但在那个物质极度贫乏的年代，不节约、不节俭，就没有办法实现物质与财富积累，及资本积累。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里的“资本积累”，不妨理解为“没有钱，交不起学费，孩子即便考上大学了也上不了大学，作为农村人最大的宏愿——&#39;跳出农门&#39;，以及日后的门庭显赫、光宗耀祖，自然也都无法兑现”。上述说法的假设是：子女是家里最重要的投资领域，对子女的培养支出就是投资成本，子女日后的发展及回报就是投资收益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;价值观念方面，“最后一代务农人”非常“忘我”，“忘我”到极致。他们生命的全部意义在于贡献与奉献，很多人大半辈子或一辈子都在为别人活、为家人活。他们历经千辛万苦，一辈子被固着在土地上，没有或鲜有离开家乡，干了一辈子农活，所谓“面朝黄土背朝天”的精准所指就是他们这一代人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们中的很多人打小就是家里的主要劳力，勤俭节省一辈子，盖房子，娶妻生子，然后节衣缩食抚养孩子成人，供孩子读书，待到孩子大了，还想着给孩子补贴一下，多少分担一下孩子在城里购房或结婚成家的压力。少部分人甚至忍受文化适应的煎熬，在耄耋之年依然选择进城给孩子做饭、接送孙子上学及放学，待到孙辈大了，他们才得以回家，回到他们习惯了一辈子的家。回家了，他们终于可以不用忙碌了，却发现早已落下一身病，有的人选择不告诉子女，怕用子女的钱，有的人干脆不去医院体检，担心一旦查出问题，给子女添堵。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;既然是“最后一代务农人”，那就是“末代”了，就如同很多已经和正在经历衰败与凋敝过程的村庄一样，时代的洪流不会因为他们辛苦或艰难就可怜他们，或留住他们。旧人退场，新人登场，从来就是历史发展与演迁之必然规律，没有人可以阻止。我们可以心生凄凉，但终究还需释怀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;
