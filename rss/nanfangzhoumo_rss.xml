The official account of the School of History and Culture of Central China Normal University published a promotional article, which published a student&#39;s reflections when participating in military training. &quot;During the interview, he used &quot;The Book of Songs·Beyond the Sun&quot; to express his feelings.&quot; The full text was immediately published. I wrote this poem &quot;The Book of Songs·Beyond the Sun&quot;: &quot;If the sun comes, the eastern sun rises. The crimson mist covers it, like silk curtains. The sun is green, the mist is rippling. The red stone winter stream is like an agate pond. . The sun is setting in the evening, and warm dreams are like joy. I swim in the floating bath, like a pheasant flying.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the article was published, it triggered hilarious ridicule across the Internet: The so-called &quot;Book of Songs·Beyond the Sun&quot; is simply not It does not exist. This poem is simply a forgery written by modern people and has been circulated on the Internet for a long time. The interviewed students &quot;quoted&quot; the song &quot;Bi Yang&quot; with the intention of complaining about it as a &quot;homonym&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the public opinion fermented, the official account of the School of History and Culture of Central China Normal University quickly deleted the article. On September 19, the college stated in the &quot;Situation Statement&quot; that &quot;the control was not strict and a tweet caused a negative impact, and we deeply apologize&quot;, &quot;the college has conducted a profound review and has criticized and educated relevant personnel&quot; and will &quot;in-depth &quot;Problem rectification&quot;, &quot;drawing inferences from one example&quot;, &quot;strengthening student education guidance&quot; and &quot;strengthening public account management&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While making people laugh, this incident also raises a question, that is, the inner mechanism and past and present life of such &quot;pseudo-poetry and pseudo-essays&quot;: why do they appear, and how do they become popular? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, pseudo-poems and pseudo-texts have appeared since the beginning of the Internet, and have been &quot;carried forward&quot; in the new media era. For example, the song mentioned by Han Han in the novel &quot;Three Gates&quot; &quot;I can smell the flowers when I lie down, I know how to paint the sky. The fish kisses the water on the stone, and the stone answers the spring green&quot;, which has caused a lot of jokes and many &quot;adaptations&quot; &quot;Re-creation&quot;, the person who forwarded it inadvertently hit the target. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Originated from the Internet, the author is unknown” is often a major feature of these pseudo-poems and pseudo-articles. Most pseudo-poems and pseudo-texts are spread quickly on the Internet, and the author cannot be found at all. The reason is also very simple, because these &quot;poems&quot; were originally written by pretending to be based on the ancients, and the real author naturally had to hide his identity. The natural &quot;anonymity&quot; at the beginning of the Internet was the natural soil for pseudo-poems and pseudo-texts to flourish. The Internet has given birth to a large number of pseudo-poems and pseudo-articles, and pseudo-poems and pseudo-articles have also been widely spread due to the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It spreads like wildfire without realizing it is fake. This is another major characteristic of fake poems and fake prose. In particular, fake poems and fake articles can inadvertently deceive highly educated people into confusion. In the &quot;Warring States Policy&quot; incident in 2009, a doctor in Shanghai blurted out during an interview, &quot;&#39;What the hell? The word &quot;comes from &quot;Warring States Policy&quot; and describes those who show off their appearance and seize fame and status,&quot; which also caused an uproar on the Internet. In fact, the so-called &quot;&quot;Warring States Policy·Chu Ce&quot;&quot; from which this sentence comes is purely a joke made by netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having existed since ancient times, pseudo-poems and pseudo-texts write about real things at this moment, but they must be deliberately wrapped in a layer of classical Chinese, with homophony, puns, anonymity, and hidden meanings. The final rhetorical method is completed. In other words, although the object of its projection is contemporary, its grammar and rhetoric are &quot;ancient&quot; to the letter, and its &quot;pseudo-submission technique&quot; is a technique that the ancients have long used. &quot;The Book of Songs: Biyang&quot; is also in line with the true meaning of the &quot;Book of Songs&quot; in terms of effect, &quot;The Book of Songs can be used to inspire, to observe, to group, and to complain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the famous &quot;Full Score Essay on the College Entrance Examination&quot; &quot;The Death of Red Rabbit&quot;, the author cleverly uses the &quot;character design&quot; of &quot;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; to describe the great meaning of &quot;integrity&quot;, which is essentially an essay. It is an excellent &quot;pseudo-poem and pseudo-article&quot;, and its technique of fake substantiation is undoubtedly much better than the above-mentioned cases. There is even an allusion made up by Su Shi: &quot;Gaotao is a scholar, and he will kill people. Gao Tao said to kill three, Yao said to forgive him. The charm of &quot;three&quot;: There is no such allusion in ancient times, but Su Shi&#39;s fabrication is undoubtedly in line with Yao&#39;s &quot;personality&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pseudo-poetry and pseudo-articles became popular due to the boom of the Internet, but they will eventually be destined to decline due to technological iteration. For example, there are endless fake poems by Li Bai on the Internet. There are many well-known literature professors in the society who personally identify the poems based on the level and rhyme. There are also many netizens who &quot;look through the complete works of Li Taibai&quot; to verify the authenticity; &quot;Warring States Policy&quot; Incident&quot; also alerted literature professors to falsify this false article. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, various large language models have emerged. The powerful computing power of artificial intelligence can not only produce pseudo-poems and pseudo-texts on a large scale, but also easily crawl ancient documents and identify authentic texts. Fake. &quot;The Book of Songs: Biyang&quot; has been circulating for many years, and senior netizens have also developed the ability to identify fakes at a glance. This time the editor of the public account was deceived into a fog. He can only say that his own network &quot;rank&quot; needs to be improved, and he did not make good use of the rich network resources to do the identification work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Shishuo Xinyu·Pai Diao&quot; records, &quot;Xi Chizhi and Sun Xinggong were not acquainted, so they sat together with Duke Huan. Huan said to Sun: &#39;We can talk to Xi in the army.&#39; Sun Yun: &#39;Stupid You, a barbarian Jing, dare to enmity with a big country?&#39; Xi Yun said: &#39;Severely cutting down the yong and yellow, as for Taiyuan.&#39;&quot; Sun Chuo mocked Xi Chuo Chi for being a &quot;barbarian Jing&quot; who was born in the Chu region, and Xi Chuo retorted that his native place was In Taiyuan, a place where the Huns were infested, two people here each quoted a poem from &quot;The Book of Songs·Xiaoya&quot;, which was just right and clever, which shows the eternal charm of the &quot;Book of Songs&quot;. After all, pseudo-poems and pseudo-texts will no longer be as easy for people to take the bait as before, but the cultural interest derived from classical poetry will continue, whether it is a simple homophonic curse, or a higher-level &quot;playing with poetry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[20家银行净利占A股1/3强，“利润王”对抗息差压力分化加剧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257314]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Major commercial banks, the “profit kings” of China’s A-share market, are facing unprecedented profit pressure because overall interest rates The gap has fallen to historic lows. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the People&#39;s Bank of China will implement the second reserve requirement ratio cut in 2023 starting from September 15, 2023, which has eased the liability costs of commercial banks to a certain extent, and the previous two asymmetric interest rate cuts have also moderately protected businesses. The interest rate spread of banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the central bank&#39;s protective mentality, under the complex and special economic situation in 2023, the profitability of commercial banks is being tested. Which banks are more resilient? Which banks are under pressure? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the 2023 mid-term reports of commercial banks, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center analyzed the 20 major domestic banks with assets of 2 trillion yuan and above (18 of which were rated as domestic banks in 2022). Systemically important banks) conduct vertical and horizontal comparative studies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This research refers to 20 large domestic commercial banks (referred to as &quot;20 banks&quot; in this article), including 6 major state-owned commercial banks (Industrial, Agricultural, China, Construction, Communications, and Postal Savings Bank), 9 national joint-stock commercial banks (China Merchants, Industrial Bank, CITIC, Everbright, Pudong Development Bank, Ping An, Huaxia, Minsheng, Zheshang) and 5 city commercial banks (Bank of Beijing, Bank of Ningbo, Bank of Shanghai, Bank of Jiangsu, Bank of Nanjing), Their asset scale exceeds 2 trillion yuan. (Since it did not disclose its semi-annual report, China Guangfa Bank was not included in this statistical analysis.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the above comparative research, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also surveyed the research teams of large domestic securities firms and banks, and Combined with each bank&#39;s interim results press conference (including both media press conferences and investor exchange meetings), an in-depth analysis of changes in the core operating indicators of the above banks was conducted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The study found that against the background of prudent but loose monetary policy in the first half of the year, the overall revenue of the 20 major banks fell by 3.9% year-on-year, and individual banks faced capital pressure. From the perspective of influencing factors, the narrowing of interest spreads is the main drag, but the margin of decline in net interest margins has narrowed. However, the net profits of 20 banks increased by 3.3% year-on-year, mainly due to the decline in non-performing ratios and provisions that fed back profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the three echelons of state-owned banks, joint-stock banks and city commercial banks, the competitiveness of each bank against the cycle has shown obvious differentiation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Scale and provisions&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;VS&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Interest spread&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Net profit of city commercial banks increased The fastest&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center counted the mid-term report data of 20 banks and learned that in the first half of 2023, the operating income of the 20 banks totaled 2.92 trillion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 3.8% , but net profit rose instead of falling, with net profit attributable to the parent company reaching 1.03 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 2.9%. The total net profit attributable to parent companies of all companies in the A-share market during the same period was 2.95 trillion, and the net profits of 20 banks accounted for more than one-third of the net profits of all listed companies in the A-share market. They can be described as the &quot;profit kings&quot; in the true sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/h6rabkaDOJa8s94SO41VwKdKJeAyVlPlmwxcY0mw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;577&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/h6rabkaDOJa8s94SO41VwKdKJeAyVlPlmwxcY0mw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251553&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of scale, state-owned banks have an absolute advantage. In the first half of the year, the average revenue of the six major state-owned banks was about 307.8 billion yuan, and the average net profit attributable to the parent company was 115 billion yuan; the average revenue of the nine joint-stock banks was 89.4 billion yuan, and the average net profit attributable to the parent company was 30 billion yuan; the average operating income of the five city commercial banks Revenue was 31 billion yuan, with an average net profit attributable to the parent company of 13.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;State-owned banks, joint-stock banks and city commercial banks all show an obvious trend of differentiation. For example, among the state-owned banks, the net profit of ICBC was 174.720 billion, while that of Bank of Communications was 46.555 billion; among the joint-stock banks, the net profit of China Merchants Bank was 76.437 billion, while that of Zheshang Bank was 7.965 billion; among the city commercial banks, the net profit of Bank of Jiangsu was as high as 17.626 billion, exceeding Many joint-stock companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of growth rate alone, city commercial banks performed better. In the first half of the year, the revenue of the five city commercial banks increased by 3.4% year-on-year, and the net profit attributable to the parent company increased by 10.9% year-on-year. However, the revenue of the six major state-owned banks and nine joint-stock banks declined year-on-year, while profits increased slightly year-on-year. Among them, the revenue of the six major state-owned banks decreased by 4.8% year-on-year, and the net profit attributable to the parent company increased by 2.5% year-on-year; the revenue of 9 joint-stock banks decreased by 2.7% year-on-year, and the net profit attributable to the parent company increased by 2.0% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center surveyed the research teams of major securities firms and banks and found that in terms of factors affecting performance, scale is the main driving force, followed by provisions, and interest spreads are the main drag, followed by is the cost. According to calculations by CITIC Securities, growth in scale has contributed positively to net profit by 12.2%, and provision and other non-interest have contributed positively to net profit by 4.4% and 2.2% respectively; while narrowing of interest spreads and increasing operating expenses are the main drags. items, dragging down profits by 13.2% and 2.5% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of particular note is Bank of Jiangsu. The bank&#39;s net profit attributable to the parent company in the first half of 2023 increased by 27.2% year-on-year, and revenue growth reached 10.6%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/2g1Shb7xfx5xkjvO84lmRoEouIspBIYAzur2KeL0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;667&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/2g1Shb7xfx5xkjvO84lmRoEouIspBIYAzur2KeL0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251549&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is in line with Jiangsu Bank’s focus on small and micro business operations strategy is closely related. The bank&#39;s interim report showed that the balance of small and micro loans was 625 billion yuan, accounting for 35.80% of total loans. At the same time, the non-performing loan ratio of Bank of Jiangsu was 0.91%, a decrease of 0.03 percentage points from the end of the previous year; the provision coverage ratio was 378.09%, an increase of 6.43 percentage points from the end of the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why can Bank of Jiangsu maintain a declining NPL ratio while growing rapidly? From an internal perspective, firstly, Bank of Jiangsu attaches great importance to financial technology and proposes the strategy of building “the bank with the most Internet big data genes”, with the president also serving as the chief information officer. Second, the channel outlets are widely distributed. Bank of Jiangsu has 460 business outlets spread across counties in Jiangsu Province and is familiar with the local economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the external ecosystem, Jiangsu’s strong private economy is the foundation for the bank’s development. As of the end of 2022, there were a total of 13.608 million private enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households in Jiangsu Province, accounting for 96.4% of the province&#39;s business entities. In 2022, the added value of the province&#39;s private economy will reach 7.1 trillion yuan, accounting for 57.7% of Jiangsu Province&#39;s GDP, and its contribution to the province&#39;s GDP growth will increase from 63.1% in the previous year to 72.2%. This can also be confirmed in the &quot;Suzhou Financial Ecosystem In-depth Survey&quot; series by the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The expansion of commercial banks is often accompanied by capital consumption. Researchers at the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that, overall, the core tier one capital adequacy ratio of commercial banks is still relatively high, but a few banks are facing certain capital pressure. For example, joint-stock banks CITIC, Hua Xia and Zheshang Bank have their core tier 1 capital adequacy ratio approaching the regulatory red line. However, according to the &lt;span>;China Securities Regulatory Commission&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&#39;s recently released &quot;Rescue&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; Combination Punch&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>; the China Securities Regulatory Commission Recently, they have been cautious about financing from commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The proportion of corporate loans has increased&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Business loans have become new&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Personal loans&lt;/strong>; strong>;&lt;strong>;Increase&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Main force&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The deposit and loan business is the basic business of the bank, and the expansion of the asset balance sheet is the core business of the bank. important growth strategy. In the first half of 2023, the total assets of the 20 banks were 260.04 trillion, a year-on-year increase of 11.9%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/RyZrGgDlIodsSjTWd8XENxoij9sZk8IT0zjwnKvY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;656&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/RyZrGgDlIodsSjTWd8XENxoij9sZk8IT0zjwnKvY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251550&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of asset structure, the six major state-owned banks as a whole Relatively stable; 9 joint-stock banks have increased their financial investment proportions, slightly decreased loans, and differentiated assets among peers; 5 city commercial banks have relatively large differences. The proportion of assets of Bank of Ningbo and Bank of Nanjing increased by 1.95% and 1.39% respectively year-on-year. The proportion of financial investment of Bank of Beijing increased by 5.4% year-on-year. The proportion of deposits from banks of Shanghai Bank increased by 28.8% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the loan structure, the proportion of retail loans has declined while the proportion of corporate loans has increased. In the first half of 2023, the corporate loans of the 20 banks accounted for 57.89%, a year-on-year increase of 3.8%, and the retail loans accounted for 37.60%, a year-on-year decrease of 6.0%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that the main reason is that driven by policies, credit demand for large infrastructure and core manufacturing industries is the first to recover, while retail loans are dragged down by residents’ income levels and consumption willingness, and effective demand not tall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among retail loans, the proportion of mortgage loans decreased, and operating loans became the main source of loan growth. Judging from the banks that disclosed operating loan data, in the first half of 2023, among state-owned banks, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Bank of Communications increased by 98.2%, 44.8% and 39.1% respectively year-on-year; among joint-stock banks, Industrial Bank increased by 26.4% year-on-year; city commercial banks Among them, Bank of Shanghai and Bank of Jiangsu increased by 60.8% and 53.7% respectively year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The low interest rate of operating loans is one of the reasons for its rapid growth. Whether business loans are diverted to other uses in violation of regulations has always attracted much attention. The Central Bank and the State Administration of Financial Supervision jointly issued the &quot;Notice on Adjusting and Optimizing Differentiated Housing Credit Policies&quot; and &quot;Notice on Matters Related to Reducing the Interest Rates of Existing First Home Loans&quot; jointly issued on August 31. &quot;It can also reduce the space for illegal use of business loans and consumer loans to replace existing housing loans.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the current operating loan interest rate is still lower than the housing loan interest rate, and borrowers still have room for replacement. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Term deposits will continue&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;International competitiveness needs to be improved&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In high-quality assets In less cases, banks have an urgent and realistic task of managing liability costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparative research by the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that the regularization of liability-side deposits continues, mainly due to the increase in the proportion of regular personal deposits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2023, corporate time deposits among the 20 major banks have diverged. In terms of growth rate, Agricultural Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank grew faster. However, the proportion of personal time deposits has generally increased. Among them, Industrial Bank had the largest year-on-year increase, reaching 45.4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/kmKuJtGFXhLoifcQne7694knOWVsg7jXlc1s8rSS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;656&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/kmKuJtGFXhLoifcQne7694knOWVsg7jXlc1s8rSS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251554&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers at the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believe that in the short term Judging from the above, the expansion of bank asset balance sheets is related to the prudent and loose monetary policy in the first half of the year. Measures to stabilize growth continued to be introduced, and the real economic sector began to increase leverage. Data show that the leverage ratio has increased significantly by 10.8pcts from the end of 2022, and commercial banks have overall accelerated their balance sheet expansion. But in the long term, China&#39;s banking industry needs to improve its income structure. Compared with overseas, the revenue of China&#39;s banking industry is mainly realized by the expansion of asset business, and the proportion of non-interest income of light capital is still not high. China&#39;s banking industry needs to further strengthen its product innovation, talent training and business development capabilities in financial markets, wealth management, investment banking, transaction banking, etc., further enhance the level of non-interest business income generation, and increase return on capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Large banks also need to improve their international business capabilities. Take ICBC as an example. The financial report shows that ICBC has ranked first among the top 1000 global banks in the British &quot;The Banker&quot; list for eleven consecutive years, ranked first among the global commercial banks in the U.S. Fortune 500 list for eleven consecutive years, and ranked first in the British Brand Finance list for seven consecutive years. Ranked first among the top 500 most valuable global bank brands. However, ICBC mainly relies on the support of the domestic business market, and its degree of internationalization and international business competitiveness lag behind the top-ranked large European, American and Japanese banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that as of the end of June, ICBC had established 415 overseas institutions in 49 countries and regions. However, the total assets of ICBC’s overseas institutions only account for 7.3% of the group’s total assets. Among them, assets in Hong Kong and Macao accounted for 46.41% of the assets of overseas institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The decline in net interest margin narrowed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Under the double attack of the scarcity of high-quality assets and the regularization of deposits, bank interest margins fell to a record low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research by the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that in the first half of 2023, among the 20 banks, Agricultural Bank of China had the largest year-on-year decrease in interest margins, a decrease of 36BP, while Bank of Nanjing had the smallest decrease, with a decrease of only 2BP. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/5xSlElZOjPJajX05FgPbOhhrSycH1ooUOr7BvJqs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;583&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/5xSlElZOjPJajX05FgPbOhhrSycH1ooUOr7BvJqs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251551&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the central bank show that in 2022, China’s commercial banks will The net interest margin was 1.91%, and was even as low as 1.74% in the first half of 2023, which was lower than the baseline for two consecutive quarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the narrowing trend of net interest margin is slowing down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the short term, it mainly benefits from the policy-driven easing of pressure on both assets and liabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The downward pressure on asset-side interest rates is expected to ease. The central bank&#39;s second quarter monetary execution report pointed out that &quot;commercial banks need to maintain reasonable profits and net interest margins to maintain sound operations and prevent financial risks. This will also help enhance the sustainability of commercial banks in supporting the real economy.&quot; Newly issued in the second quarter of 2023 The corporate loan interest rate remained unchanged at 3.95% month-on-month, and the new mortgage interest rate fell slightly by 3 BP to 4.11% month-on-month. The decline has gradually narrowed. On August 31, the existing first-home loan interest rate policy was officially implemented, stipulating that the adjusted home loan interest rate shall not be lower than the lower limit of the first-home loan interest rate policy in the &quot;city where the original loan is issued&quot;. This reflects the central bank&#39;s care for commercial banks&#39; interest rate spreads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bank liability-side costs have also been reduced. On September 1, state-owned banks and most joint-stock banks took the initiative to lower the listed interest rates of RMB deposits for the third time this year. The interest rates for medium and long-term deposits were lowered by a larger margin, which will effectively offset the impact of the lower interest rates on existing first-home mortgages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believe that banks’ setting of net interest margin targets should be reasonably planned within the scope of their own risk preferences, because credit risk preferences have a direct impact on the level of net interest margins of commercial banks. Influence. In the environment of interest rate liberalization and financial disintermediation, the cost of liabilities is relatively rigid. At the same time, the demand for on-balance sheet credit from traditional large corporate customers has shrunk. Banks urgently need to find new credit growth points, such as small business loans, small and micro loans, and consumer loans. wait. Although such loans are priced at a high level, their credit risks are also relatively high. Therefore, banks cannot increase their risk appetite in pursuit of short-term improvement in net interest margin. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The non-performing ratio improved and provisions rebounded&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the interim results conferences or investor exchange meetings of commercial banks, all sectors of society expressed their concerns about the development of real estate companies. There are widespread concerns about the possible increase in non-performing ratios caused by loans and local platform loans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the overall non-performing ratio of banks has improved and the provision coverage ratio has been stable. In the first half of 2023, the non-performing loan ratios of 20 banks have almost all dropped, and only Ping An Bank’s non-performing loan ratio has increased by 1BP. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The provision coverage ratios of the 20 banks are generally healthy. Only the Postal Savings Bank, Bank of Ningbo and Bank of Shanghai experienced larger year-on-year declines, but the base was still high, which was due to banks taking the initiative to feed back profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/hEBOcg8EYODEm1gDCDMAufgCOiO6z7piSlZLzGPU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;656&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/hEBOcg8EYODEm1gDCDMAufgCOiO6z7piSlZLzGPU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251552&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real estate non-performing rate continues to rise from the beginning of the year. Among them, the average real estate non-performing rate of the six major state-owned banks is 4.46%, the highest among all types of banks; joint-stock banks have the most obvious increase; while city commercial banks are less affected, mainly because they have little involvement in real estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, banks’ demand for index management and balance sheet adjustment through the issuance of non-performing asset securitization products tends to increase. According to Wind statistics, a total of 47 non-performing loan asset-backed securities were issued in the first half of 2023, with a total issuance size of 20.098 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 67.86% and 89.07% respectively. During the same period, the number and scale of credit asset securitization products issued in the inter-bank market were 86 and 153.848 billion yuan respectively, and the proportion of non-performing loan asset-backed securities rose to 54.65% and 13.06% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the decline in non-performing loan ratio is due to active management of banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Middle income&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Continuation&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Negative growth&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Insurance becomes popular&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to interest income, commercial banks have been focusing on non-interest intermediary business income as a strategic focus in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this revenue in the first half of the year was unsatisfactory. The main reason is that residents’ willingness to invest is low. Banks&#39; business income from fund sales and financial management income declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the &quot;China Banking Industry Financial Management Market Semi-Annual Report (First 2023)&quot; released by the Banking Industry Financial Management Registration and Custody Center show that the existing scale of banking industry wealth management products in the first half of 2023 decreased by 2.4 trillion to 25.3 trillion from the beginning of the year. trillion, still in a declining stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of revenue structure, Bank of Communications, China Merchants Bank, Bank of Ningbo and Industrial Bank have a relatively high proportion of non-interest income in revenue, all exceeding 35%. Among them, the non-interest income of Bank of Communications and China Merchants Bank mainly comes from handling fees, while the non-interest income of Industrial Bank and Bank of Ningbo is mainly contributed by investment income from trading assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/NfhzU102CgEo6B3y4VDXZsTj5qGqM3962B5NwVxB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;596&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/NfhzU102CgEo6B3y4VDXZsTj5qGqM3962B5NwVxB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of growth rate, China Merchants Bank’s handling fees and Commission income fell 11.8% year-on-year, but agency insurance income increased 3.07% year-on-year to 9.260 billion yuan. This reflects residents’ tendency to allocate funds in insurance products. Among them, the year-on-year growth in agency insurance income of Industrial Bank and Ping An Bank in the first half of the year was 123.47% and 107.2% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is related to the fact that the incremental whole life insurance with a predetermined interest rate of 3.5% was required to be removed from the shelves at the end of June. Products with high predetermined interest rates are highly attractive under the current circumstances. However, as life insurance products with high predetermined interest rates are removed from the shelves and regulators continue to crack down on bancassurance channel fees, banks&#39; agency insurance fee income in the second half of the year may be lower than in the first half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believe that residents’ asset allocation shows a certain procyclicality. When the prospects of the stock market and real estate market are sluggish or strict supervision suppresses a certain type of existing assets with considerable returns, the scale of residents’ investment in insurance will rise significantly. However, the proportion of real estate in the asset allocation of Chinese households is still relatively high, and financial assets are mainly capital-guaranteed deposits and fixed-income financial products. Judging from the development history of overseas residents&#39; asset allocation, the financial asset allocation structure of domestic residents will be more diversified in the future, and the proportion of asset types such as equity, industrial funds and alternative assets will gradually increase. On the one hand, real estate investment demand will gradually return to rationality; on the other hand, the rigid redemption of financial management is broken, deposit interest rates are reduced, and residents are in urgent need of high-quality financial products. Commercial banks should increase innovation efforts and develop better financial products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[胡安焉：打工人的共鸣与文学的安慰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256785]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;&quot;I Deliver Express in Beijing&quot; is the most watched non-fiction work in 2023. Behind this echo of the times is the process of the author Huan Yan shaping his heart and building his life through writing for more than ten years. When he fell in love with literature, he knew how to spend his life; when he took literature as his ambition, the ups and downs of working could not really hurt him. Fortunately, we still have literature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678020838991949&quot; data-media=&quot;video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;People Weekly 766th issue of Huan Yan video.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/uSgBreF3VnE53aQjdEQyJVP1LWGoEaeZMPJqgmMq.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507 .vod2.myqCloud.com/02F2B5C2VODCQ1251434507/ABF0243F55766780208991949/5nc6t8jbriqa.mp4 &quot;Poster =&quot; Controls &quot;width =&quot; 64 0 &quot;Height =&quot; 360 &quot;>; &lt;Source src =&quot; http: //1251434507.vod2.myqCloud. com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/abf0243f5576678020838991949/5NC6T8jBrIQA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In WeChat Reading, the most tagged passage of &quot;I Deliver Express in Beijing&quot; is as follows: &quot;In short, if despicable people are dissatisfied, they will only bully other despicable people, because resisting power will lead to suffering.

Because they couldn&#39;t afford to offend those who made them angry,&quot; Huan Yan wrote, &quot;and our way and attitude towards them also changed. Almost.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most attractive thing about &quot;I Deliver Express in Beijing&quot; is that in its sincere self-awareness and introspection, it uses a simple and prudent style to show how a person constantly collides with the outside world. Shaping the consciousness and contours of self. He experienced avoidance and cowardice, but in the end he worked hard to move towards a life he considered normal and separated himself from &quot;unreasonable&quot; things. For migrant workers from all walks of life, this book is not a leafy tree, but a seed sown into the heart. Whether blue-collar or white-collar, in a cubicle or on a construction site, there is no essential difference in the feelings between work and freedom, life and self. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huan Yan is introverted. For him, campus life is the happiest time in life. At that time, he had not yet entered society, no one was looking at him, there was no pressure, and there were no complicated relationships. What&#39;s more, his introversion, sensitivity, and shyness didn&#39;t hold him back. Ever since he entered society, he has suffered many setbacks due to his introversion and timidity, but he has been unable to change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He started working in 1999 and moved around. In 2003, he joined a comic club and came into contact with some self-confident non-mainstream values: opposing everything and smashing everything. This conscious and confident act of self-marginalization resolved Huan Yan’s fear of being marginalized by the social system. &quot;They told me that my immature qualities in society are valuable. In fact, they are a process of disenchantment with this society. This &#39;doubt&#39; allowed me to open a door in my numb and drifting life. At least it made me no longer blindly adhere to social standards or mainstream values, and then gradually began to reflect, allowing me to re-examine the value and meaning of all aspects of life: what is important and what is not important.&quot; Huan Yan recalled road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, after working for 10 years, he started writing. Initially, it was to prove the emptiness and ugliness of life with the sublimity of writing, but the childish worry about gains and losses permeated his writing. Two years later, Huan Yan, who fled to writing because of a setback in his life, fled back to life and continued to work because of frustration in his writing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past 20 years, Huan Yan has changed 19 jobs in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Shanghai, Beijing and other places. He has worked as a convenience store clerk, bicycle salesman, logistics picker, courier, etc. . These experiences are often full of frustration and pain, but when he returns to reading or writing - even writing that achieves nothing - he can always find some comfort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He knows that he is a screw, and writing is a creative act that distinguishes him from others. &quot;What I want to write and how to write is a process that is completely controlled by myself.&quot; Huan Yan said, &quot;After a few years, along with reading, thinking, and communicating, I have matured a little. I have gradually seen the &#39;truth&#39; of writing. , I no longer hope to change my life through writing, and I have abandoned the idea of ​​the sublimity of writing. I no longer think that cooking a dish is easier than writing an article.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He did not expect that, Because the article I published on the Internet about the night shift life in Deppon Logistics attracted the attention of literary editors, I did not expect that &quot;I Deliver Express in Beijing&quot; would arouse such a warm response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is like an old-school literary young man: he loves literature, takes literature as his career, is saved by literature, is changed by literature, and meets his life partner through literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;But in fact, outside this writing circle, it is difficult for me to meet the opposite sex who accepts people like me. I don’t know if you understand? My situation is that I am old, have no money, and have very few career prospects. Too bad I&#39;m not willing to work on it yet. Most people wouldn&#39;t consider being with me after hearing my situation.&quot; He said, &quot;Thanks to literature.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999 ;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大哥溥伒、五哥溥僩……溥仪的弟弟为什么叫溥杰？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257220]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/n9vnHe7gMbbKz39vzXngf5CNgOcufScH4M9oQc6A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;735&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/n9vnHe7gMbbKz39vzXngf5CNgOcufScH 4M9oQc6A. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251310&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From left: Song Xilian, Du Yuming, Pu Jie and Pu Yi in the Office of the Cultural and Historical Commissioner of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a child, because I read some stories about the last emperor, I not only knew about Puyi, but also knew that he had A younger brother named Pujie has a very close relationship with him. Later, I came to Beijing and lived in Dongcheng all year round. In my spare time, I would stroll in the alleys. I often saw Mr. Pujie&#39;s inscriptions and I admired them very much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu Yi is of the same generation as Pu, and his younger brother is named Pu Jie. There is no doubt about this. However, when I re-read &quot;The First Half of My Life&quot; written by Pu Yi, I saw a few passages that made me have a small question. The first paragraph is in the section &quot;Studying at Yuqing Palace&quot; in Chapter 2 &quot;My Childhood&quot;. Puyi mentioned some scenes of his studying at that time:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three people have received this honor, namely Puyi Jie, Yu Chong (son of Pu Lun, who has been reading Chinese with me), and Pu Jia (son of my seventh uncle Zaitao, who has been reading English with me since I was fourteen). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other two paragraphs are in Chapter 10. At this time, Puyi had returned to Beijing after ten years of transformation in the Northeast:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I heard Brother Brother&#39;s guqin and saw the words he wrote for me. His calligraphy attainments have indeed reached a new level. I also admired Brother Wu Wu’s new paintings of flowers and birds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My fifth sister, sixth brother Jian and I walked westward slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;听到这些亲切的称呼：大哥、五哥、六弟；看到他们的名字：溥伦、溥佳、溥伒、溥僩、溥俭，便知道他们和溥仪的关系非同一般，因为自康熙帝以来，就规定皇室子孙以两个字为名，第一个字表示辈分，第二个字的偏旁相同，表示兄弟行。溥伦的父亲原名载中，咸丰四年十二月奉旨过继给道光帝的长子奕纬为嗣，成为道光帝的长孙，改名载治。溥伦是载治的长子，也就是道光帝的曾长孙。溥佳是溥仪七叔载涛的长子。载涛是溥仪之父、摄政王载灃的胞弟，他们同为光绪帝载湉同父异母的弟弟。因此，溥仪和溥佳是堂兄弟。大哥溥伒、五哥溥僩、六弟溥俭都是道光皇帝第五子奕誴的孙子，具体说来，溥伒是奕誴第四子载瀛的长子，五哥溥僩是其胞弟；六弟溥俭是载瀛的三哥载澜的第六子。因此他们都与溥仪十分亲近。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/WpeIDbimA1gUDZWzcEnsdRZ6e3nbYe3bHR40s26U.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;557&quot; height=&quot;728&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/WpeIDbimA1gUDZWzcEnsdRZ6e3nbYe3bHR40s26U.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;一个人的名字，似乎仅是一个符号而已，但从这个人诞生的那一刻起，这个名字就承载了丰富的文化信息和文化内涵。它既可以是人类对于新的生命的一种体认；也可以表达父母对爱情天长地久的期许；同时它还饱含着祖辈对后世子孙繁荣昌盛的一种希冀，而个人则要在这枝繁叶茂的谱系中找到他所在的位置，他所有的家族荣耀，所应当承担的家族使命，也都因之而来。不可忽略的是，一个人的名字中还包含有各种历史的因子，与时代的命运相关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，到底选择哪些字来为儿孙取名，长辈就不仅要考虑这个字的读音，这个字和姓氏连读起来是否和谐，尽量避免因某种谐音而引起误会；还要考虑这个字所包含的意思，这个字本身是褒义的还是贬义的，是否有所忌讳。在传统的宗族社会，还一定会考虑这个字与家族宗谱的关系。有时候，这个关系是通过音韵来表达的，比如徐世昌和他的胞弟徐世光，从弟徐世纲、徐世良、徐世芳、徐世扬、徐世襄、徐世章等，末字都押江阳韵。更多的时候是通过字形来表达的，比如清代中兴名臣曾国藩，他的弟弟曾国潢、曾国葆、曾国荃等都带“艹”头；又比如当代著名学者周绍良先生，他给女儿分别起名为启琇、启璋、启瑜，都从“玉”旁，都遵循了这一传统。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;既如此，溥杰先生名字中的“亻”字旁去哪里了呢？如果翻阅繁体字版的宗族谱牒，问题就迎刃而解了，因为“杰”在古籍中还有另一个繁体字，写作“傑”。作为书画家，溥杰先生在一些书画作品的落款题字就作“溥傑”，印章也作“溥傑”。这样就可明白，溥杰先生并没有改名，也没有过继给其他皇室家族。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/l1HBRsfJHAWvJvNvkIlpuxdo2NqRJRFAnKtDKuOE.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/TBskXM88DDttCrtkWjC4J5P0m2bEYDMWVvAa65I7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1044&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/TBskXM88DDttCrtkWjC4J5P0m2bEYDMWVvAa65I7.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;溥仪胞弟的名字应当写作“溥杰”还是“溥傑”？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;若讲文化传统，无疑当写作“溥傑”，这样就可以一眼看得出他与溥仪、溥伦们的关系。然而，在文字改革的强烈呼声下，要简化就简化吧，写作“杰”也不坏。因此，我们看到溥杰先生自己落款时多有作“杰”的。如果这是他个人的意愿，我们应该尊重的，然而知人论世地想，他大概会庆幸印章还可以完好地保护着真正属于自己的名字，每每在落款处稳稳当当地盖上这个印章。这样的文化心理，现代人恐怕是不易理解，也不易感受的。 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;虽仍有争议，近几年电子竞技有成为正式“体育项目”的趋势。2023年6月，新加坡举办了首个“奥林匹克电子竞技周”及“奥林匹克电竞系列赛”，邀请了全球职业、业余选手参加比赛。即将到来的杭州亚运会上，电子竞技首次成为亚运会正式比赛项目并被记入国家奖牌榜，与棋类项目同属“智力项目”，涵盖5个PC端项目和两个手游端项目，将产生7枚金牌。7月8日，亚洲奥林匹克理事会宣布，电子竞技将再次入选2026年名古屋亚运会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国际奥委会电子竞技委员会的成立，预示着电子竞技离正式进入奥运会，成为一个永久性项目，又近了一步。它反映了国际奥委会进一步意识到电竞对奥运的价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电竞能为奥运带来巨大的利益。2023年，预计全球电竞观众规模达到5.74亿，全球电子竞技营收近18亿美元。电子竞技进入奥运会，会进一步扩展这个收益。国际奥委会也是看重这一点的，毕竟，任何组织都需要金钱才能生存、发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电竞的基础是电子游戏产业。电子游戏起源于20世纪50年代的美国，到了1980年代，随着电视机普及和电脑硬件的发展开始普及，到了1990年代中期，随着多媒体技术的兴起，游戏进入快速发展期。伴随着数字化时代的来临，智能手机的普及，从最早的家庭电脑游戏，到如今的多平台多用户在线游戏，游戏产业爆发式增长。电子游戏已经成为娱乐领域中规模最大的产业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在的游戏产业的营收，经远超电影票房，受疫情影响，2022年全球电影票房刚突破214亿美元，疫情之前，2019年全球电影票房为425亿美元，已是最高纪录。反观游戏产业，根据市场调查机构Newzoo发布的报告，预估2023年全球游戏市场营收规模为1877亿美元。这当中，移动市场预计将达到926亿美元，这也反映了手游在游戏产业中的地位。从受众看，在全球范围内，游戏玩家数量将从2020年的29亿人增长到2025年的35亿人，五年复合年增长率为4.2%。有一种观点认为，巨大的市场规模、受众规模，使得游戏成为绘画、雕刻、建筑、音乐、诗歌（文学）、舞蹈、戏剧、电影（影视）等八大艺术形式之后的第九艺术。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;游戏产业的发展催生了电竞的诞生。越来越多的玩家不仅打游戏，也开始观赏游戏竞技。某种程度上，这是全球参与人数最多、群众基础最好的“体育运动”。无论是传统的端游还是新兴的手游，都在电竞赛事中扮演了重要的角色。比如，杭州亚运会电子竞技项目就包括英雄联盟、王者荣耀亚运版本、和平精英亚运版本、FIFAOnline4。这些游戏都是受众最大的游戏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正因为电子游戏的广泛基础，电竞已经成为奥运和年轻群体之间的桥梁。国际奥委会主席托马斯•巴赫就表示，“虚拟体育可以补充和加强传统奥林匹克运动潜力，它将为运动员和观众们提供参与奥林匹克运动的新机遇”。“我们相信虚拟体育有助于弘扬作为奥运会核心的卓越、友谊和尊重的价值观，并且可以激励世界各地的年轻人参与体育运动并形成积极健康的生活方式”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，应该看到的是，电竞入奥运的利益博弈比传统项目更复杂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;传统体育项目，往往脱胎于历史悠久的运动，本身并不是一个商业的产物，也不存在知识产权与控制者，所以，国际奥委会可以相对独立地、完整地控制。但电子游戏不同，一开始就是产生于商业的。作为集娱乐、科技、竞技、直播、社交于一体的体育产业，电子竞技已经实现成熟化运营并形成了较为完整的产业链。这就意味着，电子竞技本身是“有主的”，除了游戏厂商，产业链各环节本身就有成熟的商业模式，来承接作为奥运项目产生的一系列利益。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，某种程度上，电子竞技进入奥运会，存在复杂的利益博弈与控制权之争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在成立电子竞技运动委员会的同时，国际奥委会也重申了他们对于电子竞技的定义：电子竞技是虚拟体育（Esports based on Traditional Sports），而非游戏电竞（Gaming Esports）。“虚拟体育”是“传统奥运项目”的补充和增强，是传统体育的辅助角色，仍将接受传统体育力量的全方位领导。从奥林匹克电竞委员会的成员结构来看，也是如此，大部分来自单体联协会、传统体育行业资深的营销、媒体人员。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，国际奥委会坚持两点不让步。第一，传统体育必须领导电竞；第二，竞赛内容必须合乎奥林匹克准则，游戏内容审核红线上，厂商必须妥协。基于这两点，国际奥委会可能会要求选择游戏，甚至定制有自己知识产权的游戏，。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但与此同时，奥运项目也必须是从市场上的游戏中选择，否则就没有受众。这种依赖不仅是指游戏厂商，也包括销售网络、营销、直播、视频平台。所以，奥委会也离不开电子竞技产业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个全新的情况。关于电子竞技入奥的利益拉锯还将持续很久，这也会影响到电子竞技最终进入奥运会正式项目的日程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;
