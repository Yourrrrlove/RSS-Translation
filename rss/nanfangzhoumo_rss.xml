As life progresses, a variety of new social identities will be acquired, including occupations, titles, Relationships, political identities, and more. When a person interrupts the process, deviates from the life trajectory preset by mainstream concepts, and retreats from society to the family, what words can he use to define himself? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s, British society classified people who were not employed, enrolled in higher education, or furthered as NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training). This term was adopted when it was introduced to Japan and Taiwan. The transliteration of &quot;Nite tribe&quot; is translated as &quot;gnawing old tribe&quot; in mainland China. But the &quot;elder-gnawing behavior&quot; is not limited to &quot;elder-gnawers.&quot; According to a China Family Tracking Survey by Peking University, the proportion of &quot;elder-gnawers&quot; among my country&#39;s working-age population jumped from less than 2% in 2010 to 40% in 2018. %above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese scholar Yamada Hiromasa proposed the term &quot;single parasites&quot; in 1999, which is more specific than NEET. It refers to those who have been delaying marriage and rely on their parents for daily life such as housing and food. People who use their income as &quot;pocket money&quot;. The male protagonist of the Japanese drama &quot;My Story is a Long Story&quot; is a &quot;single parasite&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is &quot;gnawing at the old&quot; or &quot;single parasitism&quot;, the words themselves have a certain derogatory color, and are only measured by social value. In the context of unavoidable stigma, some people who have returned to their families choose to define themselves as &quot;full-time children&quot;. Apart from all external social identities, they are at least the children of their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having full-time children is not a large number, nor is it an option that can be easily replicated, but it has caused a huge amount of discussion on the Internet. Rather than what a full-time son or daughter is or how to be a full-time son or daughter, we are more concerned about why they give up other identities. The reason why they have become full-time children is not only due to themselves, but also has a lot to do with the common difficulties they face in this era, but they have not been able to overcome it for the time being, or have given up the fight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jv6s6VVx0pKS8P6lINgiWhE5nOKQqLExILl63Ng2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jv6s6VVx0pKS8P6lINgiWhE5nOKQqLExILl63Ng2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251336&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Single sojourn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In The popularity of exchanges in the Douban group &quot;Exchange Center for Full-time Children&#39;s Work&quot; has subsided. Old posts from the past are constantly being dug up by students and reporters in journalism and sociology, showing a strong sense of exploration into &quot;full-time children&quot;. Such inquiries sometimes arouse resentment. Some people couldn&#39;t help but post and ask, &quot;Why are people suddenly paying attention to full-time children?&quot; Most of the people who responded thought it was hype and hot-button pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most active period of the group is from January to April 2023. Many people who choose to describe themselves as &quot;full-time children&quot; share their stories publicly. In these stories, happiness and relaxation are rare, and anxiety and confusion are the main themes: &quot;I feel that my sense of worth is very low&quot; &quot;I am especially tired when facing relatives, and my parents sometimes show dissatisfaction&quot; &quot;I have already started to feel anxious in the third week&quot; &quot;...Some people also mentioned that some people who become full-time children are under peer pressure and are easily traumatized - they are out of touch with the mainstream development path of society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The definition of full-time children in the group introduction is somewhat similar to the &quot;single parasitic family&quot;: single young people, living in their parents&#39; homes and enjoying financial assistance from their parents. The difference is that full-time children will work hard in exchange for financial assistance, and they do not give up employment, but keep studying, waiting for opportunities to return to the workplace, or take public postgraduate entrance examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This definition is consistent with most full-time children aged 20-30, although it is not applicable to those over 30 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixi is 26 years old, and her situation fits the definition of a full-time child. After graduating from an overseas master&#39;s degree in December 2022, she went through various considerations of applying for a doctorate and finding a job, and finally chose to concentrate on preparing for the civil service exam at home. The background of her circle of friends is Russell&#39;s famous saying: &quot;Don&#39;t feel guilty for sleeping in, because you can&#39;t create much value when you get up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixi believes that major has the greatest influence on her career choice. She majored in education. “Two of my classmates from the same school who studied accounting and marketing quickly joined the workforce. One joined PricewaterhouseCoopers and the other joined Mercedes-Benz. But these big companies don’t require education. student.&quot; Her original career plan was to enter a university after completing her Ph.D., but during the four months of applying in 2022, she felt tremendous pressure. Being infected with the new crown epidemic in December was the last straw that crushed her. The application was abandoned. Later, when she accidentally opened her mailbox, Xixi discovered that she had received an offer from the University of Birmingham in the UK, but by that time she had missed the deadline to apply for a scholarship. &quot;It is too low cost to spend millions to study for a doctorate in liberal arts at your own expense.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;A 985 master&#39;s degree in liberal arts is not as good as a bachelor&#39;s degree in computer science with three majors.&quot; Xixi felt this from the salary. A friend of hers joined an Internet company after graduating with a bachelor&#39;s degree in computer science. After a few years, his annual salary rose to 600,000 yuan. When she was applying for a master&#39;s degree, she briefly found a job with a monthly salary of only 3,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When taking the civil service exam this time, Xixi did not prepare for the exam while working as she did when applying for a master&#39;s degree. She found that the competition is too fierce now, and the number of people taking the civil service exam has increased significantly in recent years. Taking the National Civil Service Examination as an example, since 2021, the number of applicants has increased by about 500,000 every year, reaching 1.51 million in 2021 and exceeding 2.5 million in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixi’s parents supported her decision to stay at home and find a job. Her father said to her: “Don’t worry, you can slowly find a job that you are more satisfied with.” One of her classmates was not so lucky. The family&#39;s financial situation is good, but his parents really wanted him to find a job as soon as possible after graduating from the master&#39;s degree. He could only find a job as a counselor in a local technical secondary school in a hurry, with a monthly salary of two to three thousand, and the work was very tiring. “He wanted to take the entrance examination for a certain position, but he had no energy to review after work, so he was caught in a dilemma: he was reluctant to give up his current job because he was afraid that he would not be able to find another job in the future; he was tired, unhappy and had little money if he didn’t give up. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the lessons learned from her classmates, Xixi prepares for the provincial exam with peace of mind at home. Her family&#39;s finances are jointly managed by her parents and her. She can freely use the fraction of her savings, which is enough to cover her living expenses, but she does not have to take on housework. &quot;I mainly want to be a companion.&quot; After going to college, Xixi rarely grew up like this. Spending time living with her parents, my mother cherishes her days at home. Every night, my parents watch TV in the living room, while Xixi does aerobics. One day when Xixi went to her room to exercise, her mother asked unaccustomedly, &quot;Why don&#39;t you dance outside today?&quot; Push her to work, but she still feels anxious, and she feels like her days at home are getting nowhere. &quot;We are in a result-oriented society. I cannot accept the view that life is not a track but a wilderness. I am still trapped by the mainstream values ​​of society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Professional Value&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Douban There is a question thread in the group, &quot;Why do children become full-time workers?&quot; Among the 16 answers, the reason &quot;doesn&#39;t want to work/can&#39;t find a job&quot; accounted for 11, including young people who are unemployed after graduation. In 2023, the youth unemployment rate continues to rise. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the national urban survey of the population aged 16-24 years old, the unemployment rate exceeded 20% from April to June 2023. Since August, this data has been suspended release. When some young people who cannot find jobs return to their families, they become full-time children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lan Qi is one of the unemployed youth aged 16-24. She understands that having a full-time job is not a normal way of employment. &quot;I also get a salary at home, but it cannot be compared with going out to work outside. Any kind of job should communicate with the outside world.&quot; Lan Qi was forced to stay at home. She had a job after graduating from undergraduate school, but her father rejected it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;His worries are too conservative. Isn&#39;t it safe for a girl to go on a business trip for a few days? What&#39;s more, there are female colleagues traveling with her. His concept is that after I get married, I will have nothing to do with him. Before, we had to protect our daughter&#39;s reputation. The value of a virgin is better than anything else in her growth.&quot; Lan Qi did not try to persuade her father and resigned and returned home. She was pained by the absurd stubbornness of her parents and her own weakness, and had no courage to find a new job. &quot;I feel like I am useless. I am lagging behind my peers and out of touch with society. I am like Juexin in &quot;Home&quot; and Nora in &quot;A Doll&#39;s House&quot;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In me Among all the stories about stay-at-home children that I have read, Lanqi’s case is very special. I was not sure whether she belonged to this group, but she chose the word herself because she liked the professional attributes in it. &quot;As long as there is labor, it is a career. Some people think that children who work full-time are &#39;cheating on the old&#39;, but I don&#39;t agree. &#39;Cheating on the old&#39; means relying on their parents for food and clothing without putting in any work, which means losing one&#39;s own value. I want to do housework too. Valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lan Qi made me realize that in most descriptions of full-time children, the children should be the dominant one, asking their parents for financial assistance to provide for their own lives, but in fact Parents may also be the ones in control, and their attitudes and concepts shape the appearance of the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lanqi’s parents believe that doing housework is a better choice for women than working outside the home. Lan Qi said, &quot;They seem to be cultivating a housework machine. They do housework and cook for the future when they get married, and the skills they learn are for future generations. For example, my mother thinks that I learn swimming so that my children can learn it faster. .&quot; One time I was chatting with Lan Qi, and she said that she was cooking dinner that night, and her mother said to her, &quot;You took my place.&quot; She felt very sad, &quot;She could have worked hard in society, but she was doing heavy housework at home. , can the heart be willing and the emotion be willing?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concept of Lan Qi&#39;s parents comes from their ancestors, &quot;My grandfather &#39;protected&#39; his daughters very well, which was very rare in that era. They had a good reputation and were surrounded by neighbors. Quite recognized.&quot; Lanqi&#39;s parents hope that she will be a daughter who is waiting to be born, and she chooses to be a full-time child. Modern and traditional are integrated in this word, so it is both understandable and novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0HS9ni4yQzkUz8L7e5v5VxyjTfDi9SPGBnIha9zC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;679&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0HS9ni4yQzkUz8L7e5v5VxyjTfDi9SPGBnIha9zC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251335&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Puppet on a string&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Among the reasons for becoming a full-time child, Yue Hang’s answers left a deep impression on me. She was the first person to accept my request for an interview. Before the interview, I didn’t realize how courageous she was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang’s narration drew me to Shenzhen, a hot and humid place with endless summers. In 2017, 25-year-old Yue Hang returned from studying abroad, and her father found her a job in Shenzhen. This job made her unhappy. At the end of 2020, she lost her sense of smell. After that, her skin problems worsened, her acne bleeds, and her attempts to resolve the unpleasantness all failed. In the spring of 2021, the second job her father found brought a turnaround in her life, but she was persuaded to quit after a three-month probation period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wait while I light a cigarette.&quot; Yue Hang said, but she didn&#39;t take a few puffs in total. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang’s first job was in a family business. The boss was from Chaoshan, Guangdong. There were less than 10 employees in the office, most of whom were relatives of the boss. Yue Hang couldn&#39;t even understand Chaoshan dialect, and she couldn&#39;t understand it until she left her job. She was like an outsider in the office and could only do things in silence. Salaries have basically never been increased. In 2020, the company&#39;s performance was not good and wages began to be owed. Other non-relative colleagues resigned, but Yue Hang persisted - she also submitted several resumes, but received no response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This company is not equipped with dormitories. When Yue Hang first arrived, he still had expectations for life. His salary was 5,000 yuan and he spent 3,500 yuan on renting a house. Later, her rental price dropped to 800 yuan. &quot;It&#39;s not a good house. It&#39;s cheap. I don&#39;t want to spend a dime on this job. I also struggled with myself. I endured hardship, but it didn&#39;t work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the company finally allocated dormitories, and Yue Hang moved in even though there was no air conditioning. She admitted that her mentality at the time was a bit stupid, &quot;Finally, the company provided free housing, and I had to live there to earn back my money.&quot; The highest temperature in Shenzhen in summer can exceed 40 degrees Celsius. Yue Hang was so hot that she was desperate while calculating her profits and losses. Only later did she realize I have suffered a great loss, and my health has been compromised. &quot;I hate that company, so I have to recover the psychological gap from the financial aspect. It&#39;s just that I feel it&#39;s unfair to get such a small salary.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second company made Yue Hang feel much better, until his boss He asked her: &quot;What did your parents teach you?&quot; He even criticized her in public and called her father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the four years of working in Shenzhen, Yue Hang was like a screw in a machine, always tense and unable to relax. The weekly working hours are from Monday to Saturday, with only one day off on Sunday. She will eat a lot of desserts and stuff them into her mouth until she feels like vomiting, just to get a little happiness. Although such happiness was short-lived, she didn&#39;t know where else to find it. When she had insomnia at night, she would masturbate to make herself fall asleep quickly, &quot;I need to have enough sleep to be able to serve my work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the night when she resigned from the second company, Yue Hang I have been lying in front of my desk, thinking about what happened in the week before leaving my job. Her whole body was frozen in place like a puppet. If she wanted to move, her body could move, but she had no will to drive her body. She fell into stupor for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, Yue Hang went out of town to attend a relative’s wedding on behalf of her family—both her parents worked, and she was the only one free. At the wedding, Yue Hang suddenly fell into a coma. Her parents came to take her home and sent her to a psychiatric ward the next day. She became a puppet again, conscious but unable to leave the darkness. She woke up only a few days later. Her depression was already severe. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The overdraft generation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In November 2021, Yue Hang was discharged from the hospital and began a life of recuperation at home. She almost shuts herself away and rarely communicates with her parents. They would get angry when they saw her sitting on the sofa &quot;doing nothing,&quot; so she always stayed in her room alone. Like a rebound from the regular life of commuting to and from work in the past, her sleeping time has become disorderly, and she will let herself suffer from insomnia. &quot;I just coax myself, not to be anxious, and I don&#39;t have to go to work anyway.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In February 2022, after returning to her hometown as a child, Yue Hang resumed socializing, driving to meet friends, eat delicious food, and visit scenic spots... She likes to travel by car, but she has almost no chance to use a car in the past few years in Shenzhen. Her life includes many activities that were not available during her working life: trying to plant flowers and plants, going to the rooftop to dry clothes in the sunshine, and collecting express cartons to sell scrap products. She likes the process of collecting cartons. She first selects the largest carton, then unpacks and flattens other small cartons to stuff more things into a fixed space. Although the cartons collected for several months can only be sold for ten A few dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the small town in his hometown, apart from paying social security, Yue Hang’s other living expenses are about 1,000 yuan. Her parents gave her a living allowance, and she also earned pocket money through part-time work - she worked as a temporary assistant in a photography studio, earning 50 yuan for half a day. Since 2023, she has also worked as a temporary dishwasher in a hotel. These two jobs made her feel comfortable. The customers who came to take pictures wanted beautiful photos and were very polite to the staff. After the dishwashing work was over, she was able to share some dishes that had not been touched with chopsticks. &quot;This kind of physical work doesn&#39;t require using your brain and gives you a sense of accomplishment. As long as you finish the work in front of you, you don&#39;t have to work overtime after get off work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doing these two jobs is a rare independent decision-making for her. From a young age, Yue Hang&#39;s life has been arranged by her parents. When she graduated from junior high school, her parents suggested that she study abroad. She agreed. She completed high school and university abroad, and majored in economics, which is easier to find a job. Now, her parents&#39; investment in her education has become a burden and pressure on her. &quot;Even if your parents don&#39;t show their disappointment in front of you, it&#39;s difficult for children to not find this feeling if they have been raised for a long time and cannot find a job. They have not been able to make money for so long and it does not meet their expectations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang feels that his qualifications are average, especially not good at taking exams. After returning to China, her parents asked her to take the junior economist exam, but she failed and was unwilling to take other certificates. She was also not good at socializing, and only gradually became more open-minded after returning home. She is not used to fighting for anything. She didn&#39;t write her resume well when she wanted to change jobs. Recently, she changed it to a more formal version when she was looking for a job. She will also write down her experience as a dishwasher to enrich her resume. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Yue Hang also has a sense of frustration in the face of the times, &quot;It is impossible for me to make more money than my parents. In their era, as long as you worked hard, you would have money, but I worked hard, and I I don’t have money to work overtime.” Yue Hang felt that many of the peers she saw in Shenzhen worked harder than her parents. Their generation worked harder but got less. &quot;We seem to have overdrawn our lives in advance. We have been busy attending cram schools since elementary school. We don&#39;t know what progress we are making. We can&#39;t catch up with a house or even a relaxing vacation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two years of being a full-time mother and daughter have been the happiest time for Yue Hang in recent years, and she has considered continuing to do so. In 2022, my grandma had an operation. During this period, Yue Hang proposed to his father that he wanted to be her caregiver. &quot;When I was hospitalized before, my parents hired me a caregiver, which paid me two to three hundred (remuneration) a day. I wanted to make this money. Of course, as long as they took care of my food, I wouldn&#39;t ask them to pay the price of a caregiver. Please ask me. But my father doesn&#39;t agree.&quot; Yue Hang feels that he can act as a nanny among relatives. In addition to his grandparents, his parents will also face care needs, because they all only have one child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang’s condition has stabilized a lot, and he is currently trying to find a new job, such as the food department or transportation department of IKEA. “It requires physical work, no overtime, plenty of exercise, and you don’t have to worry about so many interpersonal relationships. , taking into account physical health and mental health.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5pnGTNAYzfxYTyw3tMlHgbRtlytjPo5Ob5t5BLlp.jpg&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5pnGTNAYzfxYTyw3tMlHgbRtlytjPo5Ob5t5BLlp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251337&quot;>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Crazy Work&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang believes that the biggest constraint for children who work full time is financial resources. She does not want to rely on her parents all the time, so she can only continue to work. For Qingtian, a 37-year-old with 10 years of work experience, she does not have much financial burden, so she can calmly resign and withdraw from the labor market. She refers to herself as &quot;laying down trash&quot;. At the end of 2022, friends forwarded her a topical article about full-time children, with the sentence &quot;You are so typical.&quot; She rolled her eyes and approved of the new title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stay-at-home children reminded Qingtian of a report he had read about Japanese people in their thirties and forties who nibbled on the elderly. One of the stories was that a 40-year-old daughter accompanied her 60-year-old mother on a trip abroad. , my daughter is very envious of her mother’s high pension. In &quot;The Choice of Being a Woman&quot;, she saw Chizuru Ueno having a similar discussion in 2003, &quot;&#39;60s generation&#39; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Refers to people aged 60-69&lt;/span>;) whose parents had retired before the economic downturn and widespread layoffs, and received generous pensions. It can be said that they are the first and last generation to fully enjoy the economy. People with high growth and good fortune. But the next generation does not have that kind of protection. It is precisely because this generation’s family has a strong financial background that it provides the possibility for their children to live in old age.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After resigning, his parents gave Qingtian a slap in the face. A large sum of money supported her life, and she put most of it into the stock market. Although she has lost a lot of money, she has confidence in the stock market. &quot;Our family started stock trading in the 1990s, and we have experienced several bull and bear markets. I believe we will always come back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingtian was originally a middle-level cadre of a medium-sized Internet advertising company. What made her put down her career was her work. The futility and absurdity felt in it. In 2020, the company advocated cost reduction and efficiency improvement. Employees&#39; salaries were reduced by 15% and no bonuses were given. However, the company&#39;s performance that year was not bad. At the end of the year, the company&#39;s top executives went to Macau for the annual meeting. Qingtian&#39;s leader came back and showed off to her privately, &quot;The Rolex watch I just bought doesn&#39;t look good, and I want to change it.&quot; Qingtian thought of her employees, &quot;They are all good students of 985 and 211, diligent and diligent They worked diligently overtime, worried about losing their jobs, and didn’t complain when called by customers in the middle of the night, but they only paid several thousand yuan a month, what’s their fault?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a colleague in Qingtian died of pancreatic cancer. , at the funeral, a former colleague who joined a leading Internet retail company vividly said that there was a row of AEDs hanging in their office. The first thing new employees did when they joined the company was to practice cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, because of the high salary, many people inside wanted to change jobs. Go to their department. She lamented, &quot;The corporate culture is completely different from our previous company. We don&#39;t have to go through procedures or hold meetings. We just work! We are very motivated.&quot; Qingtian feels that the value has been impacted. &quot;Without people, there is nothing. Why are everyone so crazy? Why is this industry so crazy?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sense of value of &quot;hard work&quot; and &quot;self-realization&quot; that he always believed in in the past has gradually turned into &quot;self-exploitation&quot; and &quot;self-brainwashing&quot; in Qingtian&#39;s heart. . She has witnessed the success stories of the explosion of the Internet industry, and has also experienced anger and disappointment at the serious imbalance in the company&#39;s distribution of interests. She no longer seeks meaning in her work. &quot;The meaning of work to ordinary people is to earn money to support themselves and their families. If the family has a certain amount of accumulation, why not make some different choices so that both themselves and their families can live comfortably?&quot; Qingtian thought of the colleague who passed away. The last Douban broadcast complained about the relationship with her family, &quot;She never reconciled with her parents until her death.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because she was an only child, Qingtian had a close relationship with her parents, and because she had a failed marriage before, She does not plan to start a family anymore and wants to maintain the balance and happiness of living with her parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingtian lives in Guangzhou, and her parents live in the countryside of Huizhou. She often goes back to the village to stay. In the past, when I was working, I could only go home during the Mid-Autumn Festival and Spring Festival. What I saw was the golden rice and the remaining rice stubble. Now, she can fully witness the various stages of rice fields including irrigation, transplanting, heading, and harvesting. She would take her parents on trips, taking care of everything along the way and arranging visits to museums and natural scenery. Even if it was just a visit to the local vegetable market, the family would be very happy. She helped her parents take photos and edit videos, and discovered that they actually wanted to &quot;be seen.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her parents did not interfere with Qingtian&#39;s choices. She talked with her father about planting flowers and birds, calligraphy and painting, and told him that the richness of life now is five times that of the past. Occasionally, her mother would worry that Qingtian was getting further and further away from re-employment, but seeing that she was happy, she didn&#39;t say much and suggested that she study for a degree and experience more different experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only thing they worried about was that after they &quot;left&quot;, Qingtian would be left alone. This is also a problem Qingtian is worried about, but she has not found a solution yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O0LCKe0HfmalBlPeoiPfuD5lEnPky2BXcSD6JJJQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O0LCKe0HfmalBlPeoiPfuD5lEnPky2BXcSD6JJJQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251333&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What is your function? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the Douban group, the living conditions of older children who work full-time are obviously more relaxed and self-consistent than that of young people. Among the anxious and confused headlines, &quot;37-year-old children who work full-time are happy every day&quot; is particularly eye-catching. . Qingtian replied to this post and expressed his agreement. However, Qingtian believes that children who work full-time have two things in common: first, their families have good economic conditions and their parents have high pensions, and second, they have harmonious family relationships. The situation of the poster, the gardener, is not entirely consistent with this. She does not believe that having children full-time is an option only for a well-to-do family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gardener is from Dalian, Liaoning. In mid-2022, the gardener&#39;s parents retired, and their pensions totaled more than 7,000 yuan. At the end of the year, they all found another job and had an additional income of four to five thousand yuan. The gardener said that although the money was not much, fortunately the family of three did not have high material desires. The gardener kept accounts and statistics of expenses. Every month, family living expenses are about 1,000 to 1,500 yuan. Her parents’ pocket money adds up to 1,000 yuan. Her pocket money is 1,500 yuan, a total of three to four thousand yuan. The income is enough to cover daily expenses. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On every working day, the gardener is responsible for buying vegetables and cooking. She would buy vegetables the afternoon before and cook at 9 or 10 a.m. As usual, she would prepare two green vegetables a day. The meat dishes would be prepared on Monday, such as braised pork, and she would eat a few pieces at a time and then cook them after eating. My mother would come home at 11:30 noon to pack rice to take away, my father would eat at work at noon, and my parents would eat the leftovers from lunch in the evening. In the afternoon, in addition to buying vegetables, the gardener will make bread and pastries and make snacks for his parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My mother doesn&#39;t know how to cook. She hasn&#39;t been able to cook since she was a child, so my father cooked when I was a child. However, my father only cooks the same old food, and the food he cooks is not very delicious. .” The gardener believed that her parents asked her to cook because they felt that she was more suitable for cooking at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gardener has a sense of identity with this &quot;job&quot;, &quot;I have many benefits from cooking at home. I will give them scientific combinations according to dietary guidelines, such as fruits, vegetables, carbohydrates, and milk. If I hadn&#39;t done it, Their health may not be as good as it is now.&quot; She believes that she is different from most full-time children, and she is really taking care of her parents. A netizen replied to her post, &quot;I am about the same age and status as Luzhu (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Owner&lt;/span>;), but my mother mainly cooks at home. It&#39;s time to get ready to improve your cooking skills.&quot; The gardener asked her, &quot;Then what is your function?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You have to reflect your value. You can&#39;t just get express delivery as your function, right? Like me , I take care of the family&#39;s finances, make future plans for the family, save money, pay mortgages, and buy things. I don&#39;t work now, and I will try my best to spend less money and live a better life.&quot; Buy Before putting things in her hands, the gardener would think about alternatives in life. For example, she used baking soda instead of dish soap. If she really wants to buy, she will first go to second-hand websites to find brand-new products, or make careful use of coupons on e-commerce platforms. &quot;When you are making money, calculating these is a waste of time, but when you are not making money, calculation is making money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even at home, the gardener lives a very disciplined life. He goes to bed at 9 o&#39;clock every night and goes to bed in the morning. Get up at 6 o&#39;clock and spend most of the day busy. She has never been a lazy person. Before becoming a full-time child, she changed more than a dozen jobs. After each resignation, she would try to find another job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of her previous jobs were clerical, such as travel consulting, hotel reception, office administration, etc. The reason for her resignation was almost always &quot;disagreement with the leader.&quot; &quot;I lacked emotional intelligence and spoke directly. When I first graduated, I didn&#39;t understand anything about society. My father was a worker and my mother ran a small business. They couldn&#39;t teach me anything. Later, I gradually became able to understand eye expressions, but I still don’t understand the need to be diplomatic in situations like the wine table. But I don’t want to change it. Having a high emotional intelligence may mean lowering myself.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2019, the gardener resigned from his last job. , planning to open his own bakery. She taught herself baking in her spare time, can make Chinese and Western snacks, and can even make birthday cakes. In November 2019, she rented a store. It took two months to renovate and it was officially opened in January 2020. However, it was blocked by the COVID-19 epidemic only more than 20 days after opening. It opened again in May 2020. In 2022, Dalian has been under strict epidemic control since June. There was no business until November. The gardener no longer renewed his lease. &quot;I quit. After three years of business, I lost hundreds of thousands.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I asked the gardener, not long after the store was closed, the epidemic prevention and control ended. Do you regret it? Although she regretted the timing of closing the store, she remained calm, &quot;I knew I couldn&#39;t make money, and I couldn&#39;t do it big because I didn&#39;t want to hire people. From selecting raw materials to making it and handing it over to customers, I had to do it all myself. &quot;She closed the store not only because of the epidemic. She found it annoying to deal with customers. &quot;In the service industry, you will meet a lot of weird people. I haven&#39;t done enough work, but I am a little tired of dealing with people.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The shop is closed, but the gardener&#39;s business is still running. She will take orders from some old customers through the WeChat store and earn back her monthly social security fees. &quot;Earning more than a thousand yuan won&#39;t affect my mood in life, and it won&#39;t waste much of my time. If it&#39;s too much, it won&#39;t work and I&#39;ll start to get annoyed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I don&#39;t want to follow the crowd. &quot;Son&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The gardener&#39;s parents are very supportive of her decision to go home without working. They think that the three members of the family should perform their own duties. The mother cannot cook, the father does not cook well, and the two We are all people who can&#39;t stay at home and like to work outside the house. We just leave things at home to the gardener. Sometimes the gardener reported to her mother how much pocket money she had spent this month, and her mother comforted her, &quot;Okay, this money is not enough to find a cook from outside.&quot; She said to her mother, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to work, you Raise me.&quot; Mother said cheerfully, &quot;Fine, can&#39;t you raise me?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gardener&#39;s view, my father was simpler than my mother. Once she suggested, &quot;How about we take care of the whole house?&quot; Sold, the three of us will travel around the country together, and we will live wherever the place is good.&quot; My father said, &quot;Then you should act quickly.&quot; Sometimes the gardener feels that she is the person who thinks the most in the family, more like a Parents, &quot;The classic saying from both of them is, &#39;Don&#39;t think so much, just take it one step at a time.&#39; They have no plan for the next step. They support me in whatever I do and believe that what I do is right. Without my words, The two of them are still living in the town, and their lives are definitely not as good as they are now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gardener and her parents bought two small houses in the same community. She bought them first, and later saw that her father&#39;s provident fund was enough After collecting the down payment for a house, I suggested that my parents buy a house in the building next door. The parents do not know how to apply for loans or pay online, and the gardener is responsible for all procedures and loan repayment plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gardener is also concerned about the health management of her parents. She also arranges physical examinations for her parents every year. My mother was diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer during a physical examination. During the surgery and hospitalization, the gardener accompanied her throughout the entire process. Later, she also wrote a guide on caring for hospitalized patients on her personal public account, &quot;It is very detailed from beginning to end. I am a Virgo and I am very careful in my work. Even if the patient is paralyzed on the bed, I will not let her get bedsores.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Where can I find another child like me? I take good care of my parents, and I don&#39;t get married and have children. I don&#39;t want my parents to have to worry about and help take care of their children in their sixties.&quot; The gardener has no plans to get married, have children, or start a family, so he has always been closely connected with his parents in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to the family, the gardener has more time to return to herself. In her free time, she likes to watch movies and books. &quot;I can watch 60 movies a month.&quot; She especially likes Yang Dechang&#39;s &quot;Yi Yi&quot; and Sean Penn&#39;s &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, and her favorite novel is &quot;Blade&quot; by Maugham. She admires the hero Larry&#39;s uniqueness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Withdrawing from “following the crowd” and getting rid of outside voices and mainstream ideas, she was able to understand herself more clearly, “It turns out that I am a person who cannot handle intimate relationships; I am not a social person. I am very kind and sincere to my friends, but I also want to live a more independent life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/09/20/AnfmnE77VwgCr3DKzeklQ7SH0wCHSQ2p80KkNGZC.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;减减今年42岁，北京人，多年在外地工作。 5年前的深圳，减减有一天上班时忽然接到父亲的电话，父亲那会儿在公园散步，走累了坐在路边，想儿子了。减减听到电话那头传来的“想你了”，眼泪一下流了出来。自打毕业后，他就没有和父母住在一起，即使在北京工作，和父母的联系也不多。后来他去天津、上海工作，又追着前妻来到深圳，婚姻没有挽回，离父母却更远了。 “我发现自己追求事业，追求爱情，却一直忽略了父母，我开始想回北京了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还没等减减完全下定决心，他就得知了父亲突发心肌梗塞住进CCU（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;心脏重症监护室&lt;/span>;）的消息，“我脑子&#39;嗡&#39;的一下，心乱如麻，缓了好一阵。”减减当即辞职，买了机票回北京，在病房见到了父亲。父亲心梗堵塞90%，且伴有严重的心衰，命悬一线，又因肺部有炎症不能立即做手术，整个人瘦到脱相。 “他看见我说，&#39;这回是不是我得把银行卡密码都告诉你了？&#39;我差点又哭出来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那段时间，减减每天变着花样做饭、熬鸡汤，给父亲送去医院，他明显感到父亲心情好多了，还发短信说病友们都羡慕他，其他人想吃饺子，跟儿女说了好几天才叫来一个外卖。一个月后，父亲做完手术出院，减减也想明白了对他来说什么是最重要的，“不是在事业上取得多大的成绩，因为事业总会有波峰波谷，不是和爱人卿卿我我，因为婚姻不过是利益的结合。只有父母才是真正一辈子对你好的人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;减减毕业于北京大学广告学系，传播最广的广告作品是哈药六厂的新盖中盖高钙片。 2014年他尝试写剧本，但碰上资本寒冬，剧本写完拍不了，又进了企业工作。现在回家，他重新拾起了写剧本的活儿。 “虽然收入比起以前差很多，也极不稳定，但是我总算有时间陪伴家人了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;减减跟父亲一起生活，父亲退休工资五千多，家里日常开销都由父亲负责。他写剧本的平均收入是一个月5000元，负责缴纳社保、汽车保险、汽油费、物业费和取暖费等，一年大约3万元。他认为自己和父亲在经济支出上是互相帮助，并非啃老，而是全职儿女。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以前工作时，他赚得多，但消费也多，离婚后基本没有剩下多少积蓄；现在，不稳定的收入降低了他的消费欲望，他不旅游、不逛街、不在外吃饭，省去不必要的社交，还学会了理发，很多原本需要花钱才能得到的服务全由自己做，反而存下了一些钱。 “我的养老金肯定没他们高，所以得努力攒钱为将来打算。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父亲不能完全接受减减的选择，也不支持他写剧本，有时候会对着他说教，“天天窝在家里不是个事。”减减考虑到父亲心脏不好，不想惹他生气，和导演打电话时都躲在房间避开他。有一次实在受不了，出去住了一个星期，回家后发现父亲说话嗓子很别扭，他意识到那是因为父亲一个星期没和人说话了，“我一下子体会到他的孤独，心又软了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“选择做全职儿女放弃了很多东西，我觉得值。”减减回想过去的生活，发现从上幼儿园开始，他就没有好好陪伴父母生活过，“上班的上班，上学的上学，回家后也就是一起吃个饭，然后又各干各的了；等工作了、结婚了就更不用说。”现在，他陪父亲一起散步、研究菜谱、看热播的电视剧、聊天南海北的新闻，最喜欢做的事是给父亲理发、修脚。他获得了一种前所未有的踏实感，“我在拉萨待过半年，心情远比现在浮躁。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他把这些感想化成剧本中的一段台词：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“有时候我真觉得咱们这些北漂挺可怕的。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“怎么可怕了？”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“哪个北漂不是为了自己的事业把年迈的父母丢在老家？春去秋来，回家看望父母的次数比候鸟还少。有媒体曾经统计过，一个25岁的北漂，按照一年回一次家的频率来计算，他这辈子还能陪伴父母的时间就剩下一个月。现在想想，咱们的心还真是够狠的！”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;刘明胜（化名）在江苏张家港一家私企做会计，下载某聊天软件后进入了女主播K宝的直播间，只看一眼便迷上了。根据平台游戏规则，只有成为“榜一大哥”才能取得会见主播的资格。他月薪不过6000元，遂利用职务便利，偷偷转公款打赏。成为K宝直播间“榜一大哥”之后，他如愿和K宝成为线下情人，并发生两性关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年初，集团公司对账时，发现刘明胜掌管的账目有大笔的资金亏空。据公安机关调查，他从公司的账上一共挪走公款约1.23亿元，先后打赏K宝9000万元，给另两名主播也分别打赏了几百万元。最终，被他挪用的约1.23亿元巨额资金大部分得以追回，共计追回1.2268亿元。刘明胜以职务侵占罪被判14年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这“过把瘾就死”的劲儿令人咋舌。其实，此类出纳挪用公款打赏主播的案例还不少，并且男女出纳都有。如银某为广西某房地产开发集团出纳，从2020年起，她爱慕抖音APP的某男主播，疯狂打赏，自己没钱了便动用公款。警方调查发现，她的抖音号2020年下半年充值500多万元，有430万余是用于打赏男主播，其中144万余系公司公款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;又如，李某担任珠海某公司济南大区出纳，2018年12月至2020年4月，利用公司财务管理漏洞，将4826.4303万公款转至个人账户，用于打赏女主播、游戏充值、娱乐消费、谈女朋友等，其中直播打赏2000余万。事发后，这位“榜一大哥”被判12年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这类事件的一大共性是出纳收入不高，但过手的钱多，如果个人没有很好的品性与职业伦理，很容易陷入心态失衡，而出纳最明白公司的财务漏洞在哪里，所以他们一旦“有心算无心”，公司财务制度至少一段时间内都形同虚设。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个值得思考的方向是：网络直播究竟是一个什么样的行业，主要满足了谁的什么方面的需求？那些人挥霍自己的钱、父母的钱甚至公司的钱，打赏异性主播，究竟是何种心态？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;网络直播包含了若干种不同的业态，其中之一是至今方兴未艾的直播带货。如果将其仅仅看成一种新的分销渠道就错了，因为与线下渠道或其他“传统”电商渠道相比，主播卖的可不仅仅是货。尤其是那些做得比较成功的主播，同时贩卖“人设”、提供情绪价值，有类似明星-粉丝的关系存在，往往满足了异性粉丝对另一半的最好想象，甚至性幻想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;或者，甚至可以这么说，那些红得发紫的主播，明明做好静好安暖或美美哒的“人设”就可以向粉丝收钱，竟然还额外附送一些还能用得上的商品，真是太“厚道”了。于是，沿着这条路径，“直播带货”的一部分会进化成“直播打赏”，既然不带货也能挣钱，那就不带货、不卖货，直接向粉丝卖“人设”就行了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，“直播打赏”也有多个不同的来源，受众与性质迥异，所以需要分开讨论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，其另一条进化路径是过去天桥杂耍、街头卖艺及卖惨乞讨从线下转到了线上，其主要受众或是草根阶层或是不特定公众，本文不再赘述。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一条进化路径是，分享欲与窥看欲的互联网化并进一步视频化。一些人把自己的工作、生活、爱好或技能通过视频与大家分享，有直播的，也有录播的，也不乏成功的案例，如钓鱼能手、套圈王、“手工耿”之类，让大家增加了对自己陌生领域的了解与知见，或让大家身临其境感受到自己向往的生活。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们这里重点讨论的“直播打赏”，有显著的主播-粉丝关系，并且一般是男主播-女粉丝、女主播-男粉丝关系，这就不可避免多少带有性意味&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“饮食男女，人之大欲存焉”“食色性也”，毋庸讳言，人的生命力很大一部分系于性能量或性欲望上。让无数中老年女性倾倒的“秀才”，让无数中老年男性倾倒的“一笑倾城”，让无数青年男女如痴如醉的明星，本质并无二致，说到是这些主播或明星的长相、气质与“人设”满足了异性对另一半最好的幻想，这才是这类“纯直播打赏”的发生学与动力学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鲁迅说，不满是向上的车轮。很少有人对自己目前的生活是完全满意的，对工作不满，对男女朋友或配偶不满，遂期望一种理想的生活，包括理想的配偶，也是人之常情。但是首先要明白自己的能力边界，明白自己在这个社会中是什么样的排序，这样就会对自己目前的生活是否“配得上自己”、人间是否“值得”有一个挤去水分的客观判断，自知者明。然后对于现状，该改变就改变，该接受就接受，这就是跟自己和解。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而如果为了精神上的满足，把家中的大额财物甚至不是自己的财物打赏给异性主播，那实质上不是在提升而是在毁掉自己的生活。上述男女出纳挪用公款打赏异性主播正是此类情形。总之，每一个人应该把自己旺盛的生命力用在提升自己上，这样配得上的好东西就越来越多，这是正向利用自己生命能量的方法，而不是消耗自己的所有资源乃至生命力去满足自己的幻想。置个人的荣誉与前途不顾，只为“过把瘾就死”，枉费了人世间走一遭的好机缘。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;Concept-oriented Petzold&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among contemporary German film directors, Christian Petzold may be the most eye-catching of one. The previous &quot;Ghost Trilogy&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The Abode of the Heart&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Yela&quot;&lt;/span>;) and &quot;Immigration Trilogy&quot; &quot;Music&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Barbara&quot;, &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Transit&quot;&lt;/span>;), which has earned him a good reputation in the international film industry . So he struck while the iron was hot and continued to launch a series of works with the theme of &quot;Elemental Elves&quot;. &quot;Undine&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2020&lt;/span>;) with the theme of the water goddess is the first film in the series; it won the jury award at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival The grand prize of the group, &quot;Red Sky&quot; with the theme of the fire elf Salomanda, is the second installment in this series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By sorting out Petzold’s creative trajectory, we can find some obvious characteristics. His works are highly intellectual, and he will provide almost essay-like explanations around certain specific themes. At the same time, he places great emphasis on the core position occupied by concepts. Under the guidance of such creative concepts, the fate of classical mythological characters overlaps with the situation of modern Germans (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;Phoenix&quot;&lt;/span>;), the plight of the Jews during World War II also collided with the fate of Arab refugees in contemporary Europe (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;Transit&quot;&lt;/span>;), stirring up a wonderful chemical reaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But we also have to point out that although the concept of Petzold&#39;s film is charming, it is slightly rigid in terms of flesh and texture, and lacks some real and perceptible vitality. This problem is particularly exposed in Undine: an attempt to combine a water spirit from classical mythology with the life of a contemporary German industrial diver, which is very interesting on paper, but fails to translate into images In the end, it is easy to fall into the predicament of wildly swinging between the metaphysical and the physical, and end up relying on neither. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Petzold must have realized his mistake in Undine. Therefore, when filming his new work &quot;Red Sky&quot;, he sought a lighter brushstroke: the metaphysical mythological elements are hidden deeper, while the metaphysical daily life is pushed to the foreground. The plot is set during a summer vacation. Leon, a troubled young writer, is invited to his friend Felix&#39;s seaside holiday home to try to finish the novel in a quiet environment while waiting for the publisher&#39;s decision. But during this period of time that should have calmed him down, he passively got acquainted with the beautiful and lively girl Nadia, and her lover Devi who had a close relationship with her. Leon&#39;s heart was stirred up, but the approaching deadline (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Deadline&lt;/span>;) and the burden of intellectuals made him Nadia&#39;s emotions become tangled and twisted, creating a series of comedies and dramas in the lives of four people. At the same time, a wildfire is spreading inland, becoming the disturbing background sound of the entire story. No one knows whether this light vacation will eventually end in raging flames. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like the titles of many of Petzold&#39;s previous films, &quot;Red Sky&quot; is also full of potential. It not only refers to the sky dyed red by wildfires on a concrete level, but also metaphorically alludes to the sexual tension that is about to emerge between the several protagonists, as well as the overwhelming sexual tension in the &quot;Revelation&quot; volume of the New Testament. Apocalyptic scene. But the film&#39;s story ultimately fails to live up to the full potential of its title. The huge destructive power of wildfires is almost wiped out by a shot of wild boars running in the forest and the off-screen deaths of two supporting characters; and &quot;Memento mori&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;will die&lt;/span>;)-style death warning also fails to be integrated with the character&#39;s desires. In the final analysis, &quot;Red Sky&quot; still tells the story of a self-centered male protagonist chasing the heroine and awakening during the pursuit. Whether it is his friends, publishers, the fire and death, or even the heroine herself, they seem to be tools that lead him to self-awakening. And there remains a huge gulf between Petzold&#39;s prowess in seductive concept-building and what can only be described as a barely above-average narrative articulation. Red Skies is an improvement over its predecessor, but there&#39;s a gap that still needs to be filled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Zh1Vsz896cTN46UvPe0CjDwWeYJydBhnwEzqf2Qb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;679&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Zh1Vsz896cTN46UvPe0CjDwWeYJydBhnwEzqf2Qb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250590&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Hide And the master of melodrama&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with his meek performance in narrative and expression, Petzold&#39;s ability to write romantic relationships and set off the love atmosphere is outstanding. It is easy to forget that Germans have always been famous for their seriousness, whether they are romantic poets like Goethe and Holderlin or melodrama masters like Douglas Sirk and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. He grew up nourished by the Rhine River. To a certain extent, Petzold is also the heir to the romantic mantle of his predecessors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the valuable thing about Petzold is that his writing about love relationships not only has a German-style desperate romance, but also has a subtle temperament that is rare among European and American creators. Petzold&#39;s male protagonists always seem to be more interested in the souls of their admirers than in possessing their bodies, but they are always so shy and clumsy in their pursuit of each other that The end of happiness seems forever out of reach. In contrast, Petzold&#39;s heroines are always as erratic as wandering spirits, unable to be defined or captured. They are free souls who make no secret of their feelings for the person they love, but they always refuse to be defined as immutable symbols and never become objects. Therefore, in Petzold&#39;s film, the dislocation game of chasing and dodging has been going on. This game seems to have been going on since the birth of men and women, and it will continue until the end of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Red Sky&quot;, the setting of summer vacation and country holiday house, the lighter tone compared with Petzold&#39;s previous works, and the characters&#39; artistic and intellectual atmosphere The conversation will more or less remind us of those in Eric Rohmer&#39;s films, those satirical ridicules of hesitant straight men with good intentions, and those under the comedic tone, which are emotionless and emotionless. perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the other hand, Petzold’s talent for creating romantic situations, his intense love for female characters, and the emotional relationships between male and female characters in his films become more intense because of evasion and restraint. , will remind people of another film master who is good at creating romantic atmosphere-Wong Kar-wai. Perhaps Paula Bell, the actress in &quot;Transit&quot;, &quot;Undine&quot; and &quot;Red Sky&quot;, has quietly become Petzold&#39;s Maggie Cheung. The plots of these movies may soon disappear from our minds, but Paula Bell&#39;s bright smile and red dress will remain in our memories for a long time. Through the male director&#39;s way, we cannot fully understand what they mean. Thoughts and feelings, but still (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;or - precisely because of this&lt;/span>;) eyes full of admiration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[餐厅员工发顾客打娃视频后赔1万离职，警方如此调解令人费解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257400]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to reports, on September 19, a Western restaurant stopped a mother from beating her daughter and posted the relevant video online. The employee, Mr. Jiang, resigned and left Changsha after compensating the other party 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The surveillance video that Mr. Jiang previously posted online showed that the woman involved, Hu, was holding a shopping bag and yelling at the little girl. Later, she took her child to the Western restaurant where Mr. Jiang worked and asked her child to explain to her the process of causing trouble. At this moment, Hu lost control. He put down the shopping bag in his hand, lifted the chair next to him and tried to hit the girl. Mr. Jiang and his colleagues stepped forward to stop him. A nearby merchant revealed in an interview with a reporter from Hunan TV that when the mother and daughter passed by his store, the girl suddenly fell down and the ice cream in her hand spilled on the floor, causing her clothes to be stained. Immediately, Hu lost control of his emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Jiang said that after the incident, Hu came to the restaurant many times, saying that he should not have spread the video online and threatened to die in the restaurant. After mediation by the local police station, Mr. Jiang paid the other party 10,000 yuan in compensation for mental losses and medical expenses, and then voluntarily submitted his resignation to his boss. Netizens expressed: &quot;Those who hit people are fine, but those who stopped them will be punished&quot;, &quot;I really feel sorry for this doll when I see this video&quot;, and some netizens said, &quot;It&#39;s really chilling.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The restaurant employee got into trouble when he prevented the woman Hu from beating her daughter in public and uploading the video to the Internet. This matter involves many aspects, including domestic violence, public supervision, privacy rights and law enforcement issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it must be clear that Hu’s behavior of beating his daughter in public is a typical act of domestic violence. It not only violates public order and good customs, but also violates relevant laws. According to Article 2 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China, domestic violence refers to physical, mental and other violations committed by family members in the form of beating, binding, mutilation, restriction of personal freedom, regular verbal abuse, and intimidation. Article 5 stipulates that minors, the elderly, disabled people, pregnant and lactating women, and seriously ill patients who suffer domestic violence shall be given special protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is the duty of the police station to deal with Hu’s illegal behavior as soon as possible. Article 33 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China stipulates that if the perpetrator commits domestic violence and constitutes a violation of public security management, he shall be subject to public security management penalties in accordance with the law. It can be seen that when parents beat their children, law enforcement agencies cannot turn a blind eye on the grounds that &quot;honest officials cannot handle household matters.&quot; In this incident, Hu publicly beat his daughter, which caused a very bad public perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the restaurant employee Mr. Jiang’s behavior of publishing the video, from a legal perspective, he did not infringe on Hu’s portrait rights. Because this is an exposure of illegal activities in public places, Mr. Jiang is exercising the citizen’s right to supervise. Article 1020 of the Civil Code stipulates that the following acts may be reasonably carried out without the consent of the portrait right holder: other acts of making, using, or disclosing the portrait of the portrait right holder in order to safeguard public interests or the legitimate rights and interests of the portrait right holder. By exposing his video, Mr. Jiang obviously hopes to draw social attention to the phenomenon of domestic violence and jointly protect the rights of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a step back, even if Hu believes that his rights and interests have been violated, he should protect his rights and interests through legal means such as litigation, rather than through improper means such as making trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu made trouble in the restaurant many times. However, the police station did not hold him accountable. Instead, through mediation, Mr. Jiang was asked to compensate 10,000 yuan for mental damages and medical expenses. This move not only chilled Mr. Jiang&#39;s heart, but also sent a wrong signal: If illegal acts can be resolved through mediation, or even reverse compensation can be obtained, wouldn&#39;t it condone more people&#39;s willful behavior? In this way, the law loses its majesty and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a law enforcement agency, it should be based on the law, focus on protecting the rights and interests of minors and the courageous behavior of citizens, and have zero tolerance for illegal activities, so as to form a legal deterrent and guide social atmosphere. Improve the quality of citizens through legal education. Regrettably, the police station allowed the parties’ emotions to influence the outcome of the case, acquiescing to the woman’s behavior of “getting more and more unreasonable”. Such mediation is inconsistent with legal principles. Netizens generally questioned this mediation and expressed their simple view of justice. Law enforcement agencies should re-investigate the matter and hold the offenders accountable, rather than letting those who bravely act for justice lose money and jobs. Only in this way can people&#39;s faith in judicial authority not be damaged. After all, the majesty and credibility of the law are often reflected in the daily actions of law enforcers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti , Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[如果你导弹打得不够准，是因为你人靠得不够近丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257374]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdvQehIu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdv QehIu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251331&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 13, 2023, Sevastopol, Crimea region, Smoke billowed out from the attacked shipyard &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Ukrainian news said that the Ukrainian military In the early morning of September 13, 2023, 10 missiles and 3 unmanned boats launched an attack on the Sevastopol military base in the Crimean Peninsula, causing a fire at the Sevastopol Shipyard and two ships under repair were damaged. The losses include the Russian Black Sea Fleet&#39;s Ropcha-class landing ship &quot;Minsk&quot; and the Kilo-class diesel-powered submarine &quot;Rostov-on-Don&quot; which cost up to US$300 million and was commissioned in 2014. Rostov-on-Don). Satellite images of the scene showed that the two ships were severely damaged and were extremely difficult and expensive to repair. Considering that such a project was difficult to complete under the wartime system, they basically had to be scrapped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russia also admitted that it was attacked by Ukrainian missiles and that some ships were damaged. The situation announced by both sides basically confirmed the results of this attack. This is the largest loss suffered by the Black Sea Fleet since the sinking of the flagship Moskva after the war between Russia and Ukraine. It also sets a record for the first time in history that a submarine is hit by a missile. What’s even more amazing is that just two days after this attack, Ukraine announced that it had used missiles and drones to attack the S-400 air defense missile system on the Crimean Peninsula. This system has always been considered the strongest in Russia. Currently in active air defense weapons, Turkey even had tense relations with the United States and NATO in order to purchase this system. This time, it was beheaded by Ukraine behind enemy lines in actual combat, which was shocking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This round of continuous attacks with a combination of punches is obviously not the result of an accident, but a joint military operation between the Ukrainian intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense, in which the actions of the Ukrainian special forces can be said to be indispensable. without. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before launching the missile attack, that is, on September 11, the Ukrainian intelligence agency announced that the special forces had successfully seized two offshore oil and gas drilling platforms in the Black Sea and successfully removed Russian equipment from the platforms. military installations. The map shows that the two platforms captured by the Ukrainian special forces are about fifty kilometers away from the Crimean coastline. The Russian army has set up air and sea warning radars on them to control the Black Sea area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This attack did not attract much attention from domestic public opinion. Some media even believed that it was a political show after Ukraine’s counterattack failed, because the battle to seize the two platforms was not fierce and not too big. military value. However, in my opinion, the battle to seize the sea platform is the prelude to this attack, because Ukraine does not have stealth fighter equipment that can penetrate the enemy&#39;s air defense network, so it must try to shorten the reaction time of the opponent&#39;s air defense weapons, and these two This platform happens to be Russia&#39;s peripheral observation point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the start of the 2003 Iraq War, the U.S. military used special forces to successfully seize three Iraqi offshore drilling platforms in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, it is to prevent Iraq from dumping oil into the Persian Gulf and polluting the environment like it did during the Gulf War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the operation that year, in addition to the British and American special forces, the Polish Thunder Special Task Force also assumed the offensive mission of a platform. This kind of battle to seize maritime platforms is referred to as VBSS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Visit, board, search and seize&lt;/span>;) in the field of special operations. VBSS The mission is often only accomplished by elite maritime special operations units. The complexity of such operations lies in the fact that it involves combat maneuvers from underwater to the surface, and also includes extremely close indoor combat. It not only requires a large amount of pre-war reconnaissance, but also requires a large amount of targeted actual combat training by operational units before they can make up their minds to implement it. This kind of maritime point-taking operation generally cannot be just a political statement mission, because the risks and costs are too high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the missile attack two days later that Ukraine&#39;s action to seize the Black Sea drilling platform is only part of its huge action plan. In fact, the follow-up actions are the key to victory. After the submarine and landing ship were attacked by missiles, Ukraine launched a missile attack one day later. The battle rhythm seemed not compact enough. But in fact, the U.S. special forces did not delay after seizing the platform. Another attack team quietly landed on the Crimean Peninsula under the cover of night, approached the submarines and landing ships in the shipyard, and used thermal imaging Shoot it from multiple angles. After the attack, these latent special operations personnel conducted reconnaissance and assessment of the bombing effects before quietly withdrawing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because air-launched missile attacks involve issues with the angle of incidence, it is necessary to construct a three-dimensional image of the target, and the inspection needs to confirm its radar information or thermal imaging information, all of which require multi-angle technical reconnaissance. The United States may be able to rely on its powerful satellite and reconnaissance aircraft platforms for reconnaissance. For Ukraine, which lacks technical reconnaissance means, using special forces or covert operators to conduct close reconnaissance is a good alternative. And even for a country like the United States with strong technical reconnaissance capabilities, close-in reconnaissance by special forces is still one of the optional methods. For example, during the Gulf War, the United States sent multiple special operations teams into Iraq in order to find Iraqi Scud missiles. Conduct close reconnaissance from the rear. In addition, for collecting the signal characteristics of enemy air defense weapons, deploying special operations personnel for close detection is also a very feasible method, because with only a set of signal receivers, these lurking personnel can obtain the spectrum information of surrounding warning radars for a long time , and can also obtain more comprehensive signal intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe that the emergence of drones can replace special operations personnel, but in fact it is people, not machines, who win wars. Only when the quality of people matches technical means can we defeat powerful opponents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 20:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10人遇难，强龙卷风突袭江苏后，救灾与保险赔付正进行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257406]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/d0f40bac84.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d0f40bac84. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, the scene of the tornado disaster in Nancai Township, Suqian City.

He was picked up by the wind and fell to the other side of the road. At that time, a wrist-thick main cable suddenly fell down on the street, bursting into flames, and everyone was afraid of being electrocuted. &quot;I was so frightened at that moment.&quot; Luo Qi said that it was the first time in more than 30 years that she had seen such a violent tornado. The stall owner&#39;s wife kept asking for help, but no one dared to rescue her. Later, the police cordoned off the scene, and the cables were still on fire after the power was artificially cut off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Liyuan Road, which intersects with South Street, Li Peng opened a small supermarket.

Relatively speaking, tornadoes occur more frequently in Yancheng City. The private rescue teams along the Jiangsu coast have conducted targeted training on thunderstorms and hurricanes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 6 pm on the 19th, 13 members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team rushed to Nancai Township, Economic Development Zone.

Daughter Chen Guo said that the roof of her parents&#39; house had just been renovated a few days ago, and they spent three to four thousand yuan to replace it with new tiles. Unexpectedly, the tornado ripped through most of the roof, and the electrical appliances in the house were also soaked in rain all night. Fortunately, the corridor was made of hard cement boards, so the two old men laid several layers of quilts on the corridor and spent the night. On September 20, my uncle, who was in his seventies, came to help repair the roof. I didn’t know when it would be repaired. Someone from the village registered the loss of the house, but the old man didn&#39;t know how to subsidize it in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 20, the Suqian Emergency Management Bureau issued a WeChat article stating that it had insured urban and rural residents of Suqian City with public safety urban and rural assistance insurance, which would cover urban and rural housing in Suqian City due to floods and typhoons. Compensation for house losses caused by natural disasters such as landslides, landslides, fires and explosions. The compensation standard is that for urban housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 120,000 yuan/household; for rural housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 40,000 yuan/household. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The underwriter of this project is mainly the Suqian Branch of the People&#39;s Insurance Company of China Co., Ltd. Zheng Xinbo, the company&#39;s contact person, told Southern Weekend reporters that this private housing insurance is purchased by the government, and each household pays 2 yuan. , have been purchasing continuously for many years. After the disaster occurred, they sent more than 30 staff to the villages and towns on the 20th to verify the damage and determine the damage. The first batch of compensation will be completed before the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively speaking, Yancheng City has more experience in dealing with tornadoes. Public information shows that on June 23, 2012, Yancheng &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;>;City&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E9%98%9C%E5% AE%81/871643%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Funing&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text -decoration: none;&quot;>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E5%B0%84%E9%98%B3/871862%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Sheyang&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;An EF4 tornado occurred in some areas, with winds exceeding level 17. 99 people were killed and 846 injured. The local government built the Yancheng Memorial Hall for Fighting the &quot;6.23&quot; Tornado. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Funing County Party Committee Propaganda Department stated that Funing County has also formulated corresponding emergency plans for natural disasters that occur more frequently. After the tornado, the &quot;9.19&quot; Typhoon Emergency Rescue Command was established in the affected town as soon as possible; special teams were arranged to go to each disaster-stricken village to find out the situation, grasp the disaster situation as soon as possible and report it quickly. Four rounds of sifting search and rescue operations were carried out overnight on September 19. In addition, 129 disaster-stricken people were urgently relocated and resettled by staying with relatives and friends, staying in hotels, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiangsu is a tornado-prone area in the country. According to &quot;Jiangsu Meteorology&quot; news, from 1956 to 2015, a total of 109 tornadoes occurred in Jiangsu, with the highest proportion occurring in summer, reaching 79.8%, with an annual average of 1.5. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Jiangsu is prone to tornadoes is that the province has a flat terrain, dense rivers and lakes, and is located in the north-south climate transition zone. Cold and warm air currents frequently meet, which can easily form strong convective weather including tornadoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meteorological experts in the above article said that Jiangsu is usually less prone to tornadoes in mid-to-late September, but recently due to higher temperatures and the influence of the Jianghuai cyclone, relatively strong tornadoes have occurred. dynamic conditions. Against this background, a relatively rare tornado event occurred in Jiangsu on September 19. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 21st, Wang Xiaohua, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory, said in an interview with CCTV that the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory has built a strong convection and strong wind demonstration system from 2021 to 2023. , some preliminary forecast and warning capabilities of tornadoes. In the next step, the meteorological department will use multi-source observation data such as multi-band radar collaborative observation to improve and optimize tornado early warning technology and indicators based on the characteristics of climate change, and further improve forecast and early warning capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Local residents are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[白切鸡寿司走红，年轻人流行的“中餐日作”是真香吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257296]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:30:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[钱锺书回避鲁迅？No，他开启了“悄悄关注”模式]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257339]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B0asgnIe8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; height=&quot;487&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B 0asgnIe8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251595&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From left: Lin Yutang, Lu Xun, Soong Ching Ling, Smedley, Li Peihua (Secretary of Soong Ching Ling) ). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Qian Zhongshu rarely talked about Lu Xun publicly, he could not &quot;avoid&quot; Lu Xun. Crystal once said in &quot;Miscellaneous Notes of Shi Qian&#39;s Throwing Books&quot; that at a symposium, Qian Zhongshu praised Lu Xun&#39;s short stories for being well written, but not suitable for long stories. The most well-known person is Qian Zhongshu&#39;s opening speech at the &quot;Lu Xun and Chinese and Foreign Culture&quot; academic seminar. This article was later published in &quot;Literary Journal&quot; on October 23, 1986, and collected in &quot;The Edge of Life&quot;. In his opening speech, Qian Zhongshu said a few words &quot;as usual&quot; based on people&#39;s &quot;public opinion&quot; of Lu Xun at that time: &quot;Lu Xun was a great man. The greater the figure, the more aspects can be observed; &#39;Chinese and foreign culture&#39; is a big The bigger the topic, the wider the scope of the problems that can occur.&quot; The main spirit of his speech was to hope that everyone can &quot;speak freely without bending the meaning to seek consensus&quot;, and could not see the true evaluation of Lu Xun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Qian Zhongshu and Lu Xun also had a period of time in the same city. In September 1927, Lu Xun left Guangzhou and lived in Shanghai until his death in October 1936. Qian Zhongshu graduated from Tsinghua University in the summer of 1933 and taught at Guanghua University. He began studying at Oxford in the autumn of 1935, so he spent more than two years in Shanghai. However, they were only from the same city, and the two of them had never been seen crossing paths. However, as a later scholar and because of Lu Xun&#39;s huge influence, Qian Zhongshu inevitably had to &quot;encounter&quot; Lu Xun intentionally or unintentionally when writing. &quot;On the Parallel Study of Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu&quot; written by Liu Yukai and &quot;On the Comparative Study of Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu Literature&quot; written by Sui Qing&#39;e have all made comparisons from an academic level. Scholars such as Xie Yong, Wang Peijun, Li Guotao and Qian Zhijun have made comparisons in their writings. There are also elucidations from time to time, and I would like to unearth several examples related to Lu Xun from Qian Zhongshu&#39;s writings, which may fill the gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Besieged City&quot;, Sun Roujia&#39;s uncle and aunt hold important positions in a large cotton factory and have always looked down upon Fang Hongjian. Once, Fang Hongjian and Sun Roujia quarreled again over the arrival of his aunt. When he learned that his aunt wanted to find a position for him in the factory, he jumped up and shouted: &quot;Who wants her to find trouble for me? I can&#39;t even beg for food.&quot; Don&#39;t ask her for it! Isn&#39;t it enough that she has two lackeys, Bobby and you, Sun Roujia? You tell her that Fang Hongjian &#39;has no skills but a very bad temper&#39;, and you won&#39;t be a lackey of a capitalist lackey.&quot; This paragraph of text , immediately reminds people of Lu Xun&#39;s famous article &quot;&quot;Bereaved&quot; and &quot;The Capitalist&#39;s Lacking Lackey&quot; published in 1930, which criticized Liang Shiqiu. Although Qian Zhongshu was studying in Tsinghua University at the time, he would not have missed the articles on the Lu-Liang debate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 84 of the first volume of the Commercial Press&#39;s &quot;Notes of Rong&#39;an Pavilion&quot;, reading the notes of Yue Ke&#39;s &quot;History&quot;, Qian Zhongshu excerpted the following paragraph in Volume 12 and added a note:&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the summer of the 10th year of the reign of Emperor Xizong (Wanyan) of the Jin Dynasty, Long Jian (present) in the Yuzhai Palace, there was a heavy thunderstorm Arrive, break the pillar and go away. Everyone was shocked, thinking it was ominous, and wanted to look at it in disgust. Some people thought that a general amnesty should be granted, so they called Zhang Jun, a bachelor, to draft the imperial edict. Among them are the words &quot;Gu Zi is ignorant&quot; and &quot;Looking at Yu Xiaozi&quot;. The translator did not know the meaning of Tuo Qianchong, so he said: &quot;Han&#39;er is strong in knowledge, and he relies on words to criticize my Lord&#39;s ears.&quot; When asked why, he translated and explained its meaning: &quot;The widowed is lonely and has no relatives; the ignorant is ignorant of human affairs; the eyes are blind; the brat is a child.&quot; He was furious and summoned Jun to question him, but he failed to answer him. , slash (cut) its mouth with a hand sword, and dig it with thorns. I didn&#39;t know that it was translated as &quot;foolishness&quot; or &quot;treachery&quot;. So... According to this, Lu Xun is also the ancestor of literal translation. &quot; (&quot;Notes of Rong&#39;an Pavilion&quot; page 146)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jin Xizong Wanyan Dan was the third emperor of the Jin Dynasty. It is said that he studied under Han Fang before he came to the throne and was able to write poems in Chinese. After he came to the throne, he was particularly diligent in studying Chinese classics. According to this article in the &quot;History of the Emperor&quot;, Wanyan Quan did not seem to be very proficient in Chinese, and the translator could only &quot;literally translate&quot;, taking out of context the commonly used imperial edicts. Formulas such as &quot;Gu Zi is ignorant&quot; and &quot;Xiao Yu Xiaozi&quot; can be &quot;directly interpreted&quot; as cursing the Lord, thus losing the original meaning of &quot;retreating, trusting, and rushing&quot;, and Zhang Jun was convicted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Zhongshu&#39;s note &quot;This is the ancestor of Lu Xun&#39;s literal translation&quot; naturally reminds people of the &quot;Lu-Liang Controversy&quot;. In September 1929, Liang Shiqiu published &quot;On Mr. Lu Xun&#39;s Life&quot; in &quot;Crescent&quot; &quot;Hard Translation&quot;&quot;, Lu Xun refuted it by publishing &quot;&quot;Hard Translation&quot; and &quot;The Class Nature of Literature&quot;&quot; in &quot;Jinya Monthly&quot; in March of the following year. The debate has exceeded the boundaries of translation. As far as translation is concerned, Lu Xun advocated &quot;literal translation&quot; (or &quot;hard translation&quot;), such as the translation of &quot;The Symbol of Depression&quot;, which &quot;is translated sentence by sentence, or even word for word according to the rules&quot;, and its purpose is to &quot;prefer to believe rather than obey.&quot; Qian Zhongshu is obviously familiar with translation However, his views were different from those of Lu Xun, so Qian Zhongshu went on to write:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yu Reading &quot;Shuowen&quot; to the &quot;Kou&quot; part of the 26th word &quot;囮: 译也&quot;, Chang sighs Ji Chang (Editor&#39;s note: refers to Xu Shen), a true saint, foresees Tradutore, traditore! Wang Yuanzhi&#39;s &quot;Little Animals Collection&quot; Volume 14 &quot;Translation Dui&quot; says: &quot;Translation means Yi. It can change one&#39;s mind if it is big, but it can only change one&#39;s words if it is small. &quot;So on and so forth. After liberation, the trend of translating books became more and more popular. They did not know how to make mistakes, but they were eaten alive. Not only were they changed beyond recognition, but their hearts and minds were completely changed. They were the so-called &quot;great translators&quot; in Xun Yuan Dynasty. Gu Tangsheng&#39;s &quot;Records of Zhang Wenxiang&#39;s Shogunate&quot; Juan Xia said: &quot;Chen Lanbin envoy to the United States, one of his attendants, Xu, is not familiar with Western languages. One day, he suddenly picked up the Western Newspaper and seemed to be reading it with gusto. His colleagues asked him strangely. Xu said: I can&#39;t understand the Western Newspaper. I read Zhu Jun&#39;s translation. Also puzzled. If you still don&#39;t understand, it would be better to just read the Western newspaper. &quot;In this way, both this and Zhang Jun&#39;s incident can be used as the motto of today&#39;s translators. (ibid., pp. 146-147)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This note is related to the fact that &quot;after liberation&quot; the translation industry &quot;does not know what to do. Talking about &quot;eating alive&quot; is also a denial of &quot;literal translation&quot;. Regarding translation, what Qian Zhongshu pursues is the realm of &quot;translation&quot;, although &quot;thorough and complete &#39;translation&#39; is an unattainable ideal.&quot; Therefore, Qian Zhongshu pursues In the article, Zhongshu praised Xu Shen (Jianchang) as a &quot;true saint&quot; and said that he could predict that the translation would be &quot;囮&quot; (false) and that the translator (Tradutore) was a traitor (traditore). For details, see &quot;Lin Shu&#39;s Translation&quot; and There are several discussions in &quot;Guan Zhui Bian&quot;. The following part of this article is based on Gu Hongming&#39;s story of Xu reading a Western newspaper, and combined with Zhang Jun&#39;s view, he believes that &quot;all can be used as the motto of today&#39;s translators.&quot; It is humorous without losing irony, which is quite obvious. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s writing style is consistent. The most eye-catching part of the whole note is the note &quot;the ancestor of literal translation&quot; and so on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1920s and 1930s, Lin Yutang was trying to change the &quot;Chinese-style humor&quot; &quot;Joking attitude&quot; to reshape the virtues of gentlemen, so he advocated &quot;humorous literature&quot;. Unexpectedly, it backfired, as Qian Zhongshu criticized in his essay &quot;Joking&quot;: &quot;Since the promotion of humorous literature, joking has become a literati career. &quot;Lin Yutang helped the &quot;current ills&quot; by rescuing &quot;current ills.&quot; The actual effect of &quot;humorous literature&quot; ran counter to its original intention. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Jokes&quot; was inspired by &quot;humorous literature.&quot; As for Lin Yutang&#39;s ideas, Lu Xun In &quot;One Thought and Action&quot;, he once criticized: &quot;Boom, there is no shortage of humor and sketches in the world. &quot; (&quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&quot;, Volume 5, page 473) also pointed out in &quot;Explanation of &quot;Funny&quot;&quot; that humorous literature just gives &quot;slick, frivolous and obscene&quot; the &quot;title of &#39;humor&#39;&quot; (&quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&quot;) &quot;Volume 5, page 342). Some people therefore believe that &quot;Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu really echo each other in their views on promoting humorous literature&quot; (Li Qinye, &quot;Reading &amp;lt;Writing on the Edge of Life&quot;), This statement is specious.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of modern literature, Lu Xun, Lin Yutang and Qian Zhongshu are all famous for their humor. Lu Xun&#39;s humor is like a dagger, with the edge of a scalpel to remove tumors, while Lin Yutang&#39;s humor is The breeze is like a purifier for the soul. At that time, Lin Yutang&#39;s humorous literature was naturally not as powerful as Lu Xun&#39;s essays, so it seemed out of date and was publicly criticized by Lu Xun. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s humor was like cold rain hitting his face, cold and thorny, like a pretender The embarrassment and uneasiness after his soul was exposed. However, although Qian Zhongshu also criticized Lin Yutang, if you compare his &quot;Laughing&quot; with Lin Yutang&#39;s &quot;On Humor&quot;, you will find how similar their views on humor are: Qian Zhongshu It is said that a person who is really humorous will have a &quot;knowing smile&quot; about humor. Lin Yutang said that a calm and distant bystander will give a &quot;knowing smile&quot; to humor; Qian Zhongshu said that humor is &quot;funny and wise&quot; , Lin Yutang said, &quot;wisdom has begun&quot; and &quot;there is humor&quot;; Qian Zhongshu said that humor is &quot;a breath of breath for the dull life&quot;, Lin Yutang said that humor is &quot;a part of life&quot;. Humor originates from wisdom, famous humorists It is not surprising that Qian Zhongshu and Lin Yutang have similar concepts but different expressions and effects. Because of this view of humor, Lin Yutang advocates humorous literature to cultivate the people&#39;s sense of humor and cultivate educated citizens, while Qian Zhongshu believes that true humor can &quot; &quot;Anti-bowing and laughing at oneself&quot; will become a laughing stock once advocated, so he said: &quot;Humor is at most a kind of temperament and can never be labeled as an idea, let alone a profession.&quot; ” It can be seen that although Qian Zhongshu and Lu Xun both criticized the “humorous literature” advocated by Lin Yutang, it cannot be said that their views on humor are of the same origin. On the contrary, Qian Zhongshu and Lin Yutang’s views on humor are “similar to each other.”&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;As a witness and participant in the same literary and artistic trend, although Qian Zhongshu never had direct contact with Lu Xun, it even made people think that he sometimes deliberately &quot;looked sideways&quot; at Lu Xun, and followed the trend to find out the source. If we open the &quot;fog&quot;, we can still see their figures at the same time in major events in the history of modern literature, and then we can see Qian Zhongshu&#39;s consistent indifferent attitude towards Shi Xian, including Lu Xun, &quot;It&#39;s like seeing from flying sand, wheat waves, and ripples &quot;The posture of the wind&quot; (Qian Zhong&#39;s calligraphy). (The original title of this article was &quot;The posture of the wind&quot;, the current title was proposed by the editor)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“4.2千年事件”：地球大降温，华夏新生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257310]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At the beginning of this century, with the advancement of molecular biology, we were able to explore the origin of rice through gene testing - detection The results show that cultivated rice was first domesticated in the Yangtze River Basin about 13,500 to 8.2 thousand years ago, and then spread to Southeast Asia and South Asia. After hybridizing with wild indica rice in South Asia, cultivated indica rice was produced and returned to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the process of studying the origin of rice, genetic testing has brought questions. Scholars suddenly discovered that there are many strange things about its spread time: after rice was domesticated, it stayed in China for thousands of years and did not spread outside. However, around 4.2 to 4,000 years ago, almost at the same time, rice suddenly appeared on the Japanese Islands, the Korean Peninsula, the Philippines, Indo-China Peninsula and the South Asian subcontinent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This makes people wonder: What happened more than four thousand years ago? ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from ancient Chinese books, 4,000 years ago was around the time when the Xia Dynasty was established. It is said that after Emperor Yu controlled the floods, he sent envoys to measure &quot;the whole world&quot; and finally calculated that the distance from east to west and north to south of the earth was 233,500 miles and 75 steps. Although this is just a myth in the &quot;Book of Mountains and Seas&quot;, mythical stories often have prototypes: Maybe after Dayu established the Xia Dynasty, he sent envoys to explore the unknown world and spread rice to surrounding countries by the way? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, from an archaeological perspective, the world between 4.2 and 4,000 years ago was suffering unprecedented disasters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you pay attention to Chinese archeology, you may have heard the saying &quot;a sky full of stars&quot;, which describes ancient civilizations before the Xia Dynasty: China between 5000 and 4300 years ago was full of archaeological sites. There are Hongshan in the western Liao River basin and Longshan in the Yellow River basin. These two are already city-state civilizations; in the Yangtze River basin there are Liangzhu and Shijiahe, both of which have entered dynastic politics. At that time, the earth was in the famous &quot;Holocene Warm Period&quot;. The humid and warm climate allowed civilizations all over the world to thrive. Even the deserts of Central Asia and the Sahara Desert of Africa were livable places with widespread forests and lakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, by 4.2 to 4,000 years ago, the civilizations in the three major river basins all collapsed, and the entire land of China fell into chaos:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cities in Shijiahe and Liangzhu in the Yangtze River Basin collapsed one after another Destroyed and abandoned, the territory shrank sharply. By 3800 years ago, the original core area had almost become a no-man&#39;s land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many settlements in the Xiliao River Basin disappeared completely, and the population was directly replaced: genetic testing found that the Xiajiadian lower-class culture that later emerged in the local area had no genetic connection with the previous residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yellow River Basin is also full of victims: Archeology shows that the number of settlements in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River decreased by nearly 90% during this catastrophe, and the population may only be 1/10 of its original size. The exquisite and brilliant Longshan black pottery disappeared, and it was not until more than a hundred years later that a very rough gray pottery culture appeared - which means that the original civilization, the original knowledge and technology inheritance were also lost in this catastrophe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the origin of this catastrophe, the most common hypothesis is the Great Flood: Based on archaeological evidence, some scholars speculate that about 3920 years ago, a huge barrier lake formed in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, blocking the Yellow River. nearly 9 months. Afterwards, the barrier lake burst its banks, and about 16 billion cubic meters of lake water poured down instantly. The flood almost flattened the entire Yellow River Basin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this hypothesis has some truth, it cannot explain the great collapse that also occurred in the Yangtze River Basin during the same period - in fact, not only the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, but also the whole world experienced a great collapse of civilization at that time. This was obviously a Climate disasters affecting the world:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The forests and Saharan lakes in Central Asia disappeared, and the great desert was born; in the Nile River Basin of North Africa, the early dynasty that had flourished for five hundred years came to an abrupt end, severe drought led to the collapse of agriculture, and Egypt fell into The century-long famine and civil strife is known to history as the &quot;First Intermediate Period&quot;; in the two river basins of West Asia, the Akkadian Empire completed its unification for the first time. A large amount of farmland was abandoned and was immediately attacked by foreign barbarians; in Central and Northern Europe, The cooling made the climate cold and humid, leading to the great migration of many ethnic groups...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This climate catastrophe is now called the &quot;4.2 Millennium Event&quot;, a catastrophe that can be called the end of civilization. . The superposition of turbulent ocean currents, super volcanic eruptions and El Niño may be the culprits of this natural disaster. The 4.2 millennium event manifested itself differently in different regions. Some places experienced severe droughts, while others experienced floods, but generally speaking, major cooling occurred. In fact, this event occurred from the end of the &quot;Younger Dryas Little Ice Age&quot; until the end of the Little Ice Age. Today, humanity has experienced the most severe cooling. The temperature in many places has never returned to the level of the Holocene Warm Period, and the good days of comfort and warmth are gone forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, it was the 4.2 Thousand Years Incident that exterminated the ancestors of the Western Liao River, severely damaged the ancient city-states of the Yellow River, and destroyed the two ancient dynasties in the Yangtze River Basin. Agriculture collapsed, famine was rampant, and mourning was widespread. In just a few decades or even a few years, 90% of the population has been lost. This is a doomsday scene that we today cannot imagine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The few survivors in South China, namely the ancient farmers of the Yangtze River and their descendants, had to take their rice seeds with them and flee in search of new land that could barely be cultivated. They crossed the sea to the east and reached the Korean Peninsula and Japan, becoming the ancestors of Koreans and Japanese immigrants; they reached the Philippines to the south and became the first stop for the Austronesian people to conquer the Pacific; they crossed the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the west and reached the Indochina Peninsula and India. , and the local hunter indigenous people, merged to form the Mon-Khmer language family (South Asian language family)...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the saying goes, misfortunes and blessings depend on each other, and new life is also born in the doomsday disaster. After the catastrophe, China bid farewell to the &quot;starry sky&quot; and began to unite: the ancestors of South China (ancient Yangtze farmers) who fled famine, and another group arrived in the northern Central Plains. Here they met the ancient farmers of the Yellow River who had also fled here. The two integrated and communicated to build a new home together - the north and south areas of Songshan Mountain where Erlitou in Henan is located were not prominent during the Holocene warm period, with only some scattered small settlements.
