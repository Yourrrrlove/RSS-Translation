But recently, Ralph Lauren, one of the three treasures of the middle class, has begun to lose its sales. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The financial report for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 shows that as of July 2023, Ralph Lauren’s sales increased by only 0.4% compared with the same period last year. North America performed poorly, with revenue down 10%, and growth in the European market also slowed. Overall, the performance in the past two years has been slightly weak. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Then the question is, as a classic representative of &quot;rich style&quot;, Ralph Lauren was once considered a must-have for the middle class. How did the miracle of Ralph Lauren&#39;s rise be explained? Created? How did it gradually come down from the altar? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Ralph Lauren and Old Money Style&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1967, Ralph Lauren was founded by Ralph Lauren was founded in the United States and is positioned as a designer brand full of American classics and British style. In the early days, by sponsoring popular films such as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; Ralph Lauren successfully bound itself to the &quot;American Dream.&quot; In countless American literature, &quot;models dressed like Ralph Lauren&quot; ” is another expression of becoming a superior person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The classic polo logo and stand-up collar Polo shirt have conquered many middle-aged men, unified the aesthetics of elite men around the world, and established a firm foothold in their cloakrooms. Ralph Lauren&#39;s Polo shirt is as classic as jeans are to Reeves, and down jackets are to Bosideng. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, long-lasting Ralph Lauren classic items such as cable-knit sweaters and Oxford cloth shirts are popular all year round, which can be said to be an effortless way to look old money. A styling tool that sells well all over the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Speaking of the &quot;old money style&quot; that made Ralph Lauren out of the industry, why are the new middle class so attracted to it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; &quot;Old money&quot; is a concept opposite to the &quot;new middle class&quot;. They are often people who were born in Rome and have been rich for several generations. They are known as the royal family. Most of them are nobles or wealthy businessmen, and they are in a class that is beyond the reach of ordinary people. And their dressing sense shows distinctive characteristics. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The overall style is mostly basic, with silhouette-based clothing styles, classic and timeless designs, brand logos that are not deliberately displayed, and fabrics that look expensive. What matters is high-end and quality. The happiness of rich people is so unpretentious and boring. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The beauty of &quot;old money style&quot; is not piled up, nor is it created by luxury goods, but is enduring after time, calm retro and A solemn elegance, noble and unassuming, low-key but deeply rooted in people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As Paul Fussell said as early as the 1980s in his sociological work &quot;Style: Social Class and Lifestyle&quot;: In appearance, housing , consumption, leisure, furnishings, spiritual life, language and other aspects of realization will reflect different social levels. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Because machine-made consumer products are so perfect that their high-profile and cheapness can be recognized at a glance, and colors with grayscale components that deviate from the machine have become the center of attention. The favor of the upper class. “The softer and darker the color, the more classy it is.” “Low-key is a common tendency.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The behavior of being covered in luxury goods with logos, wanting to wear the most valuable possessions on your body, and showing off your money and power to others is what the old money do. Disdainful, with the aura of rich people and nouveau riche, too exaggerated and flashy, and appearing to be using too much force. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The unified and harmonious color system, clean and simple clothes, on the contrary, look noble and elegant, with a natural sense of relaxation, and show off effortlessly. sense of fashion. This is the essence of old money style, which is simple and low-key, but has texture and looks full of nobility without any effort. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ralph Lauren is at the forefront of this old money trend. At first glance, it looks ordinary among the crowd, but at a closer look, the brand&#39;s logo reveals its identity and status. It is conveyed in a low-key yet high-profile way, perfectly capturing the middle-aged people&#39;s preference for high-end brands. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Relying on its close ties with the &quot;old money style&quot;, Ralph Lauren successfully captured the American elite, and then embarked on a journey of global expansion, without exception. Let China&#39;s middle class compete for it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/510edbfc3b41bdcca5acf9dfc0526a7d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1349&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/510edbfc3b41bdcca5acf9dfc0526a7d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257145 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>; The three treasures of the middle class cannot be loved by young people? &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the 2007 domestic drama &quot;Struggle&quot;, Tong Dawei wore a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt, which brought this American elite brand into the eyes of a wider range of Chinese people. Since then, Ralph Lauren has begun its own golden age. Through the offline agency model, it has spread all over the country and achieved rapid expansion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, success is also a failure. A large number of stores introduced low-end lines in order to reduce sales, which lowered the brand level. Frequent discounts destroyed consumer trust, and counterfeit goods The proliferation of it on the streets has also caused the brand image to plummet. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ralph Lauren’s financial reports have changed from the previous highs to continuous declines, and ushered in the darkest moment in 2021. Compared with the peak, revenue fell by 40%. Only 4.4 billion yuan. And due to the impact of the epidemic, half of China’s offline stores have been closed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After this, Ralph Lauren began drastic reforms, completely transforming the Chinese market into direct sales, and began high-end and digital transformation. Marketing focuses on KOL and social media, and also launches younger sub-brands. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Nowadays, the trend of &quot;how to dress like a rich girl&quot; is popular among Generation Z. The makeup and clothing of rich girls are flooding the social media at home and abroad, attracting attention. There are many imitators. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After being immune to the dopamine style, sweet-cool-girl style, and Y2K style, the reincarnation of fashion has returned to the &quot;old money style&quot; style, and young people have begun to get involved. The nostalgic complex of &quot;old money style&quot; has the ultimate pursuit of making oneself dress more luxurious, hoping that one can create a low-key, refined and elegant image to the outside world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a result, Ralph Lauren has gradually begun to win over young people from harvesting the middle-aged three treasures of the middle class. It is worth thinking about that the short-term preference of young people does not make Ralph Lauren confident. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Essentially, &quot;old money style&quot; is also a fresh trend. Young people are yearning for another kind of life even though they can&#39;t get it. They can feel it through their outfits. The world of &quot;old money&quot; is a feasible strategy. However, after trying it, they often lose long-term interest, stop trying it and fall in love with it, and the late wavers rush to the next fashion trend non-stop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Once a representative of the old money style, Ralph Lauren was sought after as a must-have item. However, when the &quot;old money style&quot; lost its popularity, the price increased by 80% in five years. Young people just can’t fall in love with Ralph Lauren. After all, in today&#39;s risk society, young people pursue stability more and are less arbitrary and more rational in spending money. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Basic Polo shirts, which can easily cost three to four thousand a piece, are really hard to get rid of. At this time, I look back and see that the UNIQLO co-branded models and MUJI are really good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When the current trend of &quot;no money&quot; begins, and consumption downgrades are accompanied by clothing downgrades, we don&#39;t know how long Ralph Lauren will remain popular in China. What is certain is that &quot;the North Face team was all members last year, the Birdman team was last year, and the Ralph Lauren team is this year.&quot; In the dictionary of fashion, nothing is immortal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Outfitting is not only a style, but also an expression of personality, so Ralph Lauren is just a symbol. Young people don’t care which brand this symbol is embodied by. , the point is, a way of thinking and attitude towards life that is not influenced by trends. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[毕业生就业难，企业用工荒，创新国际化办学可破就业“悖论”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260104]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;January 29, 2023, Haining, Zhejiang, on the production line of a company.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Obviously companies are in short supply of people, why can&#39;t college graduates find jobs?&quot; October 30, 2023, in Zhejiang At the third &quot;Zhejiang University Oriental Forum Haining Sub-Forum&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Forum&quot;) held in Haining City, Zhejiang Province, Chen Lijun, a professor at the School of Public Administration of Zhejiang University, raised a &quot;paradox&quot; about employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After analyzing millions of employment data of global college graduates on LinkedIn China (LinkedIn), Chen Lijun found that the employment data of the top 100 college graduates in the world&#39;s QS rankings The first-time employment rate (the number of people who choose to work after their first graduation) is close to 80%. In China&#39;s leading universities, this figure is close to 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Lijun believes that an important reason for the emergence of the &quot;paradox&quot; is the disconnect between the talent chain and the education chain. &quot;The talents cultivated by schools are not the talents that enterprises need.&quot; , the industrial chain is disconnected from the talent chain, causing employment difficulties and labor shortages to coexist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the county economy, the problem of connecting high-end talents and enterprises may be more serious. Significantly. In Haining, where the forum was held, one local solution was to introduce educational resources. As early as 2013, the Haining Municipal Government reached a cooperation with Zhejiang University and introduced Zhejiang University International College. The goal of the cooperation between the two parties is to establish an international cooperative education model area with the Haining campus of Zhejiang University International College as the main body and linking the entire Haining area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, Zhejiang Haining International Campus has been recruiting students for seven years. Wang Yiming, executive deputy mayor of Haining City, proposed at the forum that the cooperation between Zhejiang University and Haining is &quot;gradually getting better.&quot; &quot;The integration of schools and places, the integration of science and technology, and the integration of industries are getting deeper and deeper, and supporting talent and employment services are also keeping up,&quot; but he also admitted that &quot;it is still difficult to introduce and retain talents.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Innovative international education&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Haining is a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province, adjacent to the provincial capital Hangzhou and only more than 100 kilometers away from Shanghai. It was once known as the &quot;Leather Capital&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The issue of human resources is a prominent issue in county development.&quot; Professor Wu Jiebing of the School of Public Administration of Zhejiang University introduced at the seminar that before 2010, he had After conducting research on the leather industry in Haining, companies reported that “it is difficult to attract undergraduate graduates from a prestigious university.” More graduates chose to stay in Shanghai or Hangzhou, where companies have R&amp;D centers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The problem facing Haining is how to gather talents and innovate and develop high-tech industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was also around 2010 that Chinese universities launched a wave of innovative international education. Duke Kunshan University, New York University Shanghai, Wenzhou-Kean University and other Sino-foreign cooperative universities have been approved for establishment. Interestingly, combined with the previous University of Nottingham Ningbo and Xi&#39;an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, the economically developed Yangtze River Delta region has concentrated half of the Sino-foreign joint universities with independent legal personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2013, Zhejiang University reached a cooperation with the Haining Municipal Government, and the school’s International Union College settled in Haining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;International education is closely related to local economic development needs. After analyzing provincial panel data from 1997 to 2019, Li Fengliang, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Tsinghua University, found that whether it was the number of Sino-foreign cooperative education institutions or the number of projects, there was a significant positive correlation between the scale of Sino-foreign cooperative education and the level of economic development. This shows that the expansion of education opening to the outside world can promote the improvement of economic development levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2016, Zhejiang University Haining International Campus officially opened. At the end of the same year, Haining decided to build a new science and technology city based on Zhejiang Haining International Campus, focusing on the three industries of pan-semiconductor, life and health, and modern service industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some scholars once pointed out that international education is a double-edged sword. Hong Chengwen, executive deputy director of the Institute of Higher Education of Beijing Normal University, once compared decorating a house to China. He believes that the internationalization of education is to decorate his own home with the best materials, but the ultimate goal of internationalization of education should be &quot;how to serve other people&#39;s houses and be a house designer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qu Lijuan, deputy dean of Zhejiang Haining International Campus, said, &quot;The main task of Zhejiang Haining International Campus is to introduce advanced school running concepts, education models and investment mechanisms. The International Union College has established extensive links with world-class academics, and then empowers local economic development through education, technology, and talents, and the corresponding transformation of scientific and technological achievements must be completed locally.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot; On October 30, 2023, Haining, Zhejiang, the third &quot;Zhejiang University Oriental Forum Haining Sub-forum&quot; roundtable meeting, Chen Lijun, professor of School of Public Administration, Zhejiang University.

(Interviewee/picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to retain graduates&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the forum, Chen Lijun threw out the question about employment to the participants &quot;Paradox&quot;: On the one hand, college graduates cannot find jobs, and millions of people are going to &quot;take public exams&quot;; on the other hand, companies in the transformation and upgrading period cannot recruit urgently needed talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She believes that the simultaneous emergence of &quot;employment difficulties&quot; and &quot;labor shortages&quot; reflects the disconnect between the talent chain and the industrial chain. &quot;Companies are too short of people.&quot; , I participated in a talent symposium in Hangzhou before, and a company said that there is no shortage of designers, but senior technicians, and they are ready to go to South Africa to introduce them. High-skilled talents (cannot be recruited) should be said between education and the industrial chain The disconnect between them is already serious.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, there is also a disconnect between the education chain and the innovation chain. &quot;The conversion rate of scientific and technological achievements in our domestic universities is only about 6%,&quot; Chen Lijun pointed out, &quot;There are &#39;two skins&#39; between many university campuses and industrial parks.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In our country, the agglomeration between various innovation elements is still There are certain problems.&quot; Chen Lijun mentioned that a very important feature of global science and technology innovation centers is the high concentration and integration of various innovation elements, including universities, scientific research institutes, enterprises, and various intermediary agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How to solve the integration problem among the talent chain, industry chain, education chain, and innovation chain (referred to as the &quot;four chains&quot;)? Chen Lijun pointed out that one way is to deploy innovation and industrial chains around the talent chain, such as the cooperation model between Zhejiang University and Haining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Wang Yiming&#39;s view, talents are the media between the education chain, the industrial chain, and the innovation chain. He introduced that the campus-site cooperation between Haining and Zhejiang University has begun to bear fruit. “In terms of campus-site integration, we have established a campus-site construction committee and an international education cooperation office, and established a science and technology innovation fund for talents to provide institutional and design guarantees. ; In terms of scientific and technological innovation integration, the Hangzhou Bay North Wing Science and Technology Innovation Hub is under construction and is expected to be initially formed in 2025; in terms of industrial integration, we have built 8 industry-education centers with Zhejiang University; in terms of employment support for talents, we have built a new one around the campus international schools and international hotels.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Can innovative international education retain talents and solve the employment paradox? According to data released by the International Union College of Zhejiang University, the further study rate of the college’s first three graduates reached 89.7%, and the overseas further study rate reached 66.2%. Wang Yiming mentioned that it is still difficult to introduce and retain talents. &quot;When will so many of our students for further studies come back? If they can come back to China, it will be the result of successful technological transformation, but what we have seen so far is not very good.&quot; &quot;More.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The related background is that after a wave of terminations of Sino-foreign cooperative education institutions and projects around 2018, international education has picked up. According to data released by the Sino-foreign cooperative education supervision information platform, as of the end of May 2022, there are more than 1,300 Sino-foreign cooperative education institutions and projects operating at undergraduate and above levels in ordinary colleges and universities across the country, with more than 700,000 students enrolled. Judging from the scale distribution of provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) within the country, except for Tibet, the other 30 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) have opened different types of Sino-foreign cooperative schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;(Retaining) international talents is not only a shortcoming of Zhejiang Province, but also a shortcoming of the entire China.&quot; Chen Lijun said that studying abroad is a global talent flow The most important way, judging from the existing data, is that 50% of people in China&#39;s advantaged universities want to further their studies, and 70% of them choose to go abroad. In terms of return-to-return ratio, China only ranks 100th in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Yiming admitted frankly that the breadth and depth of cooperation between the two parties need to be further deepened in the future. He revealed, &quot;The new round of cooperation will invest 10 billion to provide elements for talents. Guarantee, how to actively cultivate innovation (talents) in the future is a test of the capabilities and level of Haining Municipal Government.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[佳木斯体育馆坍塌背后：建设单位多次中标市政工程，涉事广场系省级重点项目]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260102]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 11:21:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/07/FL9ZJRTyvyLXtiDcUFkgyB4RAlS5XKsule9kZFXn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; ​​height=&quot;338&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/FL9ZJRTyvyLXtiDcUFkgyB4RAlS5XKsule9kZ FXn. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257226&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yuecheng Plaza. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Huanan County People&#39;s Government Website/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than four months after the roof collapse of the gymnasium of No. 34 Middle School in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province, the tragedy happened again , the roof of Jiamusihua Nanyuecheng Stadium, 600 kilometers away, also collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a notice from the Huanan County Government, around 19:20 on November 6, 2023, a partial collapse occurred in the Yuecheng Gymnasium in Hunan County, Jiamusi City. It was initially confirmed at the scene that three people were trapped in the gymnasium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the time of the Qiqihar incident, there had been heavy rains for several days. In this incident, more than 15 mm of snow fell in Hunan County for 6 consecutive hours, and a red warning for heavy snowfall was issued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice showed that the Yuecheng Gymnasium where the incident occurred was a two-story frame structure with a construction area of ​​about 2,000 square meters. The collapse location was the basketball area on the second floor on the west side, with the collapsed area of ​​about 500 square meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are three venues in this gymnasium. The collapsed basketball hall, a table tennis hall on the first floor, and a children&#39;s physical training hall on the second floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhicheng is the owner of this children&#39;s physical training gym. He told Southern Weekend reporters that it happened to be a rest day for the gym and was used for cleaning and cleaning. There was no one in the gym where he was when the incident occurred. The basketball court and table tennis hall on the first floor should be open for normal business. Under normal circumstances, they will not close until 9 p.m., but &quot;there should be no people on Monday.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Li Zhicheng received the news, he cooperated with the police and obtained the surveillance video of the incident on the entire second floor. At that time, the police also wanted to use his camera to confirm whether anyone was trapped. Surveillance video showed that around 19:20, the entire roof suddenly collapsed. He originally added a plaster wall on the second floor. The entire wall was washed down by the huge air wave, and the camera also fell down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhicheng borrowed 200,000 yuan from a friend to open this venue. &quot;Our family is still a poor household in the county. We originally thought that we could make back our money in the first two years, but we failed in the third and fourth years.&quot; I can make a profit, but now I have nothing. Fortunately among misfortunes, my store happened to be doing a general cleaning today. If there were casualties in my store, I would never be able to live with it for the rest of my life. My parents are quite heartwarming anyway, and they are all asking me if I have any problems. It’s okay”. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The incident had just been inspected two months ago&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Information Office of Huanan County Government of Heilongjiang Province issued a notice in the early morning: At 0:35 on November 7, Yuecheng, Huanan County Rescue completed at the scene of a partial collapse of a fitness gym.

Company (hereinafter referred to as Yuecheng Real Estate). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public bidding information shows that the project has two phases. The construction unit that won the bid for the first phase is Heilongjiang Haifeng Weiye Construction and Installation Engineering Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Haifeng Weiye). The construction start date is June 30, 2018, and the completion date is October 1, 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The winning construction unit for the second phase is Heilongjiang Huayou Construction Engineering Co., Ltd.

The construction start date is June 10, 2018, and the completion date is October 1, 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter contacted Yue Chengqi, the legal representative of Haifeng Weiye. The other party said that he was aware of the stadium collapse incident, but was not sure whether it was a project built by him and &quot;needs to go back and check the information.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tendering information shows that Haifeng Weiye is a major tenderer of the Huanan County Government and participates in a wide variety of projects. In terms of municipal projects, we have undertaken the construction of public parking lots, roads, high-speed rail parking lots, etc., and medical projects include the county CDC, the infectious disease area of ​​the county hospital, and the 120 emergency center, as well as the construction of beautiful rural infrastructure in Huanan County and the county power supply bureau. The material reserve warehouse and the black soil transfer earthwork in the pig slaughtering plant area of ​​Huanan Economic Development Zone. In addition, we also won the bid for the county&#39;s affordable housing project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mou Yandong, the shareholder of Huayou Construction, the winning bidder for the second phase of Yuecheng Phase II, is the second shareholder of Yuecheng Real Estate. Similar to Haifeng Weiye, Huayou Construction is also a major tenderer for government projects. In addition to Yuecheng Plaza, it has received at least three government projects, namely the Jiamusi Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital’s medical housing renovation project, the Huachuan County Culture, Radio, Television, Press and Publication Bureau’s cultural facilities construction project, and the Huannan County village and town construction project. Management center’s dilapidated house renovation project in Hunan County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A company was also registered at the address of the collapsed stadium, called Heilongjiang Yuecheng Sports Culture Development Co., Ltd.

Supervisor of City Real Estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is quite strange is that Yuecheng Real Estate and Yuecheng Sports have been canceled in 2021 and 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuecheng Real Estate was once a local star company. According to local media reports in Huanan, “After vigorous investment promotion by the county housing and construction department, Beijing Deyiyintong Technology Co., Ltd. invested 380 million yuan in the former Olin in the county.

In 2017, our company plans to invest 170 million yuan, and all is now in place. All preparatory work for the construction is Arrangements are in place, and the commercial and residential area is now in the interior and exterior decoration stage, and is expected to be completed and put into use in August.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that the Yuecheng Plaza complex project ranks as a provincial key project in Heilongjiang and appeared in the Huanan County Government Work Report in 2017. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, the official website of Huanan County Government still retains reports of the grand event that year. On January 22, 2018, Huanan County Yuecheng Plaza opened. The deputy magistrate of the county government delivered an opening speech and announced the opening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuecheng Plaza is introduced as “an urban comprehensive commercial complex integrating leisure, entertainment, shopping, experience and other functions.

It will surely become a well-known urban complex project in the county, improve the taste of the city, and contribute to the comprehensive construction of vitality, civilization, ecology, integrity, wisdom, The harmonious and happy beautiful Huanan adds luster.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many surrounding neighbors confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that the Yuecheng Stadium where the incident occurred has been sealed off, but the KTV located in the Yuecheng Plaza shopping mall was still open for business that night. On Dianping, a netizen commented that Yuecheng Plaza is the best place to have fun in this county. “I’ve been to this small county a few times, but I can’t remember other places.

Currently, three people are trapped. The local government and fire department are doing their best to rescue them in the snow. Prior to this, this news had quickly become a hot topic across the Internet and attracted great public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many people were in the library at that time, how many students were among them, and what the casualties were are what the public is eager to know. According to the latest disclosure from the local government information office: at 0:35 on the 7th, the rescue at the accident site has been completed; when the accident occurred, there were 7 people on site, 3 of whom escaped on their own, 1 was slightly injured, and 3 were killed; the venue where the accident occurred It belongs to the New Sunshine Fitness Club in Huanan County, and the club leader has been controlled by the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what caused the stadium to collapse? According to CCTV reports, the gymnasium is a two-story frame structure with a construction area of ​​about 2,000 square meters. The collapsed location was the basketball area on the second floor on the west side, with the collapsed area of ​​about 500 square meters. Video posted online showed that the roof of a building collapsed. The four walls were intact. The building was about two stories high. The scene was covered with snow and wall fragments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The collapse of the gymnasium roof reminds people of the roof collapse of the No. 34 Middle School gymnasium in Qiqihar City in July this year. The accident killed 11 teachers and students of the school&#39;s women&#39;s volleyball team who were training in the gym. The cause of the collapse was that the construction unit illegally stacked perlite on the roof of the gymnasium. The perlite absorbed rainwater and gained weight, causing the roof load to increase and cause the collapse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The collapse of the Huanan County Gymnasium this time was also a roof collapse, which is similar to the collapse of the Qiqihar Gymnasium. Therefore, there are also voices pointing to the heavy snow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the blizzard red warning signal issued by the Jiamusi Meteorological Observatory at 17:30 on November 6, the cumulative snowfall in the city in 6 hours has reached 15 mm. The snowfall is expected to continue until the morning of the 7th, with accumulated snowfall in the process. The amount can reach 25-35 mm. The Huanan County Meteorological Observatory issued a red snow warning signal at 16:47 earlier: The snowfall in our county has reached more than 15 mm within 6 hours and the snowfall is still continuing. Please pay attention to precautions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The collapse of the No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium in Qiqihar City was related to rainfall. It rained frequently in the area for a period of time before the incident. Perlite can gain three times its weight after absorbing water, and the water is not easy to dissipate. After repeated rains, the weight of perlite will increase a lot. Moreover, these perlite building materials are not laid flat on the roof, but gathered in one place, which increases the pressure on part of the roof structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The roof of the collapsed gymnasium in Huanan County was covered with snow. Judging from the video posted online, the snow on the ground is not too deep. Winter has just begun in the Northeast at this time, and there should be no snow before. The snow on the roof is mainly caused by this snowfall. Unlike rain, snow does not accumulate in one place, and the pressure is basically evenly distributed to the entire roof. Is 15 millimeters of snow enough to collapse the roof of a stadium? Converted into pressure, it is only 15 kilograms per square meter, or 147N/square meters. The standard live load value for roofs that are not accessible to people is 0.5kN/square meter (50 kilograms of force per square meter). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium in Qiqihar City, which is an old building with a history of more than 30 years, according to media reports citing eyewitness reports, the collapsed gymnasium in Huanan County was a newly built urban complex in recent years. If the entire roof cannot withstand a pressure of 15 kgf/m², does its construction quality pass the standard? How did it pass the inspection in the first place? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that after the collapse of the No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium in Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province held an emergency video conference on production safety throughout the province that night and requested that the buildings of various schools and public welfare sports venues be quickly organized and inspected. Safety.根据桦南县政府网站消息，2023年7月24日下午，也就是齐齐哈尔市三十四中体育馆屋顶坍塌第二天，桦南县县长曾专门到悦城广场全民健身体育馆察看安全工作落实情况。仅仅过了3个多月，这座体育馆就发生了极其类似的屋顶坍塌事故，说明桦南县当时恐怕只是走个形式，并没有认真进行安全排查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在齐齐哈尔市三十四中体育馆坍塌事故发生四个月前，齐齐哈尔市教育局也曾经开展过校舍安全检查。这次安全检查，同样没有发现体育馆屋顶上堆放大量珍珠岩这一严重的安全隐患，最终导致悲剧发生。事故发生原因虽有降雨因素，但更是人祸。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次桦南县体育馆屋顶坍塌，真正的原因尚待查明。但无论如何，屋顶坍塌说明3个月前的建筑安全检查肯定是不到位的。这些走马观花、应付公事、形式主义的检查，还有多少？还要付出多少生命的代价，才能换回对安全的真正重视？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这座体育馆在3个月前的安全检查中轻松过关，如何解释？更重要的是，这一体育馆是当地2018年建成的招商引资项目悦城广场城市综合商业体的一部分。这一综合体总建筑面积11万多平方米，包括商业、住宅和配套公建等等。体育馆建筑质量如此不堪的话，整个综合体的其他部分，有没有质量问题和安全隐患？这可是比体育馆质量安全严重得多的大问题。建筑施工单位、监理单位、开发商与当地监管部门分别应该承担什么责任，应该搞清楚；俱乐部负责人在这个施工过程中有没有责任，也应该搞清楚，不能让运营方成为整个事件的背锅侠。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公众期待这些问题能尽快得到答案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[史国威：打破摄影与绘画的边界]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259929]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/xg0hnrzo0ZCiBuLzrU0BwZisyNWVwdgt8GSxiT6p.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;室内空间越来越小，史国威在一楼画画的时候，他的猫们便待在loft的二楼；有时即使下楼跳上工作台，也懂得始终和正在作画的区域保持一米距离。看着这群年事已高的宠物，如同目睹一个过度清晰的结局。此前接连送走几只，他再也不敢养新的猫，想到一次次站在火葬场炉子前面的场景，就不禁流露出痛苦的神色，“心脏实在受不了了”。眼下的几只他也只能随遇而安，“不敢带它们去做体检，都这么老了，查出问题肯定要治，精力、时间，还有费用上都承受不了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早知道要反复面对这种煎熬，刚开始他兴许就选择绕过这一遭。那会儿是2006年，他刚从德国多特蒙德高等专业学院学完摄影回来，和当时很多兴奋潦倒、试图成为艺术家的年轻人一样，在黑桥弄了间阔大的工作室，棚内摆拍完成后，将人物照与户外实景和带有中国元素的物品循着西方名画拼贴合成，洗成近两米宽的巨幅黑白照，最终手工上色成彩色绘画作品。做盆景生意的父亲有时来看史国威，从北京曾经最大的莱太花卉市场揣来一窝出生不久的流浪猫，他不忍放逐，只好收下这堆花色迥异的兄弟姐妹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;心肠软的单身汉，带着近十只幼猫（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;生完两窝后母猫消失，他这才得以罢手&lt;/span>;），开始了彼时尚而一片模糊的艺术生涯。他雇了一位中间人，专门替他搜罗素人模特，不要凹凸有致、美丽动人的，反而以丑陋、冲突为核心追求。维纳斯不再是平和柔美的象征，肥肉横飞的裸女闭着眼睛，酣睡正甜，身旁放了许多诡异的塑胶娃娃，背景中的圆明园着了火。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/f9uPJOCXa1XpSg5L8Ld0W0Sh05Qv0tIp47Rq4sKA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;692&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/f9uPJOCXa1XpSg5L8Ld0W0Sh05Qv0tIp47Rq4sKA.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;到2010年左右，这位经验丰富的锅炉工（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;工作室暖气微弱，为熬过漫长冬季，黑桥的艺术家们身披黑大衣，不断铲煤防止熄灭，每天脸上、手上都是黑的，煤掂在手里就知道多少钱一吨&lt;/span>;）创作了近二十张视觉冲击力强的裸体作品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;给照片手工上色需要大量时间，这一方式最先运用在他的硕士毕业作品上。为了能在德国顺利毕业，从一圈动不动就去瑞士或印度、埃及拍大片的富裕同学中脱颖而出，只有条件在学校免费提供的影棚里捣鼓的史国威思索良久，想到应该弥补自己在拍摄硬件、技术方面的短处，同时突出美术方面的长处。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大学时他就读于清华美院平面视觉艺术交流系摄影专业，但前三年的课程跟摄影毫无直接关联，每天都在训练素描、色彩、雕塑等技能，光是素描基础课就上了两年，练就了和美术生无异的绘画功底。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确定了摄影加绘画的创作方式，内容构思上他依然围绕后面几年忙活的东西方文化对比，请外国模特穿上花木兰戏服，再请中国模特穿侠盗罗宾汉的服装，或是打扮成教皇模样，脸上却画着京剧脸谱。“这个比较好操作，还能够用大座机，起码材料上就比大家牛逼。黑白照冲印好后我再用手工上色的办法把它给画成彩色，这样的话马上就凸显出来，你跟所有学生都不一样。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;策展人及评论家凯伦·史密斯曾总结过，“他观察并记录景象，创作出传统摄影风格的黑白照片，随后对其进行长时间的手工上色。这一过程不仅要求相机镜头背后的眼手协调，亦需精准把控笔刷的涂抹方式；自德国多特蒙德高等摄影学院学成归国后，史国威逐渐形成了自己持恒不变、令人叹服的视觉表达方式，在摄影和绘画间寻得细腻精巧的融合。而其中诸多材料与手法的结合，也使其作品承载的内涵远超&#39;手工上色照片&#39;这一标签的字面意义。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回国初期，对于作品中充斥的大量血腥暴力色情，他回想道，许是来自“在社会中多年的压抑，德国读书时期大部分时间都在打工谋生，迫不得已去餐厅洗盘子，去工厂上夜班扛包，做着最底层的活。艺术什么的对我来讲没什么关系，当时首先是要吃饱饭活下来，第二个目标是尽快毕业，才能对家里有个交代。有了这个文凭才能谋生，才能干我要干的事情”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那几年的作品出现在大大小小的一些展览中，但收获的认可很少。“当时就想做跟西方有关系的事情，以为大家都能看懂，但其实通过几次展览，发现大家不知道我要干嘛呀，不知道来源。现在看起来那时就像是在那儿使劲大声地喊，特别强烈地吆喝，但也没有什么效果，还不如安静一点。如果说以前打的是浮于表面的花架子，现在打的都是内伤，就是不动声色，但其实气功已经穿透你的身体了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Hxm6eYLC2cSPba4i9gtCjIUwz3t9kP9wVFjNhQ6A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;795&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Hxm6eYLC2cSPba4i9gtCjIUwz3t9kP9wVFjNhQ6A.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;大概从10年前开始，他的创作内容发生了极大变化。“慢慢转变是因为开始到山里走，拍一些跟自然有关的照片，感受更多，就想更回归到自己。之前的那些作品都是跟社会、跟别人有关，输出我对外界的一些认知，跟我自己没有太多关系。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刚开始转向自然时史国威追求的仍是形的相似与否，一丝不苟画得非常精细、非常隐晦，草本身是绿的，画出来还是绿的，只不过绿的程度可能跟彩色照片相比有微妙变化，那时他希望听见的，是观众猛一看，“哎，这不是彩色照片吗”的观感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近几年，他越来越向内，去一趟灵山，可能只拍一两张有感触的。2023年9月魔金石画廊的个展中，一些画作来自他在新疆、大兴安岭等地旅途中的拍摄，挑选时他越发严苛，“你会想这个场景是不是和我有关，它究竟值不值得。”覆盖的痕迹也越来越重，让人几乎难以看出原貌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;岩石在他笔下被画成生肉一般的质感，再壮美的风景，透过他的双目，往往都转化为残酷的产物。宠物的死和亲人的过世萦绕在他心头，看到堆得像巨大蒙古包似的、等待羊毛贩子过来收购的羊毛，深棕、浅棕、黄色交缠在风中，牧民习以为常，他只觉得残忍；眼见鄂温克族猎手特别顺手地用20分钟解决一头鹿，他又想起十几岁时跟随父亲打猎后独自处理野兔（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;勾上门框、提刀、剥皮&lt;/span>;）的一幕幕，“当时看得既熟悉又难受，所以为什么我的画里一直有肉？有血？这种气息是贯穿始终的，只不过现在用得更稳定，不像十多年前那么大面积的血腥。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在同样做着艺术工作的妻子看来，这种染色之后的图像不是还原，而是比现实更主观，是对现实图景的怀疑和不满足。着色在现实上的虚构景观，意味着抛开过往摄影课上还原色卡、极致精准的训练，在“视而不见”中完成否认与逆反。他曾说，“这些年我一直不懈地尝试，试图打破摄影与绘画的边界，就像打破一道腐朽的墙。更确切地说，我正努力使自己游离在边缘线上，活像走钢丝的杂技演员保持着平衡，不倒向任何一边，无论摄影还是绘画。只有这样才能使我更加清醒和冷静地面对周遭的事物，使自己不迷失。就像河流的边缘总是长着比别处肥美的野草，那里的养分才最丰富。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;听了孩子的话，我给他细细算了一笔经济账：倘若他每天浪费9元钱，每周就浪费63元钱，每月浪费252元钱，那么每年则浪费三千多元，这笔钱可以购买一只不错的手机、一款品牌洗衣机，也可以支付一个农村贫困人口一年的生活花销。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一席话令孩子感到极为震撼，他连连感叹，“妈妈，你给我算这笔账前我真没想到，每天浪费一点点，积少成多居然会损失这么多啊，以后我就要求你少买点，你也记住咯！”看他满脸诚恳，我不由地感慨，现代孩子的节约意识真得从小培养！&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诚然，当今优渥的物质生活条件容易让孩子缺乏金钱观念。从小饭来张口、衣来伸手，想要什么张张口，家长就会毫无保留地满足，有些家长甚至觉得自己小时候受了太多苦，童年有很多乐趣都没有享受体验过，就认为不能亏欠孩子。久而久之，心智不全的孩子就不知道金钱从哪来，更无法理解赚钱的不易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，家长错误的引导，也是导致孩子没有金钱观念的主要原因。随着现代科技的发展，人们往往采用移动支付而较少使用现金支付，每到“6·18”“双11”等电商节时，很多家长也是不管有用没用“买买买”。方便快捷的支付背后，让孩子感受不到金钱到底是什么，也不会过问“我家里到底有多少钱”“爸妈一天能挣多少钱”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，学校教育手段的局限性，同样也是导致孩子缺乏金钱观念和节约意识的重要原因。相信所有的学校都会告诫孩子从小养成节约的习惯，但耳提面命式的规劝和督促，显然很难发挥其应有的功效，当然也较难引起孩子的共情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们都知道，孩子正处于三观形成的关键时期，家长和学校的适当引导，对于他们塑成正确的价值观念来说，显得尤为重要。正因如此，作为家长，我们首先要引导孩子树立正确的金钱观念。用浅显易懂的语言，给孩子好好算笔账，让他们具象化地了解金钱的概念，真切地感受到金钱来之不易。不妨给孩子准备一个存钱罐，让他们自己攒钱、自己使用，告诫他们不乱买乱花。带着孩子参加一些社会劳动，让孩子切身体会赚钱的艰辛和乐趣，让他们在劳动中体会赚钱不易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;苦口婆心不如言传身教，父母是孩子效仿的榜样，好的榜样催人奋进，坏的榜样则祸害无穷。身为父母，我们自身要养成节约的好习惯，在生活点滴中教会孩子为什么要节约，怎样养成节约的好习惯，告诉他们钱要花在刀刃上，进而营造当花则花、勤俭节约的家庭氛围。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毋庸置疑，学校教育和社会引导对于孩子塑成节约习惯，也是极为重要的。在学校教育中，开展“100元度过一月”等主题研学活动，组织孩子们深入乡村贫困地区体验生活、感受贫困，让他们真真切切体会到赚钱不易、生活艰辛，鼓励他们养成节约美德。与此同时，广播、电视等社会大众媒体，也要多多宣传“餐桌上的节约新风尚”等，倡导大家弘扬传统美德。还可以鼓励东部发达地区孩子与中西部贫困地区孩子结对子、互帮助，让生活在蜜罐里的“小公主”“小王子”们用自身行动，帮助贫困地区孩子实现“上学梦”“求知梦”，促进共同成长，让“小公主”“小王子”们切实体悟到节约的大作用。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;文章称，2022年，她被苏州一家互联网公司辞退，喝了散伙酒后第二天发生脑梗中风，后续至少需要养护一年，除了不能喝酒、不能吃高油高盐食物之外，还要定期去医院开药，需要一笔医药费。父母在她8岁时离婚，各自组建了新家庭，她在奶奶与姑姑照顾下长大，故而向最亲近的姑姑开口，但姑姑称“不方便承担”；又向父亲求助，希望每个月借自己两三千块钱，父亲表示只能为她缴纳住院期间的费用；向母亲求助，母亲没有任何反应。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;媒体上这样的报道不少，比如还有一篇关于断亲的报道，描述了37岁的叶文，小时候他是留守儿童，父母都在东莞打工，他没考上大学，做摄影学徒、开摄影工作室、喜欢文学、创作工人诗歌，“不被家族乃至父母理解”。他认为，他和父亲的关系断在一个钱字上，2019年，他想开一个摄影工作室，向父亲借一万块钱，父亲不说话，用他的话来说是“装死”。他继续追问：“你借还是不借，说句话。”父亲回了句：“你的事我管不起。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以上两个断亲的案例，都挺极端的。断亲，有两种定义或类型：一种是（主动）与父母、家人及亲戚断绝联系，这个界定很明确；另一种是所谓“懒于、疏于与亲戚来往”，这个界定又很模糊，后面会进一步讨论。一个常见的误区是以前者的极端案例来涵盖后者，以夸大年轻人断亲的广度与严重性。其实两种情形有差异，当分开讨论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先讨论上述两个案例及第一种断亲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年32岁的女性小怪与37岁的叶文，童年都有缺失：一个是父母离婚各自组成了新家庭，没有将她养在身边；一个小时候是留守儿童，父母忙于打工挣钱不能相伴，令人同情。不过，这两人早已成年，作为成年人，如何看待与处理同父母、家人及亲戚的关系，也应该以成年人的方式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成年人的方式也无非两种：一种是现代方式，一个独立、有个人权利与尊严、能自负其责的自己Vs其他同样独立、有边界的个体；一种是传统方式，大家同属于一个大家庭或家族，讲血浓于水、讲亲情，大家庭或家族是自然血缘共同体，有互助的金融、保险功能。你只能选择一种，每一种方式都是对等的，你付出什么，就会得到什么，谁也不能予取予求、一味索取。不能说两种方式的好处我全要、坏处我全推，那是极端精致利己主义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，小怪已经31岁。奶奶与姑姑在她父母离婚后照顾、养大了她，这不是姑姑的本分，而是情分，这是讲传统、是来自大家庭的帮助。而在她成年之后，姑姑也有自己的小家庭，“不方便承担”她的养护、医药费用，也没有什么不合理的，为何对姑姑产生这么高的心理预期？未达预期后又产生这么大的怨恨，与姑姑断绝关系？她工作也应该有一些年份了，对姑姑早年的养育之恩有报答过吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个成年人，如果奉行现代方式，不预期从父母或大家庭那里得到任何帮助，平时也不维护同父母、家人及亲戚的关系，那就应该自负其责，例如工作挣钱后要存钱，以备不时之需；选择健康的生活方式，照顾好自己的身心健康，因为已经打定主意只靠自己了。不能在自己活蹦乱跳时讲个人自由独立，遇到麻烦了又想起父母与大家庭了。事实上，在她向父亲开口后，父亲愿意给成年的她缴纳住院费用，讲情分，只是没有满足她“每个月借自己两三千块钱”的要求而已，为何要与父亲绝断关系？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样，2019年，叶文33岁，向父亲借一万元钱开摄影工作室，父亲不借，就与父亲断了关系，这也是对父亲产生了很高的心理预期，达不到预期后又产生了很大的怨恨。讲现代方式，父亲借是情分，不借是本分。在这个意义上，父亲与任何其他人是一样的，你向任何一个朋友借钱，朋友借是情分，不借是本分，你难道会因为朋友不借而翻脸吗？如此岂不是坐实了朋友不借的正确性吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，对于第二种断亲，一些人认为原因在于：一些年轻人不再重视“血缘关系”，也厌恶父权社会里以男性长辈为核心的家族聚会；进步意义很大，“亲戚是没得选的，朋友是可以选的”，反映了“熟人社会”向“陌生人社会”的变迁。这些论述都是值得商榷的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如前文所说，大家庭或家族是自然血缘共同体，这本身意味着你出生就有（Birthright）的社会资本，为何弃之如敝履？在某种程度上，基于血缘与亲情的信任是无可替代的，且亲情维护成本很低，你在本地，定期去拜访一下；在外地，逢年过节打个电话、发个短信，显示自己的心意。在和平与繁荣的时代且你春风得意的时候，这些关系可能用不上；但在面临困难与挑战的时候，家人抱团取暖抵御风险才是最可靠的，原子化个体抗风险能力是很差的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“懒于、疏于与亲戚来往”有两种可能。一种是你实质上断亲了。问题是：奇葩或人品差的亲戚，你不和其来往就行了，不至于要与所有的亲戚实质上断绝联系。儒家说“修身齐家”，与所有亲戚都搞不好关系的人，恐怕自己也有问题。如果你在高速上开车，发现所有的车都在逆行，那真相只有一个：不是别人在逆行，而是你在逆行。另一种只是你内心这么想，又长期在外地，你的父母仍替你出面维持着亲戚人情关系，这是假断亲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;朋友确实可以选择，但至交、生死之交是难得的，需要精神与价值观的高度契合+长期共同生活与交往建立的深度信任。人一辈子能有几个至交、生死之交？更何况，维护亲戚关系与交朋友没有替代关系，可以并行不悖。而且，那些断绝血缘与亲情的人，恐怕也很难与连血缘关系都没有的人建立深度联系与信任，而在旁人眼里，也很难成为可信任的朋友。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，所谓“陌生人社会”，并不是说要消灭“熟人社会”，而是“熟人社会”内嵌于“陌生人社会”，你所面临的世界仍是一个有差等的同心圆，圆心是你自己，小家庭与大家庭依次将你包裹住。至于“父权社会”的说法，是对父亲、婚姻与家庭（文明基石之一）的一种解构，文明驯化了男性、令其承担家庭责任、提供资源与保护，提升了子代的生存能力。 &lt;/p>;
