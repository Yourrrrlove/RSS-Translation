A large &quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; roll-up banner divided the space into two, and a media conducted an interview, asking Lin Jiadong about the cooperation between &quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; and the director and starring actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because the appointment took the longest, my interview was scheduled as the last one of the day. I&#39;m worried that he will be tired after the intensive announcements during the promotion period, or his desire to express will weaken (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is very normal&lt;/span>;). but no. When the staff and I walked around the roll-up banners, Lin Jiadong turned to look out the floor-to-ceiling window, looking very interested. Outside is the night view of Beijing&#39;s Third Ring Road. There are office buildings with lights on in the darkness, which may be very similar to Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He likes to observe other people&#39;s lives. He said that he likes to sit in a tea restaurant and listen to people gossiping - he imitates how guests and waiters shout in a tea restaurant where people are crowded around tables. He said that if others looked at him, he would look back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lin Jiadong, I saw what a good actor looks like. He is not particularly handsome, but the environment in which he lives allows for diverse creations. There is no need to have the appearance of an idol, and there is no need to expose a lot of private life. As a profession, the life of an actor can really be very long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that there is no age anxiety in him. When he played a supporting role in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; 21 years ago, he was already in his thirties (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;he was born in 1967&lt;/span>;), Abandoned the stable path of starring in TVB. Later, he said that it was unbearable to film so many TV series in a year. He has played golden supporting roles in many movies, such as two &quot;Underworld&quot; and &quot;Exile&quot;, &quot;Ip Man&quot;, and &quot;Chill&quot;. He has built a solid foundation step by step. In past interviews, he has always said that he is a boring and boring person. Apart from acting, he rarely talks about his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It would be better to end this article with a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the appointed time, the interview was coming to an end. After asking the last question, I couldn’t help but ask how they rehearsed the positioning of the long shot in &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a work in which Jack Lam starred for free and supported new Hong Kong directors. He plays Guan Chao, a former Chinese-American British soldier who is completely unsuitable for the new era. There is a nearly 10-minute long shot at the end of &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot;, which is extremely exciting. The camera looks far away on the rooftop. The gangster Guan Chao worked for before discovered that his betrayal was not just about money, but also hiding the person who stole the gangster&#39;s goods worth tens of millions. Extreme violence occurs in this long shot, where Guan Chao is beaten by a group of thugs. Everyone&#39;s fight was not good-looking, using brute force and deadly strikes. Guan Chao got into a scuffle with someone and was beaten badly. He stumbled from one room to another and was beaten violently by two people from the other party he had offended. He was already dying (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The camera recorded Guan Chao&#39;s death in real time&lt;/span>;), Guan Chao used his last bit of strength to rush to the camera , and immersed the person who was lying on top of him to restrain him into the water tank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our action director arranged it first. His martial arts actor did it once. He filmed it and cut it out for me to see. He said, can you do it like this? I remember at that time I said, Director , I’m not young anymore.” Lin Jiadong smiled and repeated, and the director said, “You can do it, Jiadong!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Okay. Lin Jiadong watched the long shot twice, and everyone rehearsed it twice more. The shooting started. When he shot the first shot, his eye was injured. He went to the hospital and came back to continue filming. He happily recalled the scene at the end of the long scene where Guan Chao dragged the person to the water tank and submerged him. It was very enjoyable. &quot;For this character, he only has these 10 seconds in his life (to fight back like this). That should be his response to life.&quot; Roaring.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我放弃改造“扫兴”父母：“人教人很难，事教人一次就会”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257398]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;When we were young, our parents took us to know the world; when we grow up, we also hope to take our parents to see the world. But our parents’ response often disappoints us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I take them on a trip, they mumble along the way, saying, &quot;You spend money to find trouble.&quot; When you take them to enjoy delicious food, they say, &quot;It&#39;s not as good as the food at home.&quot; You buy them down jackets and furs. A coat, they say, is &quot;not as light and warm as a cotton-padded jacket&quot;... Every time I happily do this or that for my parents, I always get thrown cold water on it, which makes me feel annoyed. Sometimes I will show it out and quarrel with my parents, saying, &quot;The dog bites me.&quot; Lu Dongbin——I don’t know the good heart.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the discussion on the Internet about &quot;parents who are not a spoiler&quot; has attracted a lot of attention. The negative example is my parents. The positive teaching material is to happily accept the kindness of their children, and their children will take them to eat. Enjoy it and say &quot;It&#39;s delicious.&quot; When your children buy clothes for them, they put them on immediately and say &quot;It looks good.&quot; Your children order takeout and happily follow it to taste... There are also people who take their parents to &quot;swear&quot; before taking them shopping: &quot;I am determined not to waste money, I am determined not to spend money to find trouble, and I am determined not to eat junk food again...&quot; I feel very sad! So I forwarded these short videos to my mother to see, hoping that she would change. She immediately said, &quot;You have to pretend to like it even if you don&#39;t like it?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I really had nothing to say. I have to admit that she is right. Rational analysis shows that these short videos, on the one hand, capture the emotions of adult children who are disappointed by their parents; on the other hand, for the sake of traffic, they create an image of &quot;parents who are not disappointed&quot; and please the adult children who occupy the mainstream of the Internet population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is indeed a generation gap between us and our parents. First of all, we have different growth backgrounds and different views on money. My parents’ generation experienced an era of insufficient material wealth, so they are very frugal. Although many people have pensions that exceed their adult children’s salary and have less expenses, they are still reluctant to spend money. As my mother’s famous saying “Saving money is the key to saving money” My greatest pleasure.&quot; In this way, we can understand why uncles and aunts are willing to line up for two hours to receive 10 eggs, and why old people who live in high-end communities are keen to collect scraps and sell them, not only because they have free time, but also because they are used to being frugal. What&#39;s more, the characteristics of their generation have been accurately grasped by scammers, and they often succeed under the guise of &quot;free&quot;. I once advised my mother not to fill in personal information in order to receive the free small fans, small mirrors, and low-quality tissues, so as not to receive countless phone calls or even encounter telecom fraud. But she firmly believed: &quot;It&#39;s free, don&#39;t give it up!&quot; &quot;I just Without spending money, what can he deceive me about?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the behavior of our parents to discourage us is due to our different views on money. Our generation has become accustomed to loans to buy houses, credit card purchases, and &quot;spending money.&quot; &quot;Baitiao&quot;, look for housekeeping and cleaning, and be more frugal, earn ten yuan and spend five yuan... As long as you are comfortable and happy, you should spend money. But they would rather walk five streets under the scorching sun than spend two yuan to take a bus. They can spend two hours taking a bus and wander slowly, so they won&#39;t spend 10 minutes taking a taxi to get there. Therefore, the essence of their disincentive to us is that they are afraid that we will spend money, because we are one family with them. They have experienced a period of material scarcity, have richer life experiences, and understand the ups and downs of life better. They often say that &quot;a penny can stump a hero&quot;, &quot;a long stream of water will keep you from worrying when encountering disasters&quot;, &quot;thinking ahead and looking ahead, you will always have food and clothing&quot; &quot;If you don&#39;t have enough food, you won&#39;t have enough clothes. If you don&#39;t calculate, you will be poor.&quot; &quot;Three years for the new, three years for the old, and three more years for mending.&quot; They save money not only out of habit, but also to fully support us when needed. , let us borrow less when buying a house, pay less every month, and have more money...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two generations have different views on money, and it is difficult to distinguish the pros and cons. Although my mother is also aware of the benefits brought by another consumption concept, it is still difficult to overcome the hurdle in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about the changes in our generation&#39;s consumption outlook. It has gone through almost twenty years. From college, we started accepting credit cards, mobile payments, and e-commerce. After working, we started to make rapid progress, buying, buying, buying, and now live broadcasting. After grabbing time, we began to reflect again, burst the consumption bubble, and became more rational... Now we force our parents&#39; generation to immediately keep up with our pace and support our consumption concept 100%. It is really unrealistic. The transformation of parents also needs to be done step by step. We have stepped on the consumption &quot;pits&quot; that we have stepped on before, bought a bunch of cheap and unused small items, been deceived several times, returned the goods several times, and been injured several times. Only then can the mind slowly become enlightened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother rented out the house and persuaded her to install new furniture. She was not willing to spend money, so she moved the &quot;old antiques&quot; that were no longer needed at home to the rental house. She was not fashionable at all. As a result, many tenants came and did not It looks like it has never been rented out. So, she asked someone to move the &quot;old antiques&quot; and install new furniture. Moving around, owing favors, and delaying renting, I indirectly lost a lot of money, which was far more than the money for new furniture. &quot;It&#39;s hard to teach others, but you can teach them everything once.&quot; She was convinced after he calculated the economic accounts for her through his words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days ago, I saw in my circle of friends that they were going on a &quot;travel&quot;. The so-called &quot;travel&quot; meant visiting various towns and villages under the jurisdiction of our county. They happily told me that due to preferential policies, local residents over sixty years old can ride the bus for free. If they bring a bottle of boiled water and two boiled eggs, they can go out for a day without spending a penny. I suddenly realized that for us, Lijiang, Xinjiang, Tibet, Maldives, and Iceland are poetry and distance, but for them, the surrounding towns and villages are their poetry and distance, and this is a travel experience that is more suitable for their &quot;physical constitution.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our parents grew up with us and took the trouble to teach us to understand and experience small things one by one. As we grow older with our parents, we must also change our mentality, stop being harsh, and patiently accompany our parents to &quot;grow&quot; together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then on, I gave up trying to reform my &quot;disappointing&quot; parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a middle school teacher in Tianjin)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Heavy rains of 150 to 240 millimeters caused severe flooding in many cities. The port city of Derna was particularly severely affected. The wind waves in the city center were as high as 20 feet. Two old dams on the Wadi Derna river in the upper reaches collapsed. After the floods raged, almost no intact building could be found in the entire city, and some residents were swept into the Mediterranean Sea with their houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United Nations stated on September 16 that the local death toll has exceeded 11,300, and another 10,100 people are still alive and dead. 40,000 people are homeless. There are still dead bodies soaked in the sea and no one has salvaged them. The number is bound to rise again. Libyan state-run media stated on the 17th that it is currently known that 891 buildings in Derna were completely destroyed, 211 buildings were partially destroyed, and 398 houses were soaked in mud after being flooded. The mayor&#39;s office speculated that the death toll could eventually reach 20,000 - equivalent to a fifth of the city&#39;s population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 17th, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs cited data from the World Health Organization and published a report, revising the death toll caused by the Libyan floods to 3,958, with more than 9,000 people missing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Derna is a city with a long history. &lt;/span>;) already exists. Amid the 2011 anti-government demonstrations in Libya, the city broke away from the control of Gaddafi&#39;s government on February 18. In 2014, the city was occupied by Islamic State militants, during which it was subjected to multiple air strikes by the Egyptian military. In 2015, the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council, a militia considered close to Al Qaeda, defeated the Islamic State and regained control of the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, General Khalifa Haftar, regarded as the main authority in eastern Libya, has led the siege of Derna, the last territory in eastern Libya that has resisted his rule, with intensive bombing and brutal The ground fighting inflicted heavy losses on the city. In 2018, Haftar finally captured Derna. Haftar did not order a large-scale reconstruction of Derna out of distrust of its residents. It was not until 2022 that the eastern Libyan government formulated a reconstruction plan for Derna. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to years of war, Derna City does not have unified central government management, its infrastructure is old, and its ability to prevent and control floods is very weak. In recent years, global warming has caused the waters of the Mediterranean to expand, and rising sea levels have eroded coastlines and caused flooding, especially in low-lying coastal areas like Derna. On September 10, 2023, Hurricane Daniel made landfall on the Mediterranean coast of eastern Libya. The hurricane had already caused serious damage in Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria along the Mediterranean coast, resulting in more than a dozen deaths. However, the Libyan authorities did not seriously formulate a monitoring plan. There was no plan to warn or evacuate residents of the dam situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Libyan National Meteorological Center said it had issued warnings through emails and media 72 hours before &quot;Daniel&quot; made landfall, urging local governments to take preventive measures. However, the National Meteorological Center of Libya is affiliated to the Government of National Accord in the west, and Derna is an area controlled by the eastern government. Local residents said that they did not receive warning before the flood hit, and the authorities did not have any evacuation plan. They only heard the loud noise of the dam breaking. Only then did everyone realize that the flood was coming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The World Meteorological Organization pointed out on September 14 that if the Libyan authorities had an early warning system for storms and floods, the vast majority of the victims could have been prevented from dying. In other words, this disaster appears to be a natural disaster, but is actually a man-made disaster. In the future, after floods wash away, landmines and unexploded bombs left over from years of war may surface, and secondary disasters may occur where people accidentally touch landmines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the more than ten years since the fall of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has experienced one war after another and political crisis after another. To this day, it is still in a situation of confrontation between the eastern and western governments. . Many people have long forgotten this long dispute, but the floods that occurred in Derna, causing tens of thousands of deaths and missing people, once again drew people&#39;s attention back to this ill-fated place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pviUluMz4LwOxQ6Ahu3w4waO28itNzjeEPzguqay.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pviUluMz4LwOxQ6Ahu3w4waO28itNzjeEPzguqay.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251350&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 25, 2007, Tripoli, Libya, Libyan supreme leader Muammar Gaddafi (right) welcomed visiting French President Sarkozy&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A divided country&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Libya has an area of ​​1.76 million square kilometers and a population of 6.7 million. It is located in northern Africa and the southern coast of the Mediterranean. To the east is Cyrenaica, to the west is Tripolitania, and to the southwest is Fezzan. There is a desert barrier between the three, making communication inconvenient. They have been separated for a long time in history. Due to the separation of the natural geographical environment, the eastern and western regions of Libya are closely connected with the surrounding Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria, but have little contact with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Libya historically belonged to the Roman Empire, the Arab Empire and the Ottoman Turkish Empire, but these rulers regarded the above three regions as independent plates, so Libya has never been integrated into a unified entity in history. political community. Therefore, like most countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Libya is also a typical tribal country, and people identify with the tribe more than the country. During the period when it was ruled by the Arab Empire, it experienced the process of Islamization. Today, most people in Libya are Sunni believers in Islam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the 20th century, the unified Italy also joined the ranks of colonial expansion and began to look for its own territory in Africa. It took a fancy to Libya under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, so it brazenly launched a war of aggression. In 1912, Italy defeated the Ottoman Empire in the Italian-Turkish War, making Libya an Italian colony. At the same time, the Senussi Order in eastern Cyrenaica launched a large-scale resistance movement in the name of &quot;holy war&quot;. The secular forces in the western region also actively resisted Italian aggression and even established the Republic of Tripoli in 1918. It was later banned and disbanded by Mussolini. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the end of World War II, in July 1949, the leader of the Senussi Order, Idris, declared the independence of Cyrenaica and served as the emir. In December 1951, Idris won the support of nationalist forces and tribes in three regions and finally established the United Kingdom of Libya. The three regions of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan were each a state with autonomy. right. The three colors on the current Libyan flag represent these three federal states and are symbols of federalism. In 1963, Libya&#39;s new constitution abolished the federal system and divided the country into 10 provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1969, Gaddafi, the leader of the &quot;Free Officers Organization&quot;, launched a coup, overthrew the Idris dynasty and established the Libyan Arab Republic. Gaddafi, who was born in the Bedouin tribe of the Fezzan region, has ruled Libya for 42 years, relying mainly on strongman politics and centralization, coupled with distribution policies supported by oil revenue, to barely suppress tribalism and localism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Libya first discovered oil in 1958 and officially started production in 1961. Its oil reserves are approximately 47.1 billion barrels, ranking first in Africa and ninth in the world, accounting for 2.9% of the world&#39;s total. Crude oil has good quality and low sulfur content. It is a high-quality oil and is very popular in the international market. After 1973, with the sharp rise in international oil prices, the Gaddafi regime gained a lot of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid a recurrence of the tragedy of the fall of the Idris dynasty, and at the same time gain public support for his radical anti-imperialist stance, Gaddafi significantly increased investment in housing, health care, education and other fields, and increased workers&#39; wages. , and provide free public housing to the poor; the land originally belonging to the Senussi Order and Italian farmers will also be distributed to farmers, and farm tools and livestock will be provided at extremely low prices; new housing in rural areas can also be financed by government-controlled banks subsidy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But starting in the 1980s, due to the decline in international oil prices, Libyan oil revenue dropped sharply from US$21 billion in 1981 to US$5.4 billion in 1986. After the Lockerbie air crash in 1988, Libya was identified as the mastermind behind the crash and was subject to sanctions and embargoes by Western countries. In addition, oil field facilities are aging and oil production is ups and downs. There is no excess oil revenue to exchange for public support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, 95% of Libya’s export revenue, 75% of government revenue, and 25% of GDP came from oil. At the same time, Libya’s domestic unemployment rate was as high as 30%, and most important infrastructure construction projects and crude oil extraction Projects are completed through international tenders and are completed by foreign companies and technical personnel, while a large number of Libya&#39;s own young labor force is unemployed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2010, the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; broke out in the Middle East, and Libya was also affected. Anti-government demonstrations occurred, and the government responded with force to suppress them. On February 27, 2011, the opposition established the &quot;National Transitional Council&quot; in Benghazi, Libya&#39;s second largest city. On March 19, Britain and France launched air strikes in Libya in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. On September 16, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to replace Libya&#39;s seat in the United Nations by the National Transitional Council. On October 20, Gaddafi was killed on his way to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 11, 2012, in protest against a movie that insulted Islam, the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was attacked by an Islamic armed group. U.S. Ambassador Stevens was killed. The worst damage in years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/mzpx5TBpSLxfSfJJCWEvZMjsOtQwHjc2lgRNNRre.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;628&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/mzpx5TBpSLxfSfJJCWEvZMjsOtQwHjc2lgRNNRre.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251352&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 16, 2023, the disaster-stricken area of ​​Derna, Libya&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Post-Gaddafi era&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Libyan opposition is a group that includes defectors from the original Gaddafi regime, pro-Western liberals, eastern tribal leaders who are dissatisfied with Gaddafi and the dictatorship of western tribes, former Id A hodgepodge of supporters of the Reese royal family, the only thing they have in common is their dissatisfaction with Gaddafi. When the revolution has not yet succeeded, because the common enemy is still there, everyone has to seek common ground while reserving differences and work hard to cooperate. However, when the overall situation is determined, interests emerge, and the struggle for power is inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid infighting and division when sharing the fruits of the revolution, a leader with high moral integrity and the ability to reconcile various factions is necessary. However, during the 42 years of Gaddafi&#39;s rule, Libya had no president, no prime minister, no parliament, no cabinet, only Colonel Gaddafi. The imagination and passion of a generation were limited by the ubiquitous &quot;Green Book&quot;. How could it be possible? Such a politician appeared in a short period of time? In addition, after Gaddafi&#39;s army was disbanded, Libya failed to form a new national army. The existing militia groups strengthened their own forces and expanded their territory, causing the country to fall into a state of disorder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During Gaddafi’s rule, Cyrenaica in the east was suppressed by him for a long time, and the locals were always very dissatisfied. After the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; took place, this was the first place where trouble broke out and started anew. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Libya was divided: the Government of National Accord and its armed forces recognized by the United Nations controlled most of western Libya, while the &quot;National Army&quot; led by Haftar controlled eastern and western Libya. Central Region. The two sides have clashed several times since 2014, and Libya has descended into civil war. The civil war continued until 2020, and the two sides finally reached a ceasefire. However, until now, the general election originally scheduled for 2021 has not been held, and sporadic fighting between the western armed forces and the eastern armed forces continues. Just last month, at least 45 people were killed in fighting between the two sides in Tripoli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An important reason why the situation in Libya cannot be stabilized is the intervention of external forces. The Western Government of National Accord recognized by the United Nations has Turkey, Qatar and Italy as its backers, as well as Egypt, Russia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and France. It supports the Haftar regime that controls the center and east. Italy wants to maintain the &quot;face&quot; of its former colonial master, Turkey wants to restore the glory of the &quot;Ottoman Empire&quot;... Each &quot;player&quot; has different reasons for entering the game. However, they seem to have the same goal behind them, which is the oil and natural gas resources in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the past ten years, a large amount of natural gas and oil have been discovered in this sea area. Libya and even the entire Eastern Mediterranean region have once again become a &quot;powder keg&quot; for various countries to engage in energy competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The consequences of disorder in Libya are not limited to the current out-of-control floods. After the fall of Gaddafi, the rebels looted the weapons arsenal of the government forces, and many weapons were transferred to other surrounding countries, especially extremist organizations. Chadian President Deby believes that the rise of extremist organizations such as the Nigerian terrorist organization &quot;Boko Haram&quot; , has a great relationship with the situation in Libya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[共赴亚运之约！杭州第19届亚洲运动会开幕式]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257509]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 20:09:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[水为串联、潮为意向 亚运会开幕式主题定名《潮起亚细亚》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257473]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 19:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou will open tonight.

At that time, she returned from studying abroad and did not want to live with her parents all the time. , renting an apartment in Beijing, and encountered a second landlord who ran away with money, and her job was not going well, she fell into a low point in life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did she choose to study abroad? Jiu Gu believes that the main reason is that she was isolated in school. From elementary school to high school, Jiu Gu attended one of the top five public schools in Beijing. As grades went up, grades became more and more important. By high school, Jiu Gu felt that everyone cared about grades, and only top academics would be punished. Respect, people like her who like to participate in club activities are &quot;deviants&quot; who are not doing their job properly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The conflict broke out at a chorus festival. Jiu Gu was responsible for organizing rehearsals, but her classmates thought that rehearsals took up study time, and they were against The rejection of the chorus focused on Jiu Gu personally, and the cold violence spread throughout the class like a virus. Jiu Gu felt that she was not wrong. The liberal arts experimental class in the school often had the opportunity to rehearse dramas and participate in cultural and sports activities, while the students in the ordinary class could only As an audience, she just wants to participate once.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu has liked to do activities since she was a child, which is called Zanju in Beijing dialect. For example, she holds a Spring Festival Gala at home and lets her family put on a show. She wants to study abroad. In the early years, many literary and art planners in Beijing had overseas study backgrounds in order to have access to more cultural resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was around 2010. The family was originally planning to use their savings to buy a house. Because of Jiu Gu’s sudden decision, the money was instead used for her study abroad expenses. &quot;At that time, I felt that buying a house was meaningless. Why trap myself in a space? There is a vast world outside, and there is a lot to do.&quot; In her imagination, after returning from studying abroad, she would live a glamorous and dreamy life, save games every day, and attend meetings. Activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu failed to study her favorite musical because her mother thought she would not be able to find a job after graduation, so she chose economics and was admitted to the University of California, Davis. She chose economics because she was interested in marketing. She wanted to know why people decide to buy something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later she discovered that economics was not what she studied, and it was equally difficult to find a job after graduation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on her educational experience, despite having excellent educational resources, Jiu Gu felt that she had made many detours. Some people did not have many resources when they were young, but they knew clearly what they wanted to do and started from scratch. For example, Qiao Xiaodao, &quot;was a welder, held art exhibitions in Beijing, became a folk singer, and now does installation art in Dali. He is self-taught by reading books.&quot; , always moving in your own direction, unlike us, who have to go to school, take exams, learn more things for exams, and suppress what you really want to learn. Being born in Beijing is my privilege, but this environment It’s just dragging me toward the average.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating and returning to China, Jiu Gu participated in a teaching aid company that provides innovative education, designing project-based learning courses to inspire students’ creativity. She didn&#39;t do it for long because she found that domestic innovation education was biased toward &quot;extremes.&quot; &quot;One type is the privilege of the rich. Even if they fail, they still have the resources to send their children to a good system; the other type is schools that provide re-education for low-income dropouts or migrant children. People in the middle are following the big trend.

Besides studying, Jiu Gu found something more interesting - living in a hippie community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1970s, the University of California, Davis, launched a community housing experiment and built a unique dormitory area in order to explore sustainable lifestyles. When Jiu Gu saw those small white hemispherical houses for the first time, she thought they were cool. There were gardens, vegetable fields, and chicken sheds between the houses. She then applied to move in and lived there for a total of three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The community is jointly shaped by the residents. There is a community meeting every week to collectively discuss public decisions and follow the consensus principle, &quot;Everyone agrees to do something before that thing can be done.&quot; Everyone gathers for dinner every weekday evening in the felt room in the community center and takes turns cooking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When faced with strong cultural differences at first, Jiu Gu felt alienated. She used a long and slow process to adapt and hoped to maintain a more equal cultural interaction. She would initiate Chinese culture in the community The activity uses original poetry recitation (slam poetry) and talk show to introduce &quot;who am I&quot; and &quot;what is China&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the first generation residents of the community were young people who participated in the hippie movement. When Jiu Gu moved in, the community still retained the critical spirit of sovereign culture and resisted sexism, racial discrimination, etc. &quot;It was different. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s not so confrontational, not so radical, and more sustained.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to China, Jiu Gu maintained her concern for public affairs and equal rights issues. After seeing a video of one person laughing causing the whole carriage to laugh, she initiated an action to spread laughter on the subway. After experiencing it, her feeling was, &quot;Don&#39;t suppress it when you want to laugh, laugh generously.&quot; Come out, I believe someone will respond.&quot; Feeling that there were few female rock singers, she interviewed women in &quot;atypical&quot; occupations to explore the gender barriers erected by their professions. She also joined a feminist group, participated in the creation and performance of the group&#39;s original play &quot;The Way of the Vagina&quot; based on Eva Ensler&#39;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, and created rap songs related to women&#39;s rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Jiu Gu’s career is not going well. She likes more creative jobs and is looking for entrepreneurial companies, such as making maker education and developing social communities for young people. The failure rate is very high. &quot;These companies themselves are not very profitable, and they are all going downhill in the end.&quot; In more than four years, she changed six or seven jobs. After she became unemployed again in 2019, she did not find a job for most of the year, whether it was an entrepreneurial company. She was not hired by any of the major Internet companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most direct job in front of her is that of an overseas study agency, with a commission of tens of thousands per order. However, Jiu Gu cannot agree with this job from her heart and feels it is meaningless. &quot;It belongs to a rich man.&quot; The shortcut is that as long as you have money, you can find someone to help you write materials and package yourself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, &quot;it is difficult to prove that studying abroad has a future&quot; when you return from studying abroad and work as a study abroad agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2020, Jiu Gu found a job in Shanghai. Her mother said that she was a traitor in Beijing. &quot;There are so many jobs in Beijing, can&#39;t you find any one?&quot; Jiu Gu changed this sentence into a joke. , &quot;The capital city cannot accommodate you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This job did not last long, and she was fired again two months later. She stopped looking for a job, opened her own marketing studio, and created a personal account to showcase her creativity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to increase her popularity, she decided to become an internet celebrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O05PXWYwVL73B42xg3PqMdxE8guoB35VPgt4PLOR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O05PXWYwVL73B42xg3PqMdxE8guoB35VPgt4PLOR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251342&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jiu Gu’s offline talk show stage&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;Keep it real&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When she first started writing articles and making videos, Jiu Gu found it difficult to attract traffic. One video only had dozens of views. She turned to talk shows in Shanghai and accumulated offline popularity. She had been giving English talk shows before, and the jokes she came up with were more in line with the English sense of language and humor. It took a lot of effort for her to re-cultivate the Chinese sense of language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One time, Jiu Gu failed at an offline open mic talk. When she got off the stage, she met Li Dan and asked him how to overcome the language difficulty. Li Dan suggested that she listen more to Guo Degang, so she watched Deyunshe&#39;s variety show to practice her accent, sense of language, learn talk show techniques, and study text structure. Her talk show business performance went from being watched by only 8 people to 30, 60, and 700 people, and her income began to exceed her job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She writes her unemployment, failure to be single, and failure by all worldly standards into talk show jokes, and uses self-dissolution to arouse the audience&#39;s resonance with negative emotions. But she claimed that she has never regretted the past. As she said in the video, &quot;When I say these failed experiences, it does not mean that I am not confident. It is precisely because of my confidence that I dare to use these failed experiences as material.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, as a talk show actor, Jiu Gu participated in the filming of an offline blind date documentary. Perhaps to increase the sense of conflict, the program team arranged a 61-year-old male blind date for 28-year-old Jiu Gu, Lao Wu, one year older than her father. After the show was aired, Jiu Gu&#39;s clip caused a lot of controversy and discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When greeting her, Lao Wu pretended to be humorous and said, &quot;Long time no see.&quot; and asked her, &quot;Do you think the Huangpu River is beautiful today?&quot; Jiu Gu replied directly, &quot;I can&#39;t see the river here.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Lao Wu put on a preachy attitude, &quot;Do you think women should be independent?&quot; Jiu Gu asked, &quot;What is independence?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Wu quoted from classics, &quot;Have you seen Simon... Beauvoir&#39;s &quot;The Second Sex&quot;? They are experimenting with how to turn women from the second sex into women as the first sex.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu did not accept the move, &quot;I don&#39;t think Beauvoir She knows better than me on the topic of women’s rights, and I don’t think I know better than her.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The performance in the show made Jiu Gu a little popular, and she began to insist on updating videos every day. Take advantage of the opportunity to make a popular account. The topic of women&#39;s rights discussed during the blind date became her first traffic point. Jiu Gu does not talk about theory or academics. A publishing house sent her feminist books. When making a short video, she bluntly said that she did not read it. “I personally extracted my understanding of women’s rights from my life experience.” I don’t think these so-called authorities with a higher social status than me understand my demands for women’s rights better than I do.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Jiu Gu believes that she advocates gender equality, and even wrote “Equality between men and women” &quot;You can do whatever you want, you can be a charmer, you can be a charmer, you can be a charmer.&quot; However, her views on gender rights continue to attract controversy. Some netizens accused her of being a &quot;feminist&quot;, while others called her a &quot;charmer&quot;. male&quot;. From time to time, Jiu Gu will &quot;retaliate&quot; to these comments. She found that &quot;gender opposition&quot; is indeed a traffic password. If there is opposition, there will be controversy, the number of controversial comments will be high, and it will be easy to be recommended by the algorithm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she used &quot;equal rights&quot;, she was deemed by the video platform to be &quot;not in line with community norms.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What attracts the most traffic is chasing hot spots. “Platform push traffic is directly related to hot spots. As long as it is a hot spot, it doesn’t matter how bad you say it is. There is a qualitative difference between having a hot spot and not having a hot spot. The traffic is at least The difference is 10 times.&quot; In September 2023, the hot spots that Jiu Gu chased include &quot;Xiucai&#39;s live broadcast room was blocked&quot;, &quot;Moutai Coffee&quot;, &quot;Li Jiaqi&#39;s live broadcast room overturned&quot;, etc. Although she chased hot spots, she said that not saying a word would go against her inner will. if. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the middle-aged and elderly aunts who reward talented people, Jiu Gu said, &quot;We women have worked hard for half our lives, so we should spend money to make ourselves happy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pulling others is also a kind of diversion. The way is, &quot;You can let their fans scold you and increase my popularity.&quot; For example, Jiu Gula once stepped on another Internet celebrity Ququ, &quot;She is still not as good as me because she teaches you to please others, but I teach you to be self-consistent... …Although I am single, have no money, and have bad skin, I am very self-contained. I can say whatever I want, and I can still be popular.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the accusations of trying to attract traffic and trolling, Jiu Gu is very Frank said, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s a marketing tool. It&#39;s what a marketer must do, and I&#39;m doing it openly.&quot; There were four big words written on the cover of the video where La Tia Qu Qu was involved - - &quot;Pull and step on each other&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Keep it real, I find everyone is too unreal.&quot; Jiu Gu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/3van6XHDJ2rAF6FAJ3i56jKkLcrL9GsFYAI2T7v0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;460&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/3van6XHDJ2rAF6FAJ3i56jKkLcrL9GsFYAI2T7v0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251349&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Offline blind date documentary &quot;I want to ask you if you dare&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Become a world star&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;One of the biggest features of Jiu Gu’s videos is that she appears without makeup and without filters. Her reason is also very real, &quot;I change my makeup every day. It&#39;s so tiring to put on makeup for 30 minutes every day, and I can&#39;t put it on well.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the bottom of almost every video, there are comments about her appearance. &quot;Wear something on, I can&#39;t stand it anymore.&quot; There are almost no female Internet celebrities who don&#39;t wear makeup. This has shaped the aesthetic and polite standards of the Internet. Some netizens will criticize even if they don&#39;t judge from the perspective of beauty and ugliness. Jiu Gu is disrespectful to others. “In public places, putting on makeup and tidying up is a sign of respect for yourself and others.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu firmly believed that this was not her problem, so she responded with a short video, &quot;If you think I don&#39;t respect you by not wearing makeup, then you don&#39;t deserve to be respected at all. If you don&#39;t like others and still have to say it, then there is something wrong with your eyes. People who like to comment on other people&#39;s appearance are not well-educated. At the end of the video, she used self-mockery to dispel the serious atmosphere, &quot;Unlike me, she is super beautiful without makeup. It is better not to wear makeup after putting it on.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The comment area may still be considered words. In a gentle place, online violence in private messages is rampant. Jiu Gu has received countless insults with swear words and dirty jokes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from their names, avatars, and account content, it’s hard to imagine that they would be so rude to others. Someone called “Wen Wen Zhi Advance and Retreat” said, “How dare your parents treat you like this?” Give birth.&quot; Someone whose profile picture was in a bachelor&#39;s uniform repeatedly called her &quot;ugly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu’s self-confidence prevented her from feeling hurt, but she didn’t want to be silent either. She posted several videos, advocating using “cyber hugs” to resist “cyber violence”, “I can’t control what other people say about me. Malice, I can also choose not to be affected by them, but actively spread kindness and push the world to be what I want.&quot; After a video about feminism caused a quarrel about &quot;gender opposition&quot; in the comment area, for Instead of creating confrontation, she replaced &quot;feminist rights&quot; with &quot;equal rights&quot;. Because she wanted to be a &quot;problem solver&quot;, she compiled a collection of videos called &quot;Resolving the Contradiction between Men and Women&quot; to explain prejudices about gender and rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu&#39;s popularity on the Internet has brought many orders to her marketing studio, and also added a lot of fun to her life. &quot;I&#39;m very monotonous in reality. I don&#39;t have an office or colleagues. If I don&#39;t go online, I rarely chat with people. I just go to a friend&#39;s shop.&quot; Even though I receive a lot of negative comments online, in reality Here, all interactions between people were suppressed in silence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu feels that she is very popular now. Four or five people recognize her on the street every day, and the traffic data of each video is good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But that’s not enough. Her goal is to become a world star. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What happens after becoming a superstar?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Influence the world, do valuable things, eliminate poverty, promote environmental protection, and empower women.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[运动员如何开启亚运生活？南周记者带你探营运动员村]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257474]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一起冲“亚” | 杭州亚运会专题报道]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257329]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 16:29:12&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;The 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou opens today (September 23), and the world’s attention is once again focused on China.
