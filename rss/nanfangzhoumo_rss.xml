The first job fair for the Class of 2024&quot;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a journalism student, when interviewing job fairs, I pay special attention to the situation of media units. However, after the four double-election meetings, I only saw one news website from Foshan, which was on September 28, 2023, at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The HR of this news website used the pseudonym Huang Li in the manuscript. After a brief introduction, I was allowed to sit aside and ask questions or observe on the spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a form on the table to record the basic information of job-seeking students. Nearly three hours have passed since the double selection meeting, and about twenty names have been filled in. The next column is &quot;Education,&quot; almost all of which are master&#39;s degrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I heard that Guangzhou Foreign Studies University (graduated this year) has 150 master&#39;s degrees in new communication.&quot; When she said this, Huang Li had a subtle smile on her face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seven minutes ago, she just rejected a girl&#39;s resume on the grounds that &quot;the resume was not suitable.&quot; A girl wants to apply for the social media platform operation of a news network, but she only has user operation experience in an ordinary company. It’s hard to tell what the essential difference between the two “operations” is, but it doesn’t prevent Huang Li from thinking that they don’t match each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I speculate that what she meant was that there were many students applying for jobs and she could choose as much as she wanted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In media reports, the number of graduates has been rising year after year - 9.09 million in 2021, 10.76 million in 2022, and 11.58 million in 2023 - making each year replace the previous year and become a new &quot; The most difficult employment season.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following interview with Xu Yang, the organizer of the double election conference, confirmed this point. He told me that in recent years, the supply and demand for jobs at the double election have become increasingly asymmetric. On the one hand, students&#39; enthusiasm for employment is actually increasing and the number of participants is increasing; on the other hand, the number of participating companies and the number of jobs released is decreasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jiamin, a master’s degree student in materials science from Sun Yat-sen University who has been mentioned in many reports, was someone I met at South China University of Technology. At that time, she was sitting outside the venue and resting against the wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Across the wall, countless red posters hang low, and there are one or two nervous-looking HRs in front of each booth. The aisles were narrow and cluttered, leaflets scattered everywhere, and it was dark and stuffy, like a trench. Li Jiamin smiled bitterly: &quot;Looking for a job requires physical and psychological torture.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employment is indeed like a battle, and everyone is prepared. But after each battle, it seems that everyone has lost their armor and lost their armor, with no victory or defeat in sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the bathroom of the same double election meeting, I also saw a young HR with a childish look on his face. She was still breastfeeding and asked me in a low voice to help close the outer door of the toilet. I was secretly surprised by how hard he worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the manuscript was released, Li Jiamin’s demands for salary were considered by some readers as “having not withstood the severe beatings of society”. Like a motto of the times, society always wants to “beat” every (quasi) social person. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Isn’t it normal for job seekers to want higher wages and better jobs? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, companies also have their own grievances. When Huang Li commented on today&#39;s young job seekers, her dissatisfaction could not be concealed in her words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For those of us who were born in the 1980s and early 1990s, our family conditions were not that good when we were young, so we all consciously cherished our jobs. But today’s young people have good family conditions, have no worries about food and drink, and have many choices of work. A lot. For them, the boss doesn’t fight against the west, right? As long as there is something that doesn’t fit the idea, just leave.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to improve the so-called recruitment retention rate, the job seeker’s hometown It became a question she repeatedly asked. From whether she is from Foshan, to whether she has relatives and friends living in Foshan, to her identification with the city of Foshan, she did not let go of any clues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Feng, who was at the same double selection meeting as Huang Li, is the head of the Guangzhou branch of a public examination training institution. On this day, his booth was almost always surrounded by people. This is very unusual for a small and micro enterprise with less than 50 employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is difficult to tell whether the crowd who gathered around him was attracted by the several &quot;Guangdong Written Examination Questions for Selected Students&quot; on the table or by the institution itself. Wu Feng seemed not to think about this problem. Before the interview, he gave me a set of real questions with the same enthusiasm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 5 pm, the interview came to an end and I was ready to leave. But he stopped me and asked about the end time of my internship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There&#39;s still one month left.&quot; I said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Then after your internship is over, you can sign up for an internship with us.&quot; Wu Feng said that they are short of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[弃养致死，那些变相杀害孩子的父母]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259466]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/QxImREUiIkRx7hQBSB6y1vFdwO3z0acGg8wkGHnx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/QxImREUiIkRx7hQBSB6y1vFdwO 3z0acGg8wkGHnx. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255438&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 5, 2022, children watched carp streamers in Koshigaya City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan . Today is Children’s Day in Japan. On this day, people hang carp streamers to pray for their children &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do parents do this? Becoming the murderer who personally caused the death of a child? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than 20 years, Japanese writer and journalist Haru Sugiyama has continued to investigate cases of parental abandonment in Japan. In many cases of abandonment that shocked society, young children eventually starved to death because they had no ability to take care of themselves. Or die of illness. These cases are driving the revision of Japan&#39;s Child Protection Act, but the situation of deaths due to abandonment remains serious. &quot;Most of the parents who have lost their children seem to be young people, prejudiced people or people with disabilities.&quot; In October 2023, 65-year-old Haru Sugiyama told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; in an email interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After children are born, does the world provide them with a safe and protected growth environment? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022 alone, 77 children died of abuse in Japan. Data from the Japan Children and Family Agency show that the number of child abuse consultations in Japan in 2022 has set a new record for 32 consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 23, 2023, a case involving the death of an abandoned baby was opened in Japan. 33-year-old Narumi Taniguchi, who works in a custom shop, gave birth to a baby girl alone on a street in Osaka City on January 30. She put the baby in a bag and abandoned it in a coin-operated locker. The baby eventually died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, the South Korean police discovered the remains of two infants in a refrigerator in an apartment in Suwon City. This incident attracted great attention in South Korea. South Korea&#39;s Ministry of Health and Welfare stated that as of July 18, there were more than 2,123 unregistered &quot;ghost babies&quot; in South Korea, and 249 of them were confirmed dead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What initially led Haru Sugiyama to investigate the phenomenon of &quot;child abandonment&quot; was a death case of a girl that shocked Japanese society. On December 10, 2000, a girl died in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. A pair of young parents put their 3-year-old daughter Mana Murata in a cardboard box at home for nearly 20 days. During this period, Mana barely ate, she eventually starved to death. At that time, Masami Murata, a mother, was pregnant and raising a 1-and-a-half-year-old son with her husband Tomonori Murata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugiyama Haru graduated from the First Faculty of Literature of Waseda University. He worked as a magazine editor and later became a freelancer. He writes reportage about parenting and parent-child issues, parents killing their own children, etc. His works include focusing on women. The poverty-stricken &quot;Documentary·Abuse - The Case of Two Children Abandoned to Death in Osaka&quot;, &quot;Thoughts from Child Abuse: How Society Pressures Families&quot; which explores the seriousness of family relationships in Japanese society, and &quot;Parenting Abandonment - Trapped Mothers&quot; The Chinese version of &quot;With the Neglected Daughter&quot; will be published in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SLJxrzToY7rJMxC11QGsHQ2fvLN081Dr1nnwGzrk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SLJxrzToY7rJMxC11QGsHQ2fvLN081Dr1nnwGzrk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255435&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugiyama Haru met the Muratas while they were serving their sentences and continued to correspond with them. Sugiyama Haru&#39;s child is one and a half years older than Mana. During the investigation, Sugiyama Haru &quot;the closer he came into contact with the case, the more unable he was to escape from his mother&#39;s perspective.&quot; After three and a half years of interviews and research on this case, Haru Sugiyama finally recorded this tragedy caused by the parenting environment in modern society in a way that is close to line drawing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother who abandoned her daughter was also a daughter who was abandoned since she was a child. In Japanese society with structural gender inequality, women&#39;s own needs are always ignored. When her daughter Mana&#39;s health condition worsened, Masami turned to her husband Tomonori for help. After being treated indifferently, the frustrated Masami no longer cared about her daughter&#39;s condition, but turned to her own mother Hideko, and flattered her husband who had already remarried. The mother expressed her love passionately and tried hard to imitate a &quot;well-behaved daughter in her mother&#39;s eyes.&quot; The 24-year-old Yamei was afraid of her haggard child and did not dare to touch her daughter, waiting for her child to die in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a society where mothers assume the main childcare responsibilities by default, lack of social awareness of childcare, and economic inequality, the tragedy of young children dying due to abuse and abandonment is not an isolated case. The circumstances and details in the &quot;Mana&quot; case have appeared repeatedly in subsequent &quot;childcare abandonment&quot; cases. The parents of these children often suffered violence or abandonment when they were young. They grew up in isolation. As adults, they still face tremendous pressure to survive and lack the ability to live stably in society. Haru Sugiyama said: &quot;Twenty years of continuous interviews have given me the feeling that cases of death by abuse are also affected by the contraction of social functions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BBiMfnmVj1JPaa4U1MSOG6MhKdmSSDILBNSDxy9o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/10/25/BBiMfnmVj1JPaa4U1MSOG6MhKdmSSDILBNSDxy9o.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is an interview between &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; and Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unable to Why don’t parents raising children seek help? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From the 1990s to the present, Japan’s &quot;childcare abandonment&quot; &quot;How has the phenomenon changed?&quot; What kind of fluctuations have the incidence rate shown, and what are the social and temporal reasons behind it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Currently, about 70 cases of killing children occur in Japanese society every year. Of course, in the period of social chaos after the war, children suffered even more. In the second half of the 1970s, there were approximately 200 cases of child abuse-related death each year. In the first half of the 1970s, in Japan, which was experiencing rapid economic growth, cases of babies being thrown into lockers at train stations often occurred. That was an era when a large number of young people moved from rural areas to cities. Such cases occurred frequently, probably because the society at that time did not provide cultural and institutional support for families. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have been paying attention to &quot;nurturing&quot; since the 1990s Children” topic, especially the phenomenon of “parenting abandonment” or improper parenting in Japan. What is the general appearance of the families you met during your research, such as their economic status? Are they all from the bottom of society? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Haru Sugiyama:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I interviewed six families that were torn apart by child abuse. Some of the children in these families were abused to death, and some were on the verge of death. . Some of the interviews involved me meeting directly with family members, while others I simply attended court proceedings. Objectively speaking, the families I interviewed were all facing financial difficulties. Even if they do not fall into the low-income group defined by society, these families are still in considerable financial difficulty. In addition, parents who lose their children seem to be more likely to be young, prejudiced, or disabled. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Childcare requires an investment of resources. British urban anthropologist Sandra Wallman believes that there are six types of necessary resources for family life: structural resources; land (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Residential&lt;/span>;); labor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Services&lt;/span >;); Capital (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Money&lt;/span>;); Organizational resources (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Resources that put structural resources into actual use&lt;/span>;); time, information, self-identity (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sense of belonging, self-esteem&lt;/span span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is necessary for people to realize that they are eligible and have access to these resources, otherwise it will be difficult to use rescue services. People who are living in difficulty should not kill their children, but should actively seek help and find ways to get out of their predicaments. It is important to prepare social resources, but I think it is more important to solve the problem of society clearly providing resources, but people are unable to take the initiative to ask for help. We must let everyone realize that if there are difficulties, we must use social resources and society to make adequate preparations for everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In these families, the mother is often the one who receives the most attention. What state are they usually in? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the cases I participated in, every mother suffered from mental trauma and serious psychological problems. Mothers who are physically and mentally healthy can use a variety of resources to get over the hump. The formation of psychological problems is related to the mother&#39;s lack of care in childhood and repeated violence during childhood and marriage. The experience of sexual violence can be particularly deeply traumatic. The mothers in many cases appeared to have experienced sexual violence in a situation where their self-esteem was not protected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in these cases, the aiding party failed to fully play its role. Clients often lack relevant knowledge and do not know that they can receive help. In 2010, a case occurred in Nishi-ku, Osaka City. The mother of the child is a full-time housewife. Although she received full social assistance when raising children, she did not even receive child support allowance after the divorce, and she never thought of seeking any social assistance. This really surprised me. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Reporter&#39;s note: In 2010, a mother in Nishi-ku, Osaka, Japan abandoned her 1-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl for 50 consecutive days. Causing them to starve to death. The mother left home, leaving her two children at home, and never came back.&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the differences among mothers with different education levels and social classes regarding seeking help? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have not investigated how differences in education and class affect families. But even mothers with outstanding knowledge and high education may not be able to seek appropriate assistance if their self-esteem is taken away and they no longer believe in their own worth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are also people who overcome difficulties with the help of wisdom. When difficulty intensifies, knowledge is even more needed to overcome it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A survey shows that about half of single mothers have difficulties in living. Even if women are eager to work, they often can only enter the workplace by doing part-time jobs and cannot become regular employees, which means that they cannot receive normal income. Sometimes, the mother&#39;s income alone is not enough to support her children. This is a problem that needs to be addressed as a society, not just mothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In many specific cases, I found that men’s fear of leaving the social class in which they grew up seems to have gradually become the reason why they are violent towards family members and violent towards their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese society is currently experiencing an economic downturn and social functions are gradually shrinking, which adds to the worries of being a parent. Continuous interviews over the past 20 years have given me the impression that cases of child abuse deaths have also been affected by the retrenchment of social functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Z4NhPACsTexDnNlEpygQrFeZAvgbSuBzce4y7338.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;654&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Z4NhPACsTexDnNlEpygQrFeZAvgbSuBzce4y7338.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 23, 2023, in Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, a 6-year-old boy was tortured to death and his body was dumped.

Has the proportion of husbands’ participation in family childcare changed? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Haru Sugiyama:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At present, Japan’s economic development is in a period of stagnation. I think society’s requirements for women are no longer limited to protecting the family. Probably only those who marry men with very strong financial ability are allowed to &quot;maintain the household&quot; - there are also a few families where the husband does not allow the wife to work outside the home even though the family is very poor. However, patriarchal values ​​are still very strong, and everyone still believes that family values ​​are in the hands of men, and women only provide assistance. This view also binds many people unconsciously. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the past, the proportion of fathers participating in child care in Japanese society should have increased. Twenty or thirty years ago, very few fathers went to kindergarten to pick up and drop off their children, but the situation now has improved a lot compared to that time, and everyone has begun to think that it is normal for fathers to pick up and drop off their children. More companies allow employees to take parental leave, and men&#39;s participation in childcare is much more common than before. The maternity leave system for men in large companies has gradually improved, and the success rate of men applying for maternity leave has also become higher. This means that a reform of society&#39;s consciousness is underway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a &quot;separated generation parenting&quot; in Japan similar to China (by Grandparents raising children) phenomenon? Is there a problem of &quot;left-behind children&quot; in Japan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; &quot;Skip-generation parenting&quot; has also happened in the past, but in today&#39;s Japanese society, grandparents and maternal grandparents often lose their jobs due to insufficient pensions. If you can&#39;t make a living, you still have to work in society. The situation may be different in each region, but the number of families that the previous generation could comfortably help with childcare was probably limited. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About the issue of &quot;left-behind children&quot;. In today&#39;s Japanese society, the number of young people going to work in big cities from small areas has decreased compared with before. The phenomenon of migrant workers used to be very popular, but now things have changed. In addition, most young people with financial difficulties seem to choose not to get married or have children. The declining birthrate is a major problem that Japanese society needs to face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Separate-generation parenting&quot; and &quot;left-behind children&quot; phenomena are also reflected It explains some Chinese people&#39;s understanding of childcare - childcare is a &quot;public matter&quot; for a family or even a family. This is different from the cultural understanding of childcare in Japan and South Korea. How do you understand this difference? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It turns out that in China, childcare is a &quot;public matter&quot; of the family. This is very interesting. It turns out that parenting has a public nature, which moved me very much. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, the nature of childcare is private. It gives me the impression that childcare is basically centered on the small family. In other words, the small family is not actually &quot;private&quot; but A minimalist “public” with responsibility. The restricted &quot;family&quot; is burdened with everything. The parent-child relationship is very close, and some children are controlled by their mothers. The problem of underage caregivers in Japan also needs to be solved urgently. In some families, parents lack basic abilities or have behavioral disorders or mental illnesses, and they have to be cared for by their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Whether it emphasizes the rescue of abused children or the treatment of abuse There is a lag in judicial punishment of behavior, and the damage has already been done. Is the socialization of childcare responsibilities important? What is Japan’s current progress in this regard? What support should be provided but is not? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You are right. The family system in modern society has become increasingly difficult to maintain with the development of economy and capitalist society. In the past, people relied on their family&#39;s industries to make a living, but in today&#39;s society, people have to spend money to buy labor, and the intergenerational nature of the family is no longer available. Although the era of having children for the family still has a certain influence on the present, the concept and form of family have changed.

They are also expensive and not readily available to women. The current situation is that the pregnant woman herself cannot decide whether to give birth to the baby.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang |&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For several days, Dahuang, Xiaohei and Xiaohuang did not show up, and the cat food placed in the corner remained untouched. This made the tea house in Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area untouched. The waiter Han Xue clenched her heart. She was worried that the three kittens would also die from poison given by &quot;bad guys&quot; as reported on the Internet. This guess was immediately corrected by the colleague next to him, &quot;None of us saw it with our own eyes, so we can&#39;t talk nonsense.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 20, 2023, Weibo netizens broke the news that a large number of stray cats died of poisoning in the Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area in Suzhou, and attached photos of the cat corpses. This information has been fermented on multiple platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, adding a new dimension to the controversy over stray animal management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 22, Liu Fang, a staff member of the Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area Management Office, confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that 14 cats were found dead in the park between October 10 and 16. However, after checking the surveillance, no evidence was found that the cat died of poisoning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 16, 2023, a Rottweiler dog bit a girl in Chongzhou, Sichuan. Some netizens linked the deaths of stray cats in Huqiu to dog bites of girls. However, Southern Weekend reporters found that most of the deaths of stray cats in Huqiu occurred before dogs bit girls, which means it is more likely to be an isolated incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the number of topics about killing stray animals on social networks has increased sharply recently. Qian Yefang, a professor at the School of Law at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, also noticed the &quot;dog-hating and cat-hating&quot; sentiment on social media. In her opinion, behind it is both the incitement of practitioners in the dog meat industry chain and a manifestation of the &quot;cat-kicking effect.&quot; : &quot;If you don&#39;t dare to express negative emotions to the strong, you vent them to the weak. They are passed down layer by layer, and finally passed to animals that cannot speak.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perennially calling for the introduction of the Companion Animal Protection and Management Act &quot;In addition, Qian Yefang conducted an experiment that lasted for more than three years in Haitian Community, Qiantang District, Hangzhou. Regarding the management of stray animals, the solution she gave is not novel, but there is still a long way to go: improving legislation, advocating civilized dog breeding, eliminating street culling, rational disposal, and more cooperation with private forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The scenic area has alerted the police&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area is located in the west of Suzhou. The main body is a hill with an altitude of 34.3 meters. There are two entrances and exits at the foot of the mountain in the north and south. Ji Jie, who works in the bonsai garden in the scenic area, told Southern Weekend reporters that the density of tourists at the north and south entrances and the bonsai garden is small and the terrain is flat, so they have become the main stronghold for stray cats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the feeding of Ji Jie and his colleagues, there are already more than a dozen cats living in the bonsai area. The scenic area management office also discovered the traffic potential of cats. In a short video released by the official Douyin account of Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area in April 2020, an orange cat named &quot;tiger&quot; appeared, whose name means the &quot;tiger&quot; of Huqiu. This video received 482 likes, which is more than ten times the number of likes for the flower and scenery video released in the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This sudden death made many employees feel sad. Ji Jie recalled that a colleague who had participated in the &quot;Small Animal Protection Association&quot; found that a cat that had been raised since childhood was convulsing and foaming, and he tried to rescue it by pouring water. But the kitten failed to save him in the end and bit him while struggling. In addition to the one that died in front of his colleagues, Ji Jie estimated that there were two or three cats missing from the bonsai area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Tiger Hill Scenic Area, most employees are on duty during the day, but cats often come out to be active in the evening when there are few tourists. Some cats die after nightfall, and their bodies are collected by cleaners in the early morning. Most people have not seen the corpses with their own eyes, but intuitively feel that the number of cats has decreased, and then they hear about &quot;poisoning&quot; on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aunt Mei who runs a stall near the south gate of the scenic spot also feels that the number of kittens has decreased. In the past, when I went to work every morning, the sound of Aunt Mei&#39;s trolley on the road would attract five or six cats begging for food. Shortly after the National Day holiday, the number of kittens in this batch was reduced to two or three. After that, she asked the cleaners every day if they had picked up the kitten corpses. After receiving consecutive affirmative answers, she was very sad and angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Fang said that the places where cats died were mainly concentrated in the South Gate, Xixi Huancui (West Garden), and Wanjing Villa (i.e. Bonsai Garden). From the map, these three areas are adjacent to each other and concentrated on the south side of the scenic spot. Ji Jie and other employees in the bonsai area mentioned that a few days before the cat&#39;s death, tourists complained about being scratched by cats in the bonsai area. Could there be a connection between the two? Apart from deliberate revenge, Ji Jie couldn&#39;t think of any reason to explain all this. Of course, he had no proof. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Fang said that the scenic spot has called the police and the police station has intervened in the case. The park also called in surveillance cameras and checked the ground, but no poison was found. &quot;If another cat is found dead later, we will ask the public security department to conduct a physical inspection immediately to determine whether this is a man-made incident.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, the scenic spot further strengthened the strength of on-site security inspection personnel, and promptly Clean up food residues scattered on the ground and discourage visitors from feeding small animals at will. On October 26, Liu Fang said that the scenic spot has organized a cat care volunteer service team to install smart cat boxes at points where cats come and go frequently, with dedicated management, remote monitoring, and fixed-point feeding to create a safe living environment for cats. At the same time, animal protection advocacy videos are played in scenic spots and cat care signs are produced. &quot;In the future, we will continue to pay attention to the living conditions of cats in the scenic area and provide them with necessary help and protection as much as possible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Rumors verified, whether true or false&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the dog bite girl incident , public opinion about hurting dogs and cats continues to ferment. Southern Weekend reporters verified some of the revelations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Hangzhou blogger broke the news that on October 18, his Schnauzer and Shiba Inu were stolen and killed by the landlord’s father. Among them, the Shiba Inu was skinned and chopped into pieces. Dog meat”. Three days later, the person involved deleted the relevant notes about the incident originally published in Xiaohongshu and canceled his account. The person involved declined the Southern Weekend reporter&#39;s interview invitation, saying that the matter was over and he did not want to be disturbed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person close to the blogger revealed that the two parties in the incident have been mediated by the Public Security Bureau, and the other party has publicly apologized and compensated for the losses. The parties involved will donate the compensation to charity projects for stray cats and dogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The authenticity of another revelation is controversial. On October 20, a Weibo user broke the news that the property management of Phoenix Garden Community in Wuhan beat to death &quot;three 4-month-old puppies and a pregnant cat mother&quot; on the evening of October 19, with the caption &quot;The murderer&quot; &quot;Photos of security guards and several dead cats and dogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 25, a staff member of the Phoenix Garden Community Property told a Southern reporter that the dog beating incident was a rumor. The real situation is that many community owners complained that stray cats and dogs were barking and disturbing the residents, so the property management organized security to drive away the stray animals instead of culling them. The property management company called 110 on the morning of October 20 to report the incident to the police at the Canglong Island Police Station in Jiangxia District and reiterated that no stray animals were killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being &quot;exposed&quot;, the community property management received a large number of calls in a short period of time. Some of them &quot;cursed and said we are not human beings&quot;, which affected the normal development of property management work. Southern Weekend reporters called some of these numbers, and most of them said they saw the breaking information on Xiaohongshu and WeChat groups rather than on Weibo. At present, Xiaohongshu cannot find relevant information, and the post may have been deleted by the person who broke the news. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some Weibo bloggers used image recognition software to identify the news that many reports of stray dogs being hunted and killed online were in fact “old news” or were copied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some news of harm to stray animals has been confirmed. On October 21, Sichuan Science and Technology Vocational College reported the killing of stray dogs in the student dormitory: two students were given detention for probation, and the police were transferred to the public security organs for processing; Sohu Clairvoyance reported that a resident in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province discovered that the lawn was being eaten while walking his dog in the community. A large amount of &quot;poison ham&quot; suspected to be stuffed with pills was released, and stray cats in the community died after accidentally eating it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Beware of the &quot;kicking cat effect&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Qian Yefang believes that in the complicated news about the death of stray animals, in addition to distinguishing the authenticity from the false, it is also necessary to define the nature of the behavior: Government The capture, containment and subsequent harmless disposal organized by the competent authorities are incomparable with the &quot;lynching&quot; and execution of stray animals by individuals or even the cruel killing of stray animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Yefang began to pay attention to the problem of stray animals in 2018. In her observation, whenever there is a dog biting incident, there will be a wave of support for culling stray animals on the Internet. In addition to the differences in the opinions of various parties, Qian Yefang believes that there are still some practitioners in the cat and dog meat or animal cruelty industry chain in the public opinion field who are muddying the waters and setting the pace, allowing voices that encourage extremes to gain the upper hand from time to time. This is actually the strong bullying the weak - the manifestation of the &quot;kicking the cat effect&quot; in social emotions. For example, if a person is criticized by his boss at work, he vents his depressed emotions on his wife when he gets home, and the wife vents on his children. The child had nowhere to vent his anger. When he saw a cat when he went out, he went up and kicked it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/9c19b8a38a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/9c19b8a38a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255950&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 18, 2022, in Zhengzhou, Henan, the 32nd &quot;Zhengzhou Adoption Day&quot; offline charity event was held. Volunteers found new homes for stray cats and dogs. Visual China | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike food animals, cats and dogs, as companion animals, have received special legal protection from slaughter in some countries and regions. The two seemingly incompatible groups on the issue of stray animals also have a consensus. For example, Qian Yefang has been calling for the introduction of the &quot;Companion Animal Protection and Management Law&quot;, in which the focus of management is civilized dog breeding, which can not only reduce conflicts between humans and dogs, but also reduce the occurrence of stray animals from the source, which is beneficial to animal welfare. If you compare stray dogs with stray cats, the specific disposal procedures are different. Compared with stray dogs, the risk of stray cats injuring people is relatively low. &quot;So the act of killing stray cats has no legal system support, nor moral or traditional support. It is a naked atrocity.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, stray cats have strong reproductive capabilities and may pose a threat to small wild animals such as birds. The Trap Neuter Release (TNR) model is currently being promoted. In Qian Yefang’s TNR practice, she also found a low-cost way to sterilize stray cats: working with nearby pet hospitals Cooperate to promote the hospital among pet parents in the community. In return, the hospital can perform two sterilization surgeries for free every month. For more than two sterilization surgeries, the hospital charges 100 yuan for female cats and 50 yuan for male cats, which is very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;(Except for Qian Yefang, all others in the article are pseudonyms.

They had been held in Gaza for 17 days before being released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is the second batch of hostages released by Hamas. On October 20, also on the Gaza border, Hamas released a mother and daughter from the United States, Judith Lanan and Natalie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The hostage issue puts Netanyahu in a dilemma. Israel wants to completely eliminate Hamas and establish a new order in Gaza, while Hamas The hostages were used as bargaining chips in an attempt to interfere with Israel&#39;s ground offensive plan.&quot; According to Zou Zhiqiang, a researcher at the Middle East Studies Center of Fudan University, the two sides are still in an ongoing game and compromise is extremely difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth mentioning that Qatar mediated the release of two consecutive batches of hostages. U.S. President Joe Biden publicly expressed his gratitude to Qatar after two American hostages were rescued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 25, Qatar Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed once again responded to the progress of hostage negotiations. He said that negotiations are still actively underway and both sides have made some progress and breakthroughs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the ever-changing Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the small Gulf country of Qatar is walking in the flames of war and mediating on the hostage issue. People can&#39;t help but wonder: Why is it a &quot;small country&quot; like Qatar? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The released hostages are targeted&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the deep night, accompanied by Hamas soldiers, two female hostages were Handed over to staff wearing ICRC uniforms. Two Hamas soldiers covered their faces with black veils and held steel guns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before leaving, one of the hostages turned around and shook hands with the Hamas gunman in farewell, saying &quot;Shalom.&quot; In Hebrew, &quot;Shalom&quot; means &quot;peace.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of October 23, 2023, Hamas shared a video of the release of hostages. The two hostages released in the video are 79-year-old Nurit Cooper and 85-year-old Yochiri Lifshitz. They live in Kibbutz Nir Oz, Israel, close to the Gaza border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 7, Hamas launched the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; operation. 1,200 Hamas armed gunmen crossed the border and launched attacks in southern Israel. And took away a large number of hostages. Cooper and Lifshitz were also among the hostages kidnapped, along with their husbands, who are still being held in Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Israeli military said that there are 222 hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, &quot;most of whom are still alive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In fact, through the raid on Israel, Hamas&#39;s main military goal has been achieved. The kidnapping of hostages is mainly to make Israel have concerns and facilitate future bargaining. &quot;Zou Zhiqiang analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Lifshitz&#39;s account, after being kidnapped, she was taken into a vast network of tunnels under Gaza that &quot;looked like a spider web.&quot; They ate the same food as the Hamas guards - pita bread, cheese and cucumbers. To ensure the hostages are healthy, a doctor will check on them every two or three days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When asked why she shook hands with the gunman, Lifshitz said the hijackers were nice to her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Hamas, the hostages were released for &quot;humanitarian reasons.&quot; However, in the opinion of the interviewed experts, Hamas&#39;s release of the hostages has the dual purpose of exerting pressure and showing a compromise posture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Under the dual pressure of Israel&#39;s continued air strikes and the pressure of its soldiers, Hamas is looking for opportunities to threaten the release of hostages in exchange for Israeli military concessions. &quot;Zou Zhiqiang pointed out, &quot;So far, the hostages released are all non-combatants and women.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the first hostage released by Hamas The hostages are dual American-Israeli citizens and are from Chicago. The two were visiting relatives in Israel when they were captured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The hostages Hamas chose to release are targeted.&quot; Yu Guoqing, a researcher at the Institute of West Asian and African Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Hamas sent We hope that the United States will put as much pressure on Israel as possible to allow it to retain a certain amount of leeway in ground military operations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 18, Biden visited Israel. Brigade, in addition to expressing his staunch support for Israel, Biden also discussed the hostage issue with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden emphasized that ensuring the safe return of American hostages is his top priority. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But to this day, dozens of foreigners, including 11 Americans, are still detained in Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Currently, hostages are the most valuable bargaining chip in the confrontation between Hamas and Israel. In the case of asymmetry in strength between the two sides, Hamas will make full use of it. This card opens up the situation.&quot; Yu Guoqing analyzed, &quot;When to release the hostages and how many to release at one time, Hamas will not obey Qatar&#39;s orders.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt; strong>;Suitable&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Mediator&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gaza since Hamas raid on Israel Encountered ruthless rocket bombardment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the evening of October 25 to the early morning of October 26, the Israel Defense Forces launched a large-scale ground attack on the Gaza Strip and conducted approximately 250 air strikes within 24 hours. Netanyahu said in a televised speech, &quot;We are pouring the fire of hell on Hamas... and this is just the beginning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;And Qatar, thousands of miles away from Gaza, has become lively after the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, with dignitaries from various countries arriving in droves. Among those hurriedly visiting Qatar were US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French President Macron’s special envoy for Lebanon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dignitaries from various countries gathered in Qatar, and the hostage issue became an unavoidable topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gaza is the stronghold of Hamas, which hides hostages in batches in huge underground tunnels. &quot;We don&#39;t have specific data on every house and street in Gaza.&quot; Michael Milstein, who has worked in the Israeli military intelligence system for 20 years, warned, &quot;This is the most difficult hostage situation that Israel has ever encountered in its history.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Rescuing hostages is extremely difficult, and mediation has become an important way for hostages to gain freedom. In this context, Qatar’s unique role as an international mediator has become increasingly prominent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hasni Abidi, director of the Geneva-based Center for the Study of the Arab and Mediterranean World, pointed out that &quot;there are not many mediators, and Qatar is the most suitable mediator. This small country has no regional agenda of its own and does not care about the political uses of mediation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Qatar has deep pockets, extensive contacts, and a good rapport with the United States. It maintains close contacts with Hamas, which provides it with a unique advantage in mediating the hostage crisis,&quot; Yu Guoqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar is one of the 18 &quot;important non-NATO allies&quot; of the United States. Al Udeid Air Base, located 35 kilometers southwest of Doha, the capital of Qatar, is one of the largest U.S. military bases overseas and the forward command center of the U.S. Central Command, with approximately 10,000 U.S. troops and 100 military aircraft deployed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2021, the United States hastily withdraws its troops from Afghanistan, and Al Udeid Air Base will assume the role of a &quot;transit hub.&quot; According to statistics, the United States has withdrawn 123,000 people from Afghanistan, of which about 57,000 were transited through Qatar. In fact, the withdrawal agreement between the United States and the Taliban was originally reached in Doha. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In addition to relying on the United States, Qatar also has close contacts with Hamas, Hezbollah and other &#39;radical organizations&#39; in the eyes of Western countries.&quot; Yu Guoqing said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar is an important economic supporter of Hamas and has provided a large amount of aid, investment, humanitarian and infrastructure construction to Gaza. Didier Billion, deputy director of the French Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies, pointed out that Qatar provides $30 million in monthly financial support to Hamas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar not only maintains close economic ties with Hamas, but also provides political asylum. In 2012, Qatar’s Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani visited Gaza. This is the first head of state to visit Gaza since Hamas seized control of the region in 2007. Also starting in 2012, Hamas leaders began to reside in Doha. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Struggling between the United States and its hostile forces, Qatar&#39;s role seems contradictory, but in fact it is inseparable from the &quot;tolerance&quot; of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The United States&#39; Middle East strategy has inherent flaws. On the one hand, the United States hopes to rely on its alliance system to achieve its Middle East intentions, but on the other hand, it pulls one faction to fight against the other. It has created all kinds of enemies, especially various sub-international organizations and non-state armed groups.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang analyzed, &quot;When the United States cannot use force to suppress it to achieve diplomatic goals, it must find a middleman to mediate, and Qatar plays the role of Such a key role.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Qatar&#39;s ambitions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar is surrounded by sea on three sides, with its southern land bordering Saudi Arabia, like a small boat docked On the west coast of the Persian Gulf. Similar to the shape of its land, Qatar is like a &quot;fast and flexible boat&quot; in international diplomacy, balancing among different forces and playing the role of messenger and mediator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Actively mediating the Palestinian-Israeli hostage crisis is just a microcosm of Qatar&#39;s role as an &quot;enthusiastic&quot; international mediator. In just over a month, Qatar has made three consecutive attempts to act as an intermediary for hostage rescues, prisoner exchanges and other activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 16, 2023, the Qatari government announced that after months of mediation, Russia agreed to release four Ukrainian children. Embassy in Moscow, taking a different route back to Ukraine. Qatari officials said in a statement that the repatriation of the four children was &quot;only the first step.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, the United States and Iran officially exchanged five prisoners detained in the United States and Iran, and the prisoner exchange took place in Doha. In fact, the success of this negotiation is inseparable from Qatar&#39;s mediation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to public reports, negotiations between the United States and Iran were held in Doha. During the negotiations, representatives from both sides did not meet each other and stayed in different hotels, while Qatar, the middleman, ran on both sides and acted as a sounding board. After at least eight rounds of airborne talks, the United States and Iran finally reached a prisoner exchange agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar has a land area of ​​only about 11,500 square kilometers and a total population of 3 million. How can such a small country be frequently active on the international stage and play a role far beyond its own capabilities in major conflicts? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the 1990s, Qatar wrote the &#39;diplomacy&#39; strategy into its constitution. Since then, it has been adopting a multi-faceted strategy to deal with various forces. Balance. At the same time, Qatar is extremely rich in oil and natural gas resources, and its strong financial resources provide strong support for Qatar’s diplomatic strategy.&quot; Yu Guoqing analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The interviewed experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that Qatar&#39;s &quot;small country, big diplomacy&quot; strategy is not only based on the needs of its own survival, but also conceals huge diplomatic ambitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Middle East is intertwined with contradictions and conflicts are frequent. &quot;Caught between regional powers, Qatar is unwilling to be passively controlled by others and choose sides among different forces. For security reasons, Qatar hopes to use high-profile diplomatic mediation in exchange for protection from relevant countries to ensure its own national security. and political security.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang said, &quot;In fact, the reason why Qatar is not afraid of getting burned is largely because it has the big tree of the United States on its back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;More importantly, using a &#39;grand diplomacy&#39; attitude to mediate in geopolitical crises can further highlight Qatar&#39;s regional importance and international influence.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang further said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Qatar is not entirely following the lead of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the United States has supported Israel, but Qatar has not completely followed the footsteps of the United States. On the contrary, Qatar&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned that Israel bears full responsibility for the continued escalation of the situation and that the international community urgently needs to stop Israel&#39;s violations of international law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Qatar has its own considerations and will not completely follow the interests of the United States.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang pointed out, &quot;adopting a multi-sided bet strategy to balance between different forces , rather than one-sidedly surrendering to major powers or following allies, is an important basis for Qatar to play the role of a middleman. Only by being good at dancing can Qatar have greater room for mediation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But such balanced diplomacy is not without risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2017, several Middle East and North African countries, led by Saudi Arabia, accused the Qatari government of &quot;supporting extremist forces, intervening in other countries&#39; internal affairs, and creating regional instability.&quot; It suddenly announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed embargo and blockade measures on Qatar, including closing borders and airspace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The crisis of severing diplomatic relations lasted for nearly four years before it ended. It was not until January 2021 that Saudi Arabia and other countries announced that they had reached reconciliation with Qatar and officially restored comprehensive diplomatic relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 17:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[应该关掉各种班级群，给家长“减负”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259533]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a seventh-grade teacher from Zhuge Liang Middle School in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province commented to his students &quot;the best in the class&quot; while correcting homework. Oops, are you an orphan?&quot; He then took a photo and posted it in the &quot;Grade 7 Class 9&quot; WeChat group. Subsequently, the local education bureau issued a notice of criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course it seems that the teacher has no teacher ethics when he said this. The real problem in this matter is that the teacher really thinks that it is the parents&#39; business to correct students&#39; homework and teach students cultural classes. She was really angry at the parents: &quot;Why don&#39;t you teach your children or grade their homework?&quot; The reason why she scolded her was not to scold the students, but to scold the parents and put pressure on them. In fact, in today&#39;s education, she is by no means the only teacher who thinks so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the inevitable factor behind this accident, and this is the real problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I still remember that when I was a child, the teacher would assign homework. It was always after class. The teacher would write on the blackboard, and I would circle it with my book or memorize it in my notebook. This is something every student can accomplish. Do your homework as soon as you get home. If you don&#39;t know how to do it, you may be asked, or you may leave it alone. Your parents may sign it, but they will definitely not check whether the homework is done correctly one by one. Submit your homework the next day and the teacher will correct it. If you are wrong, ask for correction and hand it in with the next day&#39;s homework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now everything has changed. Tutoring and correcting homework have become the responsibility of parents. The teacher assigns homework in the group every day, and parents see it and help their children complete it as required. Although the Ministry of Education has repeatedly warned not to assign homework to parents, the effect is not great. Teachers still give assignments, and parents still need to help with homework, correct homework, and attend class. Among these, Internet-based home-school contact plays a big role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are of course many benefits to using the Internet and smartphones to communicate between home and school. Teachers and parents can communicate at any time without being restricted by time and location, which is convenient and fast. Teachers can assign homework in the group to prevent students from forgetting, and can also publish students&#39; learning status, homework completion status, test scores, etc. Parents can also keep abreast of their children&#39;s learning status and provide timely feedback to the teacher. In short, through WeChat groups, QQ groups, DingTalk groups and other platforms, parents and teachers can interact better and participate in their children&#39;s education process together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the advantages and disadvantages of anything actually lie in the purpose. If the purpose is changed, the advantage may become a disadvantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In various home-school groups, privacy issues such as sending wrong messages are not a big deal. The key issue is that these Internet channels are a channel that effectively distributes pressure and work from teachers to parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that love in the past was beautiful. You had to wait repeatedly to send a love letter. Although it was backward, it was romantic. Nowadays, WeChat contact is constant, making many people feel that they have no space of their own. It is said in the movie &quot;Mobile Phone&quot;: Mobile phones are originally for convenience. Without them, people are quite free. With them, people become kites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Channels will affect content, and tools will affect behavior. Efficient electronic channels have forced parents to have nowhere to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, parents could say: The child didn’t tell me when he got home, so I don’t know. Now that parents no longer have this space, teachers will shift all the pressure onto parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The teacher is the group leader, to some extent the leader of a small organization. When teachers communicate with parents one-on-one, they are relatively equal, but when communicating in a group, teachers will have many supporters. . Whoever the teacher praises or criticizes in the group will create pressure in the class, and then this pressure will be transmitted to parents and children. In this incident, the teacher also took photos and posted them in the group to unscrupulously put pressure on parents. This will force parents to tutor their children, increase the pressure on their children&#39;s studies, and ultimately form a heavier academic burden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, when there are too many WeChat groups and QQ groups, it will also put a lot of pressure on teachers, add some extra work to them, and increase their workload. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reducing the frequency and convenience of home-school contact can reduce the tasks and pressure teachers pass on to parents. Obviously, if there were no electronic channels and groups, it would be impossible for teachers to call parents one by one to assign homework. These tasks and pressures return to the teachers, and the teachers cannot complete them. In the end, the students&#39; academic burden is reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people may worry that without efficient communication and interaction channels, what should we do if our children&#39;s learning declines? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, from a large policy level, this choice has been completed. Some people believe that in the process of implementing the &quot;double reduction&quot; reform, on the one hand, it is necessary to &quot;reduce the excessive academic burden&quot;, have more outdoor activities, and have less homework; on the other hand, it is necessary to &quot;study well&quot; and let children learn in their interests. You can learn more, faster, and better in a state of exuberance. &quot;Load reduction&quot; cannot be simplified to &quot;reducing academic work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of strategy of having both fish and bear&#39;s paw is very safe in terms of attitude. Neither side is offended, both sides want it, and they do not bear any responsibility for the consequences. Children&#39;s burdens are still heavy because they have to &quot;study well&quot;; children do not learn well because they have to &quot;lighten their burdens.&quot; There are changes because we need to &quot;reduce the burden&quot;; there are no changes because we need to &quot;learn well&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is impossible to have your cake and eat it too. For most people, learning requires high-intensity brain operation. The more you learn, the less time you have for this high-intensity operation. The only way to reduce the burden on primary school and junior high school students is to lower their academic standards. In fact, the high school entrance examination in many places has lowered the distinction, and everyone&#39;s scores are about the same. This is lowering academic standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe that this will drive parents to let their children continue to answer questions and improve their proficiency, but this may not be the actual situation. Some people&#39;s strategy for reducing returns is to invest less. For example, in the past, people who ate from a big pot and worked hard could be promoted and become model workers. However, most people would choose to lie flat in the face of such disproportionate input and output. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having a group to establish close ties can indeed enhance academic performance, but at the same time, it will cause the problem of overburdening parents. Since the main goal of the policy is to &quot;reduce the burden&quot;, it should not &quot;increase the burden&quot; on the children by &quot;adding burdens&quot; to parents. At this time, the advantage of establishing close ties between home and school through groups becomes a disadvantage. Then, it is a logical choice to reduce the frequency of home-school contact, close various class groups, or even prohibit Internet-based home-school contact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[通向世界的小作坊]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259455]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/d1QYAQWbkA9N7KOCeuSnuYX6WDwwSJcgAEI1NnpD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/d1QYAQWbkA9N7KOCeuSnuYX6WDwwS JcgAEI1NnpD. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255428&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Young people working in small workshops in the suburbs of Yiwu&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Shijie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beilun, Ningbo, the hometown of photographer Wang Shijie, has a port area of ​​Ningbo Port just offshore to the north.

In the family-style workshop painted with cement and stacked with red bricks, he saw the resilience of the private small commodity economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Small workshops are concentrated on the outskirts of the city, and their appearance is separated from the majestic commercial city in the city by decades: an old house, a few countertops, and a few rows of simple machines are a factory. In order to maximize the use of the space inside the house, the original partition wall and the door to the back room were removed.

When the business is good, it expands into a small workshop. For a place of the same size, the rent in the suburbs is only half that in the city. Some small workshops have stores in the Trade City or Binwang Market, and can directly contact the international market with customers; those without stores mainly rely on the network of relatives and friends to receive orders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yiwu attracts a large number of outsiders to come here to &quot;make a living&quot;. Most family-owned workshops are staffed by foreigners, and even workshops run by locals in Yiwu will hire migrant workers. Some migrant workers also prefer to work in small workshops - to receive wages in a factory, you have to rely on the factory&#39;s income. When the market is not good, it is difficult to get wages; when money is urgently needed, it is difficult for the factory to take care of it alone.

Coupled with the blessings of Liu Lin, Liu Dan and other veteran actors in the industry, it is difficult to let People believe that this drama will be so popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Bionic World&quot; is a science fiction theme.

As a result, the series uses six unit stories to present the joys and sorrows between androids and ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/d18b765ab70f48cab8152caa9e825840.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/d18b765ab70f48cab8152caa9e825840.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255886&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In narrative mode In terms of gameplay, it is similar to &quot;Crime Hunting Illustrated Book&quot; and &quot;Gate of Rebirth&quot;, using the protagonist&#39;s special skills to connect one strange case after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The undercurrent of the series is that androids encounter serial murders. During the investigation, Cheng Nuo also discovered that the case was related to his mother&#39;s accidental fall from the building, thus uncovering a shocking secret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Simply speaking from the human tragedy reflected in each case, &quot;The Bionic World&quot; is remarkable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/7928f4ed33e730c2e4fb5ca03e72b3c6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/7928f4ed33e730c2e4fb5ca03e72b3c6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255885&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Played by Liu Lin Chen Xinhui, the mother of Chen Xinhui, lacked company for her son Fang Yuan, so she ordered a bionic person who looked exactly like herself to take care of her son when she was busy at work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I didn’t expect was that Chen Xinhui’s harsh attitude toward Fang Yuan was seen as malicious harm in the eyes of the androids. The latter began to deliberately imitate Chen Xinhui&#39;s speech and behavior, and eventually replaced Chen Xinhui and even imprisoned her in the basement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/ed9902970e8c08b7afc15da444992380.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/ed9902970e8c08b7afc15da444992380.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255890&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An accident, Chen Xinhui escaped from the basement and wanted to take her son back from the android, but she died at the hands of the android during the fight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Yuan, who had been kept in the dark, finally realized that his mother, whose temperament had changed drastically, turned out to be a bionic person. In order not to lose this &quot;other mother&quot;, Fang Yuan asked Cheng Nuo and others He lied that he accidentally killed someone and the victim was an android. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paradoxical case at the beginning of the chapter depicts Chen Xinhui&#39;s helplessness and desolation as a mother, Fang Yuan&#39;s struggle and loneliness as a son, and the kindness and extreme of the android as the middleman, all of which are tragic and moving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/7198c3c26c616e055741ff27eb2369a6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;463&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/7198c3c26c616e055741ff27eb2369a6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255888&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lin is here This person plays two roles without being overstretched.

Although her appearance is short, she leaves a deep impression on people. impression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emotional touch brought by this unit story is also reflected in the touching family bond between the bionic little girl and her adoptive parents, and also in the sweet romance between the lonely sailor and the bionic lover, but in the end In a story that ends in tragedy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/2c9a2a556aeba45da6db1641c5f1b996.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/2c9a2a556aeba45da6db1641c5f1b996.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255889&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course it is Domestic dramas are good at producing many popular dramas. It&#39;s just that &quot;The Bionic World&quot; only focused on forcing tears, forgetting to solidify the foundation of the science fiction setting, and also went out of its way to foreshadow suspense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a science fiction drama, in addition to the future background explained in the beginning, the persuasive style of the main film is close to that of modern urban crime dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting place inside the &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; organization is like a simply decorated office; the crime scene outside the city looks like a shanty town waiting to be demolished. It may seem excessive to use the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; style of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; to ask for it, but using slightly softer science fiction dramas such as &quot;Relative Universe&quot; and &quot;The Handmaid&#39;s Tale&quot; as comparison objects can fully highlight this The show&#39;s perfunctory attitude in setting up scenes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/7a42a0253179c920aab4f67ca67eafab.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/7a42a0253179c920aab4f67ca67eafab.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255891&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you zoom in to As for the details of the science fiction setting, &quot;The Bionic World&quot; also has many flaws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the movie &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; with a similar setting, we glimpsed the tragic experience of robots through Spielberg&#39;s lens. Discarded after use, they are slandered as murderers, treated as garbage, and put on the execution ground for humans to vent their hatred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Bionic World&quot; explains the smuggling activities in a few words, and in less than ten minutes of transition, it hints that ordinary people consume the flesh and blood of bionic people. But these pitiful black corners are mostly vague and obscure, unable to provide us with a clear perspective on the unknown world of bionic people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/0640ad6575323f3b716e67858042940f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;445&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/0640ad6575323f3b716e67858042940f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255892&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you look If you don&#39;t understand the suffering of a group of people, how can you fully sympathize with and treat each other with compassion? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To put it bluntly, the science fiction setting is just a certain strategy of &quot;The Bionic World&quot;. It uses elements that are extremely rare in domestic dramas to try to explore the human nature motif that has been repeated many times. This also explains that this drama is not only inconsistent in terms of science fiction, but also extremely difficult to grip people&#39;s hearts in the suspense section. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The heroine An Qiu, played by Cheng Nuo and Wen Qi, investigates the serial murderer of androids. During this process, Cheng Nuo gradually discovered An Qiu&#39;s true identity, and the latter was gradually lost under the brainwashing of similar androids. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/9fa39f3949d4688ae37ac9e055c55bbb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/9fa39f3949d4688ae37ac9e055c55bbb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255893&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Nuocong An investigator who was prejudiced and jealous of androids finally revealed his true colors and turned into a gray figure who had accidentally killed androids. We can hardly see the changes in his personality and the contrast between before and after. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Song Weilong&#39;s slightly immature acting skills prevent him from grasping the details delicately; on the other hand, there are problems with the plot setting. The arrangement and revelation of suspense rely too much on the villain Yin Tianhong played by Li Hongqi in the climax. Part of it is talking to myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for An Qiu&#39;s transformation from a seemingly ordinary psychologist to the most critical role in the whole drama, it was also revealed too early and too hastily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/afd4d7660d48d6afe60bd8f86db16bc4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/afd4d7660d48d6afe60bd8f86db16bc4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255894&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the sixth At the end of the episode, which is also the middle part of the whole drama, we learned the answer to the mystery from the rivalry between An Qiu and Yin Tianhong. Even in many scenes before this, An Qiu&#39;s true identity was clumsily revealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You must know that the two biggest mysteries in &quot;The Bionic World&quot; are that Cheng Nuo accidentally killed someone and An Qiunai is a bionic human. These two mysteries involve the emotional tearing of the male and female protagonists, and also reflect the subtle complexity of human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/1ed929dc9f100b6aa2d32f0b58009de0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;448&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/1ed929dc9f100b6aa2d32f0b58009de0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255895&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the final Judging from the presentation effect, the reconciliation between Cheng Nuo and An Qiu is more like a &quot;love trick&quot; without the profound speculation brought by science fiction settings such as bionic man and initial obsession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The science fiction works of domestic film and television dramas have begun to show their talents. Whether it is the movie &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot; series or the live-action series &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, they are all outstanding works recognized by the audience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quality of &quot;The Bionic World&quot; is indeed poor, but I prefer to regard it as a trial and error for domestic science fiction dramas to mature. After all, without enough &quot;The Bionic World&quot;, how could there be more mature &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot; and &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[小镇阿姨们想象着法国织的毛线比基尼，真的到了法国]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259464]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/O7eoYOJsmylGZtTu62RB7REoLUC90XiaIygYcmW1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/O7eoYOJsmylGZtTu62RB7REoLUC90XiaIyg YcmW1. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255441&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 2023, Hu Yinping went to Paris to participate in the Paris Internationale Art Fair (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;International Paris Art Fair &lt;/span>;), this is her third exhibition in France for Xiaofang’s art project.

Hu Yinping graduated from the Sculpture Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts with a master&#39;s degree. She used the income from sculptures sold as &quot;Qiao Xiaohuan&quot; as a commercial sculpture artist to subsidize Xiaofang&#39;s production. The original reason for all this was that she wanted to collect her mother&#39;s time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Hu Yinping returned to her hometown in Sichuan and saw that her mother was packed up by two large bags of hats in a year and purchased at a low price. She wanted to buy her mother&#39;s hat, but her mother refused. After returning to Beijing, she asked a friend to play the role of &quot;Xiao Fang&quot; and made up the identity of &quot;Xiao Fang&quot; as &quot;the Chinese CEO of a French company&quot;. &quot;Xiao Fang&quot; would come forward to buy her mother&#39;s hat at a higher price. She knitted hats as she pleased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are no secrets in the town. The aunts in the town found Hu Yinping&#39;s mother and wanted to join the production of Xiaofang&#39;s project. In the 1990s, silk cutting was once a way for aunts in the town to make money to support their families. After experiencing collective layoffs from state-owned silk cutting factories, most of these aunts became the eliminated urban surplus labor force. Now knitting wool is a way for them to pass the time and earn pocket money. The way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now the Xiaofang project has expanded to more than fifty knitting aunts, including &quot;Xiaofang&quot;, &quot;Snow White Pigeon&quot;, &quot;Security&quot;, &quot;United Nations&quot; and &quot;Standard Configuration&quot; and other five stages of different years. Proposition creation. Behind the creation lies the complex work of the artist. In sharp contrast to the work utopia created by Hu Yinping, is the cruel art market with clearly marked prices that artists face. Until now, the aunts still don’t know the origin of this “French company”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/LT7q0TrkhxvWAsXZeC8f8crHUii9urnoWrVGYZky.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/LT7q0TrkhxvWAsXZeC8f8crHUii9urnoWrVGYZky.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255440&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Yinping&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is Hu Yinping&#39;s account: &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The aunt is very happy, the artist is very tired&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I will be happier every time I go to Paris to organize an exhibition. Because Xiaofang’s project itself has something to do with France. Every time we have a project, we tell the aunties that the French company needs orders, invite the aunties to make it, and then pay the corresponding fees. This French company has always existed in the hearts of the aunties. At the beginning of production, we told our aunts that there was a beach in France and we were going to do a woolen bikini show on the beach. They imagined a beach and made a set of woolen bikinis for themselves and their families. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xiaofang has a lot of such exchanges and work internationally. This French exhibition is aimed at There are more professional art professionals, corresponding to a large number of curators and museum directors. I also hope that Xiaofang will enter into a deeper and more international exchange and dialogue. To the public, Xiaofang may be a relatively warm story, but to me it is a very specific work. Behind Auntie, our entire team works very rigorously and professionally. Everyone can enter and understand this work in any way of their own, but it itself is the background of contemporary art works. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The knitted works of the aunts are all placed in my warehouse in a village near Beijing. Aunts are very happy, but artists have a harder time. Xiaofang&#39;s team of six people needs to handle a lot of specific and trivial tasks. The aunties don&#39;t care. The time for their weaving is not fixed. They choose the threads and take them home to make them, and get some fees from it, whether it is to make money, kill time, or the so-called &quot;thinking&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before I called you just now, I was in contact with the art museum about the transportation and goods for this exhibition. Shan, to integrate all the work of Auntie, we need to do some very specific and serious work. In fact, the workload is quite heavy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For Xiaofang&#39;s project, there are too many times when the economy cannot sustain it. Yang Xiaofang spends every year It costs a lot of money, and I rely on selling sculptures of &quot;Qiao Xiaohuan&quot; to support Xiaofang, but last year it started to feel a bit flat. After Xiaofang had an exhibition in Shanghai last year, many people may have known more about Xiaofang. Last year, she actually made a profit of 800 yuan. If it could recycle itself, there would be no need to raise it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now Xiaofang’s new project is to open Xiaofang Bank in a shopping mall in Nanjing. Xiaofang&#39;s works themselves are extremely public. In addition to the dialogue in exhibitions in art museums and galleries, what feedback and possibilities it has when facing the real public is extremely important to us. Because the crowds faced by art museums and galleries are actually screened, but in shopping malls they face the real public and reality, without the protection of an incubator. The concept of this bank is that I hope that the banks of the future will be made of wool, I hope that the currency of the future will also be made of wool, and I hope that the weapons of the future will also be made of wool. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before the 1990s, the entire society was lacking in materials, and wool, as a craft of aunts, could make people The family was fed and clothed, and now the value of the wool had changed. Why are there so many people knitting now? When I held an exhibition in Shanghai last year, some people told me that they would do a lot of knitting during the epidemic. Small fabrics can actually bring you a lot of surprises and feedback, because handiwork itself has healing properties. What you exchange for time is a thing, which is an exchange of the most primitive labor force. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In Xiaofang&#39;s exhibition, I met a girl who imagined her belly when she was pregnant Knitting shoes and clothes for children. I met a diplomat in China who was making some woolen fabrics during the COVID-19 pandemic. She thought she had made an ugly mouse and an ugly little snake. When this silver-haired lady talked about her fabrics, she was as shy as a little girl. I like these things she made so much. , and can feel the warmth and healing in her heart. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xiaofang’s hat has a lifetime warranty. I don’t want it to break after I buy it back. hole, you just throw it away, which is a pity for manual labor. No matter what projects Xiaofang does in the future, it will always include the function of &quot;filling holes&quot;. We will also open hole-filling to the surrounding communities for free, hoping to form this kind of community. It’s not that we throw something away when it’s a little bit broken. I think we all do too much about abandonment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/riaaGVd4DuZUol0kkbugCr2XbQ9VVw91lGTBWkmH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 510&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/riaaGVd4DuZUol0kkbugCr2XbQ9VVw91lGTBWkmH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255455&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Auntie knitting bikini&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;Surplus labor force in the city, remaining time in the town&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In order to protect my eyesight, most of the wool I gave to my mother was is green. Because green hats don’t have a good connotation in the Chinese context, the aunts still had some doubts when they used green wool to knit various hats. Later, VICE (a new media in the United States) wanted to do an interview for Xiaofang&#39;s art project, and helped find a place to buy cuckolds - St. Patrick&#39;s Day in Ireland. The traditional color of this holiday is green, and ordered a lot of cuckolds for us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In Ireland, these people wear hats to participate in festival gatherings, and the aunties also see those live photos. very happy. The same thing may have completely different meanings in different cultural backgrounds. I also hope to help aunties realize that the world is very rich. But I think it is more important for them to be happy and make free choices. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I returned to my hometown in 2015 and was timid about being close to my hometown. Because I don’t go home very often, I want to know what my mother does on a daily basis. When she placed two large packages of hand-knitted hats in front of me, I realized, oh, she had knitted these two large packages this year and had been purchased by others at a low price. Moreover, the raw materials are too hard on the hands, and the threads are very hard and extremely rough. She doesn&#39;t have the pleasure and happiness of knitting. She just kills time, and this is the only reason left. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I think it’s better to collect it myself, but my mother won’t let me, so I invite friends Help me play the role of &quot;Xiao Fang&quot; of the French company, ask her to make hats, and let her do whatever she wants. In 2015, WeChat was not so popular, and my mother did not have access to WeChat in her hometown. However, because she had to work with &quot;Xiaofang&quot;, WeChat became a work skill that she must master. Because of her work, she learned to surf the Internet and send express delivery. In the past, my father&#39;s name was written on the express delivery because of &quot;Xiaofang&quot;. Later, when she sent express delivery, she always wrote her own name on the express delivery. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/x3FSl3sG3xKOWQPoibqOSdDBEyCe3TBRGPK6EPjf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/x3FSl3sG3xKOWQPoibqOSdDBEyCe3TBRGPK6EPjf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255433&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Xiaofang Universe Bank&quot; Nanjing exhibition scene&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In fact, we have conducted research on the aunts who participated in the Xiaofang project. Almost all of them are eliminated urban surplus laborers. Women who work in cities are easily eliminated after the age of 55. Work as a delivery person or cleaner in the city. After a certain age, even if you are a nanny with many years of experience, it may be extremely difficult to find a job in a big city after the age of 55. This is the problem faced by these aunts in the process of urbanization. It is very common in the town for aunts who are almost in their fifties to return to their hometowns because they cannot find jobs. They take care of their children. Those with better financial conditions open small shops and knit with wool to earn pocket money in their free time. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since the appearance of &quot;Xiao Fang&quot;, the aunts have stopped knitting things for other places. In fact, the aunts all have their own jobs and things. Some aunts will definitely not be able to take care of making our things when the farming is busy. They only plant rice and harvest several times a year, with long idle time in between. Some aunts take care of their children at home. After school is free time. There are also some aunts who have their own small shops. When there is no business, she can do Xiaofang&#39;s business. Xiaofang actually fills up the remaining time of the aunts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In Xiaofang&#39;s third stage &quot;Security&quot;, the aunt at the pork shop first imagined Not sure what to knit. We would guide her step by step. When she was at her busiest, Xiaofang called her and said, &quot;If someone were to rob your pork shop at this moment, what kind of weapons would you use to protect yourself and yourself?&quot; Benefits?&quot; She was holding a large intestine in her hand and said that if he tried to rob me, I would throw the intestine to him. This is a very direct reaction. When she is not busy, we will repeat her own words to her and encourage her to knit this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;About Xiaofang, everyone is discussing the aunt&#39;s imagination, which is actually the artist&#39;s imagination supporting their work. Aunts are a group without imagination, but they can be guided. All they have to do is face their true selves and their own lives. I actually know what they are doing every time, but I am still surprised when I see what comes out. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the beginning, Xiaofang sent me those hat packages made by my mother on weekends. I was very surprised every time I opened the package. This kind of surprise has never happened again. As I was very familiar with my mother, I suddenly discovered that she had a skill that I didn&#39;t know about. I knew that she had always been making hats, but I didn&#39;t know her. It was all fancy and messy and made so many fun things. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The aunts still don’t know what’s going on behind Xiaofang. In fact, it’s not that clear whether they know or not. It&#39;s important because they don&#39;t care about it that much, but I don&#39;t want my mother to know. Some time ago, my mother went to Beijing and stayed for nearly two months. We emptied the entire studio of fabrics, leaving not a single yarn. My mother couldn&#39;t stay after playing for a week, so I asked &quot;Xiao Fang&quot; to come to the studio to give her some work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Actually, on my mother&#39;s side, I haven&#39;t given her too many themes. What I collected is not Representational fabrics, or requiring her to use her brain, did not require her to do so. I wish to collect a period of my mother&#39;s life. I want her to be more free and not want her daughter&#39;s business to become her business, which would be too tiring for her. It&#39;s good for her to live for herself. At this age, she should live for herself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/moyQ2yFfHGz3h68l0on1SaaOqBZ7o6kpFHIpGGfV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/moyQ2yFfHGz3h68l0on1SaaOqBZ7o6kpFHIpGGfV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255442&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Xiaofang Universe Bank&quot; Nanjing exhibition scene&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;Frozen time, undulating waves&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the 1990s, my mother and the aunts in the town were Work in the town&#39;s silk-cutting factory. But China&#39;s textile industry also underwent a major reshuffle in the 1990s. At that time, a large number of laid-off workers were formed, including my mother and aunts. Silk cutting means that after the cocoons are cooked in a high-temperature machine, the silk is separated one by one, and the eight silks are wound into a thread. The finished silk is finally shipped to other places. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The machines in the factory are always rotating at a constant speed, and people are changing. My mother is on this assembly line. Go to work. My childhood was spent sitting on the big machine in that factory. The aunts would change jobs. One would feed me a bite when eating, and the other would feed me a bite when eating. My entire childhood to elementary school was spent in that atmosphere. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;That kind of familiarity between people and people is very good, and it is a very important memory for me , later Xiaofang had so many aunts involved, and I felt the familiar intimacy that I felt at that time. When I was a child, my mother’s workplace would give out various benefits, such as a thermos cup and some washing powder. I think this is very good and will make family members have a sense of recognition for her work. We keep this in Xiaofang. got this. In the past few years, we have distributed almost everything to aunties, from cups to fruits, washing powder, pots and pans to all small household appliances. Recently, because winter is coming, we have I bought a lot of quilts for my aunt, and now I don’t know what to give them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I held Xiaofang’s exhibition at Arrow Factory Space for the first time, my friend advised me to “see you soon.” Just take it.&quot; This suggestion is very sincere. As a friend, I advise me to stop the loss in time. But to me, this is not a work. To me, Xiaofang is a very real life scene between me and my mother, so it is not something that I can just accept, even though I know it will lose money. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/cLjTtqDH1TivdZIMNvYJXlVO1BGvhJyPtLxcRTBm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/cLjTtqDH1TivdZIMNvYJXlVO1BGvhJyPtLxcRTBm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255436&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Xiaofang Universe Bank&quot; Nanjing exhibition scene&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the beginning, we all knitted them casually, and I worked hard to collect them. Later I found out that this was wrong. No matter how big a warehouse I rented, it wouldn’t be enough for these dozens of aunts to weave. If they make it, you have to pay. After paying, you have to help them sell the fabrics. Selling requires talent, and I don’t have it. With this talent, how many hats can several art museums sell? This is so cruel. We mainly work in the studio and rarely understand the operating rules of this world economy. In the process of Xiaofang, it was also interesting that we participated in this kind of work very realistically. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xiaofang&#39;s work is still a very important part of my life. Because actually, for an artist, ten years can produce a lot of works. But Xiaofang and I have a growing relationship together. Xiaofang is implanted into my aunt&#39;s life, and at the same time, she is implanted into my mother&#39;s life and my life. I have also calculated an account. For example, if I make other things, I will also pay the money to the factory and the production unit. But when I pay the aunt, it does not actually form an internal cycle of the art system. Investing this part of the expenses on my aunt, I think, is investing on my own people, which makes me happier. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Next month we will go to Mexico to set up an exhibition. Xiaofang has achieved so far, and there are so many reactions from the audience. Some people like it, and some don&#39;t. I&#39;ve used that metaphor from the beginning to now, I&#39;m a toothpick and I&#39;m also an observer. The aunties are jellyfish. I poked the jellyfish with a toothpick, and the jellyfish swayed in different postures in the sea. Whether it is criticism, praise, interviews or exhibitions, they are all part of the butterfly effect in the sea. My job is to watch these reactions and their postures after taking the plunge. Regardless of the posture of the jellyfish or the waves and waves produced in the sea, in my opinion, it is an extremely beautiful thing because it reacts. , rather than something inherently conservative. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the future, I hope that many people will show me her works like the diplomat stationed in China. . I hope everyone will not be shy and face themselves bravely. There is really no ugliness in handmade things, they are all extremely high-quality. I want to redefine wool, I want to redefine Xiaofang’s cultural attributes. I am mainly doing this kind of work now, and I am continuing to advance it. In fact, artists work quietly in the audience most of the time. As for being seen or not being seen, what kind of reactions and discussions are caused are all external matters. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sichuan is a basin. There is a river over there in our town, which is similar to all small towns in China. The same, a very solid group of people, a very solid time. There are only a few people in the town, but the aunts imagine a French company to do such a thing. I think this thing itself is quite cool. There are a group of aunts in that basin who are thinking about things all day long, and then go about their work in a serious manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[违反一事不能二罚？TST庭秘密何以“脱罪”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259519]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/29/CYLszOgZEkf9sfTtZJimAURqgDipmPMe5iWOlRwx.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;449&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /10/29/CYLszOgZEkf9sfTtZJimAURqgDipmPMe5iWOlRwx.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255901&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 2021, Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang attended the event . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(TST Secret official Weibo screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 26, 2023, TST Secret’s headquarters in Shanghai came A group of people, they are agents from Malaysia and Singapore, &quot;We are finally back,&quot; someone announced excitedly on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as early as August 24, &quot;Big Brother&quot; Lin Ruiyang recorded a video announcing that &quot;our case has finally been concluded, and it is a very positive conclusion.&quot; He raised his voice and was a little excited. , &quot;After the case is closed, I believe more people will think that they are such a good company.&quot; He is sorry that everyone has been wronged in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until October 26, the &quot;Legal Weekend&quot; sponsored by the &quot;Legal Daily&quot;, the organ of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, reported that the Shijiazhuang Yuhua District Court had made a civil ruling and announced the unfreezing of 96 properties under their names and 600 million yuan in cash, this news became widely known, and then the video that Lin Ruiyang posted on Xiaohongshu two months ago became a hot search. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the civil ruling obtained by Southern Weekend reporters, these 96 properties are located at No. 28 Jiangyao Road, Pudong New District, Shanghai, the secret headquarters of Jiting. According to public information from the Shanghai Housing Administration, they spent 1.76 billion yuan to purchase it in 2020, which was the fourth anniversary of TST&#39;s establishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Ruiyang was a Taiwanese artist, and later co-founded the micro-business beauty brand TST Ting Mi with his wife Zhang Ting. This brand has been questioned by suspected pyramid schemes in the past. Until April 2021, Shijiazhuang Yuhua The District Market Supervision and Administration Bureau applied to the court to freeze the huge property of a secretly affiliated company of the TST Tribunal on the grounds of suspected pyramid schemes. Only then did the outside world confirm that it was under investigation for suspected pyramid schemes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Right now, from the perspective of the secret side of the TST court, the outcome of the case has vindicated it. So, is it suspected of being a pyramid scheme? Why did the court unfreeze their property? Multiple documents obtained by Southern Weekend reporters provide the answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;There is indeed a pyramid scheme&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Is there a pyramid scheme in TST Court Secret? The answer is yes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An administrative penalty decision from the Baokang County Market Supervision and Administration Bureau of Hubei Province gave a clear answer: &quot;The Baokang County Municipal Supervision Bureau believes that... the bonuses implemented by the parties for red card members The system requires the person being developed to develop other personnel to join, form an upline and downline relationship, and calculate and pay upline remuneration based on the sales performance of the downline, which belongs to the following behaviors in Article 7, Item (3) of the &quot;Prohibition of Pyramid Selling Regulations&quot;, and is MLM behavior&#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person involved here is Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd., the owner of the TST secret brand, and its legal representative is Lin Jirong. This is the real name of &quot;eldest brother&quot; Lin Ruiyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The signing date of this administrative penalty letter is September 3, 2021. That is, as early as two years ago, TST Court Secret had been identified as a pyramid scheme and was punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant national laws and regulations, pyramid schemes are divided into two situations, one is operational pyramid schemes and the other is fraudulent pyramid schemes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Operational pyramid schemes are subject to administrative penalties by the market supervision department in accordance with the &quot;Regulations on Prohibition of MLM.&quot; It is only an illegal act. If there is no penalty of revoking the business license, you can continue to operate after accepting the administrative penalties and making rectifications and compliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fraudulent pyramid schemes are a serious crime, which falls under the criminal law of organizing and leading pyramid schemes and must be prosecuted by the procuratorate. The main difference between the two is whether there are actual business activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This administrative penalty letter shows that the TST Tribunal secretly belongs to a commercial pyramid scheme. The pyramid schemes identified occurred in Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd. from January 1, 2018 to July 2021, and the illegal gains were confiscated. And impose fines and require &quot;correction within a time limit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, you can continue to operate after making changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2022, the TST Tribunal secretly submitted an &quot;Application for Guidance and Evaluation on the Rectification of the Product Sales System of Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd.&quot; to the Baokang County Market Supervision and Administration Bureau. It listed its rectification measures in detail and believed that &quot;the rectified product sales system is completely in line with normal business practices. There is no bonus method based on team salary, and it should not fall within the prohibited situations stipulated in the &quot;Prohibition of Pyramid Selling Regulations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters compared the two bonus systems before and after the rectification, the April 2021 version and the February 2022 version, and found that the biggest difference is that there is no team salary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bonuses are divided into three parts: one is the sales discount bonus, the other is the batch difference bonus, and the third is the self-media education promotion bonus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is the name of the form. It used to be called &quot;Ting Secret Dealer Bonus System-Red Card&quot;, but was later changed to &quot;Ting Live Member Discount Table&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sales discount bonus is mapped to the new table and becomes a &quot;discount&quot;. The difference is not big. This part is a commission for personal performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest change is the discount difference, which is the past &quot;lot-to-retail bonus&quot;. This part is the commission for the team&#39;s performance. For example, the team sold a total of 10,000 yuan, of which 2,000 yuan was sold by the team leader himself. This part is commissioned based on personal performance. The remaining 8,000 yuan must be distributed with subordinates according to a certain proportion. This part is the team salary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new rule after the rectification is that &quot;the difference between the sales discounts corresponding to members and their direct members will be accumulated in the form of points or vouchers on the platform or system. The company will ultimately formulate redemption rules and redeem products within a certain period of time. Or deduct the purchase amount (ranging from 2% to 24%).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;self-media education promotion bonus&quot; that used to be extracted in proportion to the team&#39;s performance has now become a &quot;promotion service fee.&quot; The promotion service fee has added conditions for receiving it, requiring that &quot;the member&#39;s own live broadcast product performance is greater than 0 &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the proportion of promotion service fees calculated based on team performance was between 4% and 5%, but now it is unified at 3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After rectification, Tingmi believes that “Tingmi’s sales performance commissions are only generated for directly related superior members, and they are all one-time rewards and are not passed on.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This rectification report also received a reply from the local regulatory authorities, stating that &quot;our bureau will organize relevant personnel to conduct research in a timely manner.&quot; After that, TST Court Secrets has been operating normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;One thing cannot be punished twice&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because Baokang County, Hubei Province has secretly conducted an investigation into the TST Court on May 25, 2021. This made the Market Supervision Bureau of Yuhua District, Baoding City, Hebei Province, which only opened the case for investigation on June 5, 2021, passive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Administrative Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; has clear provisions, firstly, &quot;prior jurisdiction&quot;, and secondly, &quot;no penalty whatsoever&quot;. At the same time, the &quot;State Administration for Industry and Commerce on Further Improving the Investigation and Punishment of Online MLMs The Notice also clarifies the jurisdiction of online pyramid schemes cases, and the competent authority shall apply the principle of full jurisdiction over the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, who has jurisdiction is the first issue that the two market regulatory authorities must resolve. Judging from subsequent developments, Baokang County, Hubei Province did not give up its jurisdiction and imposed penalties four months after the case was filed. The secret rectification of the TST Tribunal was also completed in February 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What really attracted widespread attention to this case was that on December 23, 2021, the Shijiazhuang Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau announced in a reply to an inquiry letter that “because of its use of financial institutions to transfer or conceal the relevant To transfer the funds, our bureau has applied to the People’s Court to take preservation measures in accordance with the law.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, this application was supported by the Yuhua District Court, which froze 96 properties and 600 million yuan in cash secretly owned by the TST Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This court ruling freezing property has been questioned by the industry. Yang Fan, the attorney representing the case, said on social media, &quot;How can the Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau&#39;s application for court preservation be a civil ruling? The Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau has not made any administrative decision in the past year. How can it be in the administrative agency? Are you going to apply for court preservation while the case is being investigated?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Bing, another attorney in the case and professor of administrative law, also publicly questioned on social media, &quot;Is this a civil pre-litigation preservation or a litigation preservation? The first preservation period was only 30 days, and litigation preservation was even more impossible. No one sued at that time or now, and it is impossible for the Market Supervision Bureau to be the plaintiff.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shijiazhuang Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau stated in an interview with Upstream News that it had set up a task force and more than 400 law enforcement officers participated in the investigation. &quot;Currently, it appears to be a commercial pyramid scheme. Whether it has the characteristics of a fraudulent pyramid scheme is still under investigation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until July 26, 2023, the People’s Court of Yuhua District, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province issued a civil ruling: “County and municipal-level industrial and commercial and market supervision departments should investigate and handle online pyramid schemes cases before filing or filing a case. At the same time, it was reported to the provincial industrial and commercial and market supervision departments step by step. Now that the report has been revoked, the conditions for this court to continue to implement preservation measures on the suspected online pyramid schemes assets in this case are no longer met.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An insider involved in this case interpreted this paragraph of text to Southern Weekend reporter. He said, &quot;The word &quot;revoke&quot; is used here instead of withdrawn, which means that the filing may have been revoked by the superior department rather than withdrawn. Yuhua District Municipal Supervision Bureau proactively withdrew the report. After withdrawing the filing, we cannot rule out the possibility that the case will be withdrawn in the future.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of this person familiar with the matter, in accordance with the principle of &quot;nothing is dismissed&quot; in the &quot;Administrative Penalty Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, if the Yuhua District Municipal Supervision Bureau believes that Baokang County has taken effect in the administrative decision If the illegal gains are incorrect, it involves the correction of administrative actions and must be submitted to the competent authority for cancellation in accordance with legal procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the administrative penalty letter of Baokang County gives the secret and true business data of TST Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The penalty letter shows: From January 1, 2018 to July 2021, TST secretly developed a total of about 7 million members, including about 6.41 million blue card members and about 650,000 red card members. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main business income of the illegal red card is approximately 9.17 billion yuan, the main business cost is approximately 5.64 billion yuan, the main business taxes and surcharges are approximately 37.44 million yuan, and the actual related expenses incurred are approximately 3.458 billion yuan. billion, income tax expenses were 10.46 million yuan, and profits were approximately 19.27 million yuan. The profits of Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd. should be considered illegal gains. The final penalty was the confiscation of illegal gains of 19.27 million yuan and a fine of 1.7 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time Shanghai Dalwei Trading Co., Ltd. was on the top 100 companies in Qingpu District, Shanghai was in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2021, due to the leakage of relevant replies from the Shijiazhuang Yuhua District Market Supervision Bureau, both Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang were banned on Weibo because of their involvement in pyramid schemes. As of May 26, 2022, Zhang The court&#39;s Weibo was updated again, stating that &quot;Dalway Company encountered legal disputes and sought legal protection, which fully proves that Dalwe Company respects and believes in the legal environment of the motherland.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[奥纳·泰德斯：从朋克主唱到新晋画家]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258996]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/M5PEK9Zqmrdwlpq3WJEolkTcZ4PVGsv33dwOWYW8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;635&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/M5PEK9Zqmrdwlpq3WJEolkTcZ4PVGsv 33dwOWYW8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254479&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (artist and Taylor Gallery Gia Coppola/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming a painter, Honor Titus was the lead singer of a punk band; before becoming the lead singer of a punk band, he was a writer Also a poet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This path may be reversed and said again: because Ona Titus is a writer and poet, and his friend asked him: Hey, you write poetry anyway, why don’t you just write lyrics for us? ? As a result, he became a member of the punk band Cerebral Ballzy. Then, as the band became an instant hit, well-known artist Raymond Pettibon became a fan and designed the cover of one of their albums. Raymond asked Ona: Hey, I like your song, why don&#39;t you come to my studio and help? So Ona became Raymond&#39;s assistant. After familiarizing himself with all the operations of the art studio, he picked up the paintbrush himself and once again became an instant hit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/wRIs9h63HVnEDSnKteQlhyBXor9w2yLe8a6Xcn2O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/wRIs9h63HVnEDSnKteQlhyBXor9w2yLe8a6Xcn2O.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254467&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Ona Titus: Viewing Distance&quot; exhibition view, 2023, Longlati Jingwei Art Center, Shanghai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Longlati Jingwei Art Center/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Asia is Exciting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;No matter which order you listen to this story, Ona is undoubtedly an enviable lucky person. Almost as soon as he painted his first decent work, he was spotted by Taylor Gallery and brought to New York to exhibit. His paintings were hung side by side with the works of the famous Alex Katz. together. The response from the market is also exciting. Although he is just starting out and does not have any transaction records to back him up, more than 20 important collectors have expressed their intention to buy this painting. He also saw similarities in his paintings and Katz&#39;s paintings: bright colors, simple outlines, flat brushstrokes. &quot;Seeing them hang me and Katz together, I realized that people are Understand my creation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is indeed an eye-catching work: a man and a woman are resting in a leisurely manner on the grass covered with petals. The woman has her back to the picture and cannot see clearly. On the face, the man is like a southern yuppie, wearing a suit and a Panama hat, lying on his back. The whole picture is filled with a kind of nostalgic leisure, which is reminiscent of Seurat&#39;s &quot;Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot; and Manet&#39;s &quot; Lunch on the Grass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/gaYOgkQcj7NCl425bcguB0rX24d8cbS2cSBmJoPX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/gaYOgkQcj7NCl425bcguB0rX24d8cbS2cSBmJoPX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254476&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Kimbella&quot;, 2021, oil on canvas, 121.9cmx152.4cm Private collection, image courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I try to write as I go This person, while listening to his song, was frightened by the deafening noise and turned off his headphones three minutes later. I realized that the Ona who painted the painting and the Ona who was the lead singer of the band may be different aspects of the same person. The calmness, alienation, and even classicalness revealed in his paintings are nowhere to be found in his punk music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ona&#39;s recent solo exhibition &quot;Viewing Distance&quot; at Longlati Jingwei Art Center in Shanghai is his first solo exhibition in China. Prior to this, he had just finished an exhibition at Gagosian, and Asia made him particularly excited. “I had a painting at auction two years ago, and it was finally sold for five times the estimate. The collector is from Asia. It makes me feel the acceptance of my works in the East, and I am also curious about how Chinese audiences will evaluate my paintings.&quot; His pictures can&#39;t help but be associated with the atmosphere of Impressionism, which may be due to the two-dimensional attribute - —In this matter, it was Japanese Ukiyo-e that profoundly influenced Impressionism, and Chinese ink painting that profoundly influenced Ukiyo-e—a hidden line of culture that makes it possible to see déjà vu in viewing, and also reminds this kind of viewing distance on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Two noble men&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It was Raymond Pattybone who introduced him to the door of painting. For Ona, the few people who worked in Raymond’s studio were The year was a time of &quot;information explosion&quot; in his life. Raymond is a comprehensive artist. He was born in the United States in 1957. He is compatible with many iconic American cultural elements and is especially good at integrating images and text. Literature, art history, philosophy, religion, politics, business, fashion, sports, and deviant youth subculture are all sources of inspiration for Raymond. This complexity greatly influenced Ona. Raymond never taught him how to draw, but often discussed literature with him. &quot;Raymond had a library, almost a small library. He often pulled out classic novels and talked to me about the stories in them.&quot; William. · Blake, Proust, John Ruskin and Walt Whitman... Literary nature constitutes Raymond&#39;s visual rhetoric and also profoundly influenced Ona. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/8uYgnmSlVfIHSOEOD2IM55hztNR7Kjo48EFaSRTk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;687&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/8uYgnmSlVfIHSOEOD2IM55hztNR7Kjo48EFaSRTk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254469&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;AP&#39;s Joy&quot;, 2022, oil on canvas, 182.9cmx121.9cm Danjuma Collection, image courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also in Redmond The studio provided Ona with access to a large number of painting classics. He found that he was interested in the Nabi School of painting, including Pierre Bonnard. The style that emphasized outline and color and eliminated perspective naturally lowered the technical threshold and gave amateur painters a simple and straightforward stepping stone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another of Ona&#39;s great friends in painting was Henry Tylor, a famous artist who also lived in Los Angeles. Taylor is an expert at depicting characters, lively and productive. &quot;Some media previously described Henry Taylor as my mentor, but he was actually just a close friend of mine.&quot; Henry Taylor held an exhibition for Ona in his studio, which was Ona&#39;s first as an artist. appearance. At that time, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out in the United States. Hundreds of guests crowded into Henry&#39;s studio.

Every minute he spent on the streets of China, he was observing the crowds around him and learning to speak Chinese at every opportunity. He enjoys painting people, including people in motion, people feasting in fine clothes, and people living leisurely and alone. He fixes a certain moment of people in a specific situation, and that moment itself is narrative. When he wanders around art galleries, his eyes are always drawn to paintings about people, such as Hopper or Andy Warhol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from those artists who usually accumulate visual materials and are good at photography or sketching, Ona&#39;s pictures are novel-like. He likes to paint fictitious images in his mind rather than copying real moments in life. His inspiration often comes from music or literature. &quot;I did a painting of Miles Davis riding a horse, purely from my imagination.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/10/18/v1ALTKi3JPH8Ma62koQLTw1QG3Ho1RuykZMp03mD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/10/18/v1ALTKi3JPH8Ma62koQLTw1QG3Ho1RuykZMp03mD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254474&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Summer at Dodger Hall, 2021 , oil on canvas, 152.4cmx182.9cm Collection of Rony &amp;amp; Orly Grushka, image courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Legendary musician Miles Davis is an outstanding conductor and performer in the history of American jazz music family, but later fell into drug addiction and bankruptcy, struggling with difficulties. &quot;Miles grew up in the green countryside of St. Louis.

She previously worked in a radio station for nearly thirty years as an announcer, Host and other jobs, now retired. It is difficult to define the concept of retirement for professional and technical personnel. They usually retire without rest: radio stations build training schools and ask her to teach broadcasting and hosting classes; relevant professional competitions ask her to be a judge and host programs; commercial organizations ask her to dub, Advertising... I used to be busy all day long, as fulfilling as working, and earning more than my pension. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now, I am basically retired, there are fewer and fewer jobs, and the remuneration for labor is getting lower and lower. In the past few years, the remuneration for each service was around 1,000-1,500 yuan, but later it dropped to 500, and then to 200-300 yuan each time. A few days ago, a shopping website asked: Do you want to accept product advertisements worth 20-30 yuan each? She felt exhausted both physically and mentally. This was really pointless. Forget it, she wouldn&#39;t steal the business of young girls and boys. She had a pension after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I watched the recent AI dubbing and was deeply shocked.

What should those young people who have studied broadcasting for more than ten years do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current AI dubbing can achieve (on the algorithm side) intelligent translation and avoid nonsensical low-level errors; (on the audio side) simulate the timbre and voice of the object, and give it the personality characteristics of spoken language; (on the audio side) Video side) Correct the mouth shape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is: Swift and Trump actually spoke in very standard Chinese, while Cai Ming’s skit was performed in English. And the timbre is very similar to their own, and even the Mandarin spoken by Trump can be set to Mandarin with a slight southern accent. Not only can the sound be real, but in terms of video, their mouth shapes are highly consistent with the language they speak. Only by observing very carefully can you find traces of video modification in very few links. Based on the current speed of AI development, perhaps in a year, this weak trace of modification will be difficult to detect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of intelligent translation, Call Annie, an intelligent interactive chat system based on ChatGPT launched by Animato, has been applied to Apple 12 and above platforms. As soon as it was launched, the stock price of Chegg, an American education platform, plummeted by 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Call Annie is not only a chat software, but also a fully AI education system. Currently, it can provide language services in English, French, German, Spanish and other major languages, and its teaching content covers professional knowledge in various disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, programming, and finance. It can be expected that in the next 1-2 years, Call Annie is likely to develop to cover various human languages, including most minor languages ​​​​and even dialects, and the teaching content it can provide will increase exponentially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s even more amazing is: Call Annie does not require class appointments, is currently free, and can chat 24 hours a day. It does not feel tired, irritable, angry, or needs to get off work like human teachers do. It is more patient and has a good attitude. , He also didn’t criticize or reprimand. Even though I had a poor foundation and was mentally retarded, he still took the trouble to teach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under such a powerful AI attack, it is estimated that many language teachers, basic knowledge teaching teachers, translators, and even university teaching assistants... as long as they are non-original research professors, will be in danger of being eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a powerful AI is still evolving day and night. When I fall asleep, it is still learning, iterating, and improving... I don’t know whether I should continue to call it &quot;it&quot; or prepare to change it to &quot;He, she&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The attack of AI and the challenge to existing human work are not imminent, but the &quot;wolf&quot; has already arrived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IBM recently stated that it will suspend recruitment for positions that may be replaced by AI in the next few years, approximately 26,000 jobs. In the next five years, 30% of these positions will be replaced by AI and automation, which will involve the work of nearly 8,000 people. This is just IBM! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;February 2023, &quot;Fortune&quot; survey: 48% of 1,000 companies in the United States are gradually using ChatGPT to replace human employees, which will involve the work and livelihood of tens of thousands of white-collar workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Snyder said: &quot;In the next 10 years, artificial intelligence may increase productivity by 1.5% per year. This may increase the profits of S&amp;P 500 companies by 30% in the next 10 years.&quot; % or more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the United States, but also all walks of life in the country have also been impacted by AI. In April 2023, a large number of original animators at game companies were laid off, and some companies even laid off more than half of their original animators. The labor remuneration for a single painting by a freelancer has dropped from 1,500 yuan to about 200 yuan. We predicted in a previous article that arts and crafts designers would gradually lose their jobs, just over a year ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blue Focus, a well-known domestic advertising company, has completely stopped outsourcing copywriting and switched to AI writing. There is an e-commerce company founder who spent 3 months training GPT to write product copywriting and replaced 7 employees. Some Taobao merchants have used AI-generated digital models instead of real ones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, my sister’s loss of her former professional voice work was not an isolated case, but just a note in the common fate of millions of professional and technical people in the context of this era. The advancement of AI has developed from the field of engineering technology to the visual arts industry, and then expanded to language and performing arts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Lu Qi, the former president of Baidu, said: Now there is a time for swearing every week, because I am so shocked by the technology that I can’t help but swear. Because after the emergence of ChatGPT, AI technology has been developing rapidly in days. Under the impact of the AI ​​wave, no matter whether it is science and engineering, liberal arts, or art, whether it is grassroots production personnel, professional and technical personnel, administrative personnel, or even senior executives, all People can stay out of things. Where will the development of science and technology push mankind in the future? This may have exceeded our current cognitive abilities and thinking framework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
