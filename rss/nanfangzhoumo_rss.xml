He graduated from Renmin University of China and received a doctorate in economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1992, Hu Jinglin has worked in the State-owned Assets Administration Bureau as deputy director of the Policy, Regulations and Judicial Regulations Division. According to the &quot;Historical Dictionary Series of the Communist Party of China&quot;, in order to straighten out the relationship between state-owned assets and establish and improve the state-owned assets management system in the process of reform and opening up, in November 1988, the state established the State-owned Assets Administration Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the Chinese Government website, in 1994, the State-owned Assets Administration became a national bureau (deputy ministerial level) managed by the Ministry of Finance. Its main task is to comprehensively manage state-owned assets within and outside the People&#39;s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1998, the State-owned Assets Administration Bureau was officially abolished. In the same year, the Large Enterprise Working Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was formally established. During this period, the management structure of state-owned enterprises changed several times until the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council was established in 2003. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the time of organizational reform in 1998, Hu Jinglin entered the Property Appraisal Department of the Ministry of Finance, and then served as Director of the Economic Construction Department of the Ministry of Finance, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Finance, and Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the official website of the State Council Information Office, Hu Jinglin has long been engaged in state-owned enterprise reform and macroeconomic theoretical research and practical work. He has rich work experience and profound theoretical foundation. He has participated in a number of major reforms of financial and industrial management systems and He is engaged in research on important macroeconomic policies and has authored (translated) many works such as &quot;State-owned Enterprise Reform and Approaches&quot;, &quot;Financial Asset Assessment&quot;, and &quot;U.S. Federal Government Budget&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Hu Jinglin served as Assistant Minister of Finance and member of the Party Leadership Group. Five years later, he was promoted to deputy minister of finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to The Paper, when he was promoted to Vice Minister of Finance, Hu Jinglin was in charge of the General Office, Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Comprehensive Development Office, Bureau of Retired Cadres, Information Network Center, and China Finance and Taxation Museum, assisting then Minister of Finance Lou Jiwei is in charge of the Office of the State Council’s Comprehensive Rural Reform Working Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure at the Ministry of Finance, Hu Jinglin repeatedly emphasized the importance of budget management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Hu Jinglin emphasized at the National Financial, Administrative, Political and Legal Work Conference that as far as the budget is concerned, it is necessary to enhance the legality and binding force of the budget and how to solve the problems of inaccurate budget preparation at the beginning of the year and mid-year budget. To deal with the problems of frequent adjustments and excessive budget balances at the end of the year, &quot;we need to work with departments to establish the concept of &#39;budget is law&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Never let the medical insurance fund become &#39;Tang Monk Meat&#39;&quot;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;After four years as Deputy Minister of Finance, Hu Jinglin was transferred to the National Medical Security Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2018, the First Session of the 13th National People&#39;s Congress voted to adopt a decision on the institutional reform plan of the State Council, establishing the National Medical Security Administration of the People&#39;s Republic of China (deputy ministerial level) and becoming an agency directly under the State Council. Hu Jinglin became the first director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The institutional reform plan of the State Council at that time proposed that the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security’s basic medical insurance and maternity insurance responsibilities for urban employees and urban residents, the National Health and Family Planning Commission’s new rural cooperative medical responsibilities, and the national The National Development and Reform Commission&#39;s drug and medical service price management responsibilities and the Ministry of Civil Affairs&#39; medical assistance responsibilities were integrated to form the National Medical Security Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, during his tenure, Hu Jinglin actively promoted the solution of problems such as difficulty and high cost of medication for ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2019, during the National Two Sessions, Hu Jinglin said in an interview at the &quot;Ministerial Channel&quot; that more life-saving and emergency medicines should be included in medical insurance by optimizing the directory structure to further alleviate and alleviate the epidemic. It is difficult for the people to use medicine and it is expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the State Council Information Office press conference in May 2023, Hu Jinglin introduced that in the past five years, the National Medical Insurance Administration has accelerated the pace of medical insurance negotiations and promoted a large number of exclusive drugs such as camrelizumab and nosinaxin sodium. A variety of anti-cancer drugs and drugs for rare diseases are included in medical insurance at appropriate prices, and after reimbursement, the cumulative burden on patients has been reduced by more than 500 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the official website of the National Medical Insurance Administration published an article written by Hu Jinglin, stating that the next step is to strengthen the management of medical insurance funds, continue to carry out in-depth special operations against fraudulent insurance, and &quot;look back&quot; on some provinces Conduct random inspections and reviews of work. In addition, give full play to the power of the reporting reward system and establish a reporting clue supervision and feedback mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Make good use of the agreement management system. Medical institutions whose agreements have been terminated shall not be included in the medical insurance designated areas within 3 years. Build a long-term mechanism for fund supervision and &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Never let the medical insurance fund Become the new &#39;Tang Monk Meat&#39;&lt;/span>;.&quot; Hu Jinglin introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the above-mentioned press conference of the State Council Information Office, Hu Jinglin said that medical insurance funds are &quot;life-saving money&quot; for the people. The National Medical Insurance Administration has always regarded strengthening the supervision of medical insurance funds and maintaining fund security as its top priority, and severely cracked down on various forms of fraud. Such illegal use of medical insurance funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past five years, the total annual revenue of the basic medical insurance fund (including maternity insurance) has increased from 2.14 trillion yuan to 3.09 trillion yuan, and the total annual expenditure has increased from 1.78 trillion yuan to 2.46 trillion yuan. The fund is running smoothly and has a balance,&quot; Hu Jinglin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Wang Jun has been the director of the State Administration of Taxation for ten years&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Chinese government website shows that Wang Jun, the current director of the State Administration of Taxation, was born in 1958. He graduated from Peking University and received a doctorate in law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jun served in the Ministry of Finance from 1987 to 2013. In March 2013, Wang Jun, then deputy secretary of the Party Leadership Group and deputy minister of the Ministry of Finance, was promoted to secretary of the Party Leadership Group and director of the State Administration of Taxation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2023, Wang Jun, Director of the State Administration of Taxation, held talks with the Director of the Qatar General Administration of Taxation.

Image source: The official website of the State Administration of Taxation&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 1993, the State Council issued a document stating that in order to adapt to the national tax work, the organizational specifications of the State Administration of Taxation would be adjusted from the deputy ministerial level to the ministerial level. In January 1994, China began to implement the reform of the fiscal and taxation system with the tax-sharing system as the core, which significantly increased the central fiscal revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the reform of the tax-sharing system, the State Administration of Taxation has successively had five directors, namely Liu Zhongli, Jin Renqing, Xie Xuren, Xiao Jie, and Wang Jun. Among them, Wang Jun has served the longest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All five of them have worked in the Ministry of Finance, and four of them have served as Ministers of Finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Zhongli served as Minister of Finance and concurrently Director of the State Administration of Taxation from 1992 to 1998. Jin Renqing, Xie Xuren, and Xiao Jie all served as Ministers of Finance after serving as Directors of the State Administration of Taxation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, Wang Jun has served as the director of the State Administration of Taxation for ten years and is 65 years old. In March 2023, Wang Jun was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at the resumes of Wang Jun and Hu Jinglin, they have worked together in the Ministry of Finance for more than ten years, and both have served as director of the General Office of the Ministry of Finance, spokesperson, assistant minister, deputy minister, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the ten years since Wang Jun served as director of the State Administration of Taxation, China&#39;s tax system reform has continued to deepen, including a series of actions such as replacing business tax with VAT, individual tax reform, merging state and local taxes, and tax and fee reductions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from October 2018, the &quot;threshold&quot; for personal income tax will be increased from 3,500 yuan/month to 5,000 yuan/month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Five months later, Wang Jun said at the &quot;Ministerial Channel&quot; of the National Two Sessions that the personal income tax reform will bring 100% tax reduction to the working class, and about 80 million of them will no longer have to pay a tax. Taxes will be reduced by more than 70% for about 65 million people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same year, the First Session of the Thirteenth National People&#39;s Congress passed the institutional reform plan of the State Council. The State Council will reform the national and local tax collection and administration systems, merge the national and local tax agencies at the provincial and sub-provincial levels, and specifically bear the responsibilities of various taxation agencies within its jurisdiction. Responsibilities such as tax and non-tax revenue collection and management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tax-sharing system reform in 1994 established two sets of tax collection and management systems: national tax and local tax. After 24 years of operation, the state and local taxes were merged and a new tax collection and administration system was established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the effects of tax cuts and fee reductions, the 2023 State Council Government Work Report concluded, “In the past five years, a cumulative tax reduction of 5.4 trillion yuan and a fee reduction of 2.8 trillion yuan have been achieved.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[考公考研人数一升一降：替代还是互补，如何读懂两者间的关系？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261528]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 26, 2023, the written test for public subjects of the national examination will begin. The number of applicants for the national examination exceeded 3 million for the first time. A total of 2.613 million candidates confirmed their registration before the examination, and 2.252 million actually took the examination, which is unprecedented. Vertical comparison shows that a total of 1.422 million people actually took the exam last year. From 2020 to 2024, the number of people recruited for the national examination will be approximately 24,100, 25,700, 31,200, 37,100, and 39,600, which is rising steadily, but it is far from meeting everyone&#39;s application needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, this year is the first time in eight years that the number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination has dropped, which may indicate that the enthusiasm for the postgraduate entrance examination has reached its peak. This shows that it is a high probability event that the public and postgraduate entrance examinations will go their separate ways. Because for most people, the purpose of taking the postgraduate entrance examination is to delay employment and postpone the employment decision for two to three years, in the hope that a graduate degree will give them a certain competitive advantage. However, on the one hand, the employment situation is becoming increasingly difficult. Today’s undergraduate degree vs. For graduate students after two or three years, the latter may not have a significant advantage in finding a job. On the other hand, the opportunity cost of obtaining a graduate degree is getting higher and higher. Changing from a master&#39;s degree to a professional master&#39;s degree means higher tuition expenses. The public examination is different. If you use the time and money to take the postgraduate entrance examination and graduate school, you can take the public examination in multiple places in a year. Until you pass the examination, the probability of &quot;getting on board&quot; will be higher. The two go off and on, and it is obvious that more and more people believe that taking the public examination directly is more cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the relationship between the postgraduate entrance examination and the public examination is complex. In addition to substitution, there is also a complementary relationship. For example, some people still want to take the civil service exam after taking the postgraduate entrance examination. This is because there are more civil servant positions that they can apply for with a postgraduate degree. Educational qualifications become higher and more attractive, and there is also an additional channel for selecting students to enter politics. In short, you can expand your options for public examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the recruitment requirements for national examination positions, the threshold for academic qualifications is constantly rising. This year’s national examination recruitment requirements are all for a college degree or above. As the number of recruits increases year after year, the number of positions that require a college degree as a starting point is decreasing year by year. This year, there are 56 positions that college students can apply for, a decrease of 106 year-on-year. At the same time, the number of positions requiring a master&#39;s degree and the planned number of people have increased significantly. According to statistics from China Youth Daily, there are 2,046 positions requiring a master&#39;s degree or above this year, an increase of 814 year-on-year; there are 24 positions requiring a doctoral degree, an increase of 14 year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to explain this phenomenon? A common view is that the demand for highly educated talents in government agencies has increased. This actually amounts to no explanation. Are these positions really only available to those with a master&#39;s degree or above? Probably not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current employment environment, the attractiveness of jobs within the system has been further enhanced: there is a &quot;establishment&quot;, decent salary, complete benefits, high social status, and stable work. As long as you don&#39;t make big principled mistakes, you will not be unemployed. The danger. Therefore, competition for these positions will continue to intensify. The ratio of the number of people admitted to the national examination to the number of people taking the examination was 1:38 last year and 1:57 this year. The ratio of popular positions is even more exaggerated. When competition intensifies, one of the main criteria for selecting talents will naturally be academic qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For employers within the system, when they are recruiting someone, why not choose someone with a higher academic qualification and a better school? Based on purely objective indicators, this is equivalent to obtaining &quot;better talents&quot; with the same staffing and cost, and neither leaders nor the public can find fault. On the contrary, if you do not recruit people with higher academic qualifications and better schools, but recruit people with average academic qualifications, you will most likely need to explain to the public why it is not a &quot;carrot recruitment&quot; and the people you recruit are the most suitable for the position. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this logic and mentality, it is not difficult to understand the following phenomena that are hotly debated by the public: Peking University’s Ph.D. in nuclear physics obtained the urban management establishment, Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s M.D. became a middle school doctor, and Harvard University’s master’s degree applied for education Non-career positions in the Overseas Study Service Center of the Ministry of Education. It is not difficult to understand why the academic qualifications threshold for recruitment within the system continues to increase: last year, we required a bachelor&#39;s degree, but we recruited several master&#39;s degrees from prestigious universities; this year, we simply require all master&#39;s degrees, and people are willing to come and don&#39;t have to spend more money, so why not? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed, this is very different from the recruitment logic of free competition industries. Except for the R&amp;D departments of some leading companies, generally the company&#39;s academic qualifications are only a reference when recruiting people. The key is to see whether personal ability and character match the company&#39;s job requirements. If you have too high academic qualifications, you will have the problem of over-qualification. For the same position, undergraduates may do better than those with master&#39;s or doctorate degrees, because from the perspective of the company, everyone must receive vocational training anyway. Being young is an advantage, the mind is not yet rigid, the person has the courage to try and accept new things, and can get started quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, some undergraduates complained that they could not get offers (invitations) when applying for jobs as undergraduates, but they got many offers by pretending to be high school students. The reason why high school students are required rather than &quot;high-achieving students&quot; is because in the eyes of the company, high school students are enough to complete the job. All they need to do is behave in a disciplined manner, follow the procedures honestly, and listen to instructions. They hope that employees can calm down and maintain stable work. ; If you are looking for undergraduates, they may think that they are overqualified and are just making do for the time being, or they may be riding a donkey looking for a horse, and they are not willing to work without peace of mind. Why bother asking for trouble because of a false reputation? After a while, the &quot;top students&quot; leave, and new people have to be recruited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, after understanding the difference in recruitment logic and mentality between the system and the free competition industry, students can decide whether they need to go to graduate school, whether to take the public examination as an undergraduate to get a job, or to go to graduate school to make themselves available. Wider choices. These are factual judgments, not value judgments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, in the long run, encouraging the best students to engage in innovation, create wealth in free competition industries, and create a good institutional environment and motivation mechanism for them will naturally be a blessing to society and a country. blessing. For some time, the government has introduced many measures to stimulate the development of the private economy. Recently, eight departments have introduced &quot;25 specific measures to support the private economy.&quot; This effort is in the right direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[雷军向母校武大捐13亿背后：曾领两千奖学金立志万倍还回来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261522]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 29, Wuhan University celebrated its 130th anniversary.

This donation mainly focuses on three directions: supporting research in the six basic disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, literature, history and philosophy, supporting scientific and technological innovation in the computer field, and supporting the training of college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lei Jun recalled that more than 30 years ago, as an outstanding student representative, he was awarded the highest scholarship at Wuhan University at that time, which was a full two thousand yuan, sponsored by a company. He said that for a student from an ordinary county family, this is really a huge sum of money. To this day, he still clearly remembers the excitement and pride he felt at that time. At that time, Lei Jun secretly swore in his heart, &quot;No matter how much scholarship I receive today, I will pay it back ten times, a hundred times, or ten thousand times in the future.&quot; In 1997, six years after graduation, Lei Jun started donating to his alma mater. At that time, his salary Only 4,000 yuan. He began his journey to fulfill his vow and donated money to establish the &quot;Lei Jun Scholarship&quot; (then called the &quot;Tengfei Scholarship&quot;) at the School of Computer Science. He has continued to donate for 26 years now. Lei Jun lamented that today he has finally fulfilled his wish to repay 10,000 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 29th, Lei Jun posted on Weibo to congratulate his alma mater on his birthday: Today is the 130th anniversary of Wuhan University.

To be honest, the risk will be relatively high.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuerong, Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of Guiyang Big Data Bureau, further explained to Southern Weekend reporters that due to the influence of negative public opinion on the Internet, superior supervision Out of the principle of prudent supervision, the department does not agree to the online launch of Yijingjie database for the time being. &quot;As long as the regulatory authorities relent, it can be launched in any minute.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Delayed launch&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The biggest doubt from the outside world is whether Yi Wingjie, which started with distributed databases, can build a more technically difficult bank core transaction system database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The databases currently used in the financial industry are still mainly centralized, but distributed is the general trend and has computing advantages under massive data and high concurrency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The branch president of a state-owned commercial bank told Southern Weekend reporters that the difficulty in developing the bank&#39;s core transaction system database lies in the large amount of data that needs to be stored for many years and ensure that the system does not go down. In addition, each bank needs to do some customized development according to the needs of customers. For example, it has to open separate interfaces with the credit reporting system and tax system of the People&#39;s Bank of China, which &quot;has strict requirements for security.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three years since Guiyang Bank purchased the Yijingjie database, it has not been able to go online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Wingjie was originally relatively optimistic about the launch time. According to the company&#39;s internal documents, the construction goals are divided into three stages:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the end of June 2020, achieve an average success rate of 99.999%, and successfully implement the &quot;dual database parallel&quot; plan for Guiyang Bank&#39;s core business system in 2021. The main database uses the domestic Yijingjie database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the end of September 2021, the Yijingjie database for typical applications such as banking financial core, graphical front-end, process banking, and credit systems will be transformed and put online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third phase will comprehensively plan and transform the information system of Guiyang Bank, and realize the localization transformation of the full-scenario application system by the end of July 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information can also be seen that the launch time of Yijingjie database has been delayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2021, the evaluation report of Yijingjie’s shareholder China Software (600536.SH) showed that the core transaction main database purchased by Guiyang Bank is planned to be officially launched in the first half of 2022. Apparently it didn&#39;t happen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was already two years later, in May 2023, that there was any further news. When accepting a survey from investors, the Bank of Guiyang stated that the Yijingjie domestic database application project has entered the testing phase and is advancing various testing tasks in an orderly manner. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, another investor asked about the progress of Yijingjie’s domestic database at the Bank of Guiyang’s third quarter performance briefing. Chairman Zhang Zhenghai replied, “The development of the new core business system of Bank of Guiyang has been completed. Testing work, the system has entered the online preparation stage, and the system is expected to be online from 17:00 on November 3, 2023 to 8:00 on November 6.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until November 6, Guiyang Bank issued an announcement stating that &quot;the new system has been successfully launched&quot;, but did not declare what database it adopted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the current status of Yijingjie as a backup follower library, He Xin explained that for relatively mature bank core trading systems, it usually takes 18-24 months from research and development to launch. However, the Guiyang Bank project has many innovations, such as the full-stack core business system and the first application of eCas4.0 in the banking industry, so it takes a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also added that as early as the beginning of 2021, Guiyang Bank signed a contract with Oracle to allow Oracle and Yijingjie to run parallel databases to back up each other, creating a relatively safe structure. The performance of Yijingjie database is acceptable, but the database does not only rely on performance. &quot;If it is actually put online, we would like to test it more.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yijingjie is located on the 24th floor of Tower C, No. 1 Gaoke.

The development of the big data industry is considered by Guizhou as an excellent opportunity to change lanes and overtake. In 2015, the country established the country&#39;s first comprehensive big data pilot zone in Guizhou. One of its important tasks is to solve the security and independent controllability issues of China&#39;s big data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Yi Jingjie, he has never had access to the core transaction system database of a bank before, so he faces great technical challenges. Similarly, for the Guiyang Municipal Government and Guiyang Bank, betting on Yijingjie is also a risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Guiyang State-owned Assets Representative who participated in the investment in Yijingjie revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that at the end of 2015, Guiyang State-owned Assets learned about Yijingjie and visited Yijingjie’s technical team, launching a long-term Half a year of due diligence, interviews included Tencent Music (NYSE: TME), the three major telecom operators, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before investing in Yijingjie, Yijingjie signed an agreement with Guiyang State-owned Assets, stipulating that Guizhou Yijingjie would be the headquarters, and Shanghai Yijingjie and American Yijingjie would be the subsidiaries of Guizhou Yijingjie. &quot;When we invested, we promised to invest 20 million yuan first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person familiar with the Guiyang government revealed to a Southern Weekend reporter that although Yi Jingjie is not well-known, it does distributed databases , the leaders at the time also saw it, the technology was relatively new. &quot;The problem with it is that no one uses it, and there is no actual application scenario verification.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuerong said frankly that Guiyang&#39;s big data started slowly, but it can attract a database company and regard it as a treasure, or even treat it as a treasure. Unicorns to breed. &quot;No city in the country dares to do this. We take real application scenarios and let them verify the database.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016-2019, Guiyang Industrial and Information Industry Development Guidance Fund Co., Ltd. , Guiyang Service Outsourcing and Call Industry Venture Capital Fund Co., Ltd., Guizhou Provincial Venture Investment Promotion Center, Guiyang Comprehensive Bonded Zone Development Investment (Group) Co., Ltd., Gui&#39;an New Area Emerging Industry Development Fund (Co., Ltd.) and other state-owned industrial funds , successively became shareholders of Yijingjie by increasing capital, with a cumulative investment of 128 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people from the Guiyang Municipal Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the initial investment and introduction of Yijingjie was based on its overseas technology. According to the official website of Yijingjie, the company is &quot;one of the few domestic database manufacturers with independent core technology.&quot; The R&amp;D team originates from Tianteng Company, with 30 years of technology accumulation and a complete team structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yijingjie was initially chaired by Chinese-American Li Weichong, and Li Jing, as his Chinese wife, served as the legal representative. Li Weichong has a glorious resume. He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and received dual doctorates in finance and computer chemistry. Before founding Yijingjie, Li Weichong served as a senior executive in Lucent, Accenture, HP, China Unicom and other companies. Among them, asking Yao Ming to endorse China Unicom New World has become a classic case of publicity and promotion model, which once caused a sensation in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person close to Li Weichong and his wife described to Southern Weekend reporters that Li Weichong is personable, has extraordinary conversation, and has a gentle personality. Li Jing is on the strong side and has been in the clothing business in her early years. After the establishment of Yijingjie, Li Jing also participated in the daily management of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The original architecture is basically that of a small multinational company.” A former employee of Yijingjie told Southern Weekend reporters that in the early days, Yijingjie was relatively leading in the field of integrated distributed databases, and many people in the team were Colleagues or students of Turing Award winner Jim Gray have a relatively luxurious technical lineup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;American Yijingjie was born first in Guizhou Yijingjie, one was established at the beginning of 2015 and the other at the end of the year. In Li Jing&#39;s own words, he is a &quot;father who has his son first and then looks for him.&quot; &quot;My biggest request for the American team is to pass on the technology of database development to the domestic R&amp;D team. This matter is not a secret among the American team.&quot; Li Jing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yijingjie&#39;s headquarters is located in Guiyang High-tech Zone.

Zhao Jilin/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Small companies take on big projects&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to verify the technical reliability of Yijingjie, the Guiyang government selected Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Behavior as pilot projects, starting with the sandbox project rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called sandbox refers to a virtual database environment used for development, testing and experimental purposes, which is completely isolated from the production environment database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin said that the original core business system of Guiyang Bank was built and launched in 2005, using IBM&#39;s Informix database. Because the system is aging, performance has dropped significantly, and operation and maintenance are worrying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An internal document obtained by Southern Weekend reporters also confirms this. The document mentioned, “In March 2020, the core system mistakenly placed the key synchronization program in the day change process, causing the day to be continuously and incorrectly switched at the end of the day, resulting in a large amount of production data disorder that day. More than a dozen engineers repaired it overnight. It took hours to resolve; a production accident occurred in May 2020, and UnionPay and core logic errors resulted in duplicate entries, resulting in a short payment in the bank.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin further explained that as the customer scale of Guiyang Bank increases, both the database and the application system have obvious deficiencies in business carrying capacity. In addition, in response to the country&#39;s requirements for the development of the credit innovation industry and the self-reliance of the bank&#39;s financial technology system, Guiyang Bank is also making local substitutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Jingjie was keenly aware of this opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a work report to Li Zaiyong, the former vice governor of Guizhou Province, on January 14, 2019, Yi Jingjie said that promoting its database has great strategic significance: &quot;Solving the country&#39;s problems in finance and government affairs , communications and other core fields of information security issues; breakthroughs in the core basic technology of the database will drive the efficiency of the entire industry; replace the international database led by Oracle, which accounts for about 90% of the domestic market, and can be exported to the Belt and Road Initiative and even the European and American markets, from These two perspectives can effectively reduce China&#39;s service trade deficit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zaiyong instructed that from the perspective of institutional support, efforts should be made to build Yijingjie into an innovative platform for the development of Guizhou&#39;s big data industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate on November 21, 2023, Li Zaiyong&#39;s suspected bribery and abuse of power case was concluded by the National Supervisory Commission and transferred to the procuratorial organ for review and prosecution. However, the news did not disclose whether Li Zaiyong&#39;s fall was related to Yi Jingjie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former employee of Yi Jingjie who has worked with Li Weichong and his wife for many years told Southern Weekend reporters that unlike Li Weichong, Li Jing has particularly outstanding planning skills and can grasp the core needs of customers. &quot;She can clearly understand what the Bank of Guiyang, Guiyang Municipal Government and participating manufacturers want, and has a strong ability to make decisions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 2, 2019, the core business of Guiyang Bank&#39;s domestic database construction The sandbox testing system project was sold, with Yijingjie becoming the sole supplier, and the winning bid price was 43.98 million yuan. According to the announcement, this procurement adopts a single-source procurement method because &quot;according to project construction requirements, procurement can only be from a single supplier.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why use single-source bidding? He Xin said that Guiyang Bank&#39;s procurement is based on the &quot;Interim Provisions on the Management of Centralized Procurement of State-owned Financial Enterprises&quot; implemented by the Ministry of Finance on February 5, 2018. &quot;If we violate the law, I think we can be held accountable according to law. If we comply with the law, I think it will be No problem, no further explanation is needed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the project plan, Guiyang Bank uses the Yijingjie database to build a core business sandbox test application system, using the system as a sandbox for the existing core business system, and using the transactions of the core business system on the sandbox Data, carry out the testing and verification work of Yijingjie database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 8 of the same year, Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank purchased another project of Yijingjie - a domestic database application pilot, with a transaction amount of 123 million yuan. This project adopts the &quot;dual database parallel&quot; solution with mutual backup and free switching, and has been officially accepted in May 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A project leader of Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank told Southern Weekend reporters that the dual-bank parallel plan has three stages. In the first stage, Oracle is used as the main database, in the second stage, Yi Jingjie is used as the main library, and in the third stage, Oracle is completely excluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the person in charge admitted that Yi Jingjie has not yet become the main warehouse. “We must first admit the gap, then push our own things up, and let others stand guard for us for a while. , this is a more cautious approach.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An employee structure of Yijingjie obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that Yijingjie was still a start-up company with a small scale when it received the bank order. From 2017 to 2019, the number of employees was 69, 100, and 144 respectively. Among them, there are 46, 74 and 105 technical personnel respectively. There are less than 20 people with master&#39;s degrees in the company, and only one with a doctorate. In addition, Yi Jingjie has a team of more than 30 people in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, according to the evaluation report of the Chinese software shareholders, from June 2017 to June 2021, the total research and development costs of Yibaijie was 62.922 million yuan, of which in 2017, it was 0.03 million in 2018, and only 1.03 million in 2018 was only 1.03 million. In 2019, it was 19.6471 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Most income outsourcing &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On the surface, Yibi Jie has received large orders from Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank in the early stage. But in fact, Yibble did not get much benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person familiar with the matter told the southern weekend reporter that among the 123 million yuan orders signed by Yibi and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, their own products are only 25.9709 million yuan, accounting for 21.11%; Among the contracts signed by 43.98 million yuan, the own product part was only 10.9251 million yuan, accounting for 24.84%. Most of its income is realized through outsourcing, and even partial purchasing income costs inverted, which led the company to a sharp losses in succession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the Asset Evaluation Report issued by Zhongrui Shilian Asset Evaluation Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Zhongrui Shilian) in January 2021, from 2017-2019, Yibi Jie operating income (parent company caliber ) 22.858 million yuan, 15.113 million yuan, and 91.5668 million yuan were respectively; net profit (caliber) was -1.8598 million yuan, 4.016 million yuan, and -493,900 yuan, respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Do n’t make money in the early stage, why does Yibijie develop more difficult banking core trading business system? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A shareholder of Yibi Jie told the Southern Weekend that although Li Jing announced a strong sense of mission to information security, the actual situation was that the company was facing the edge of bankruptcy and had to seek transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From October to November 2019, the Yibble Capital Crisis crisis, the company had no money on the account, and could not even pay the salary for a while. Borrowing funds from Yibi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The above -mentioned shareholders revealed that during the early entrepreneurial period of E -whale, although there were customers such as China Unicom and China Mobile, the amount of single orders was not large, hundreds of thousands to millions. Li Jing once not only mentioned at the internal meeting, &quot;When can I do so?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the United States on the other end of the Pacific, the company&#39;s annual sales revenue is only $ 23 million, but the team&#39;s costs need more than $ 5 million a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, the stance of the husband and wife is inconsistent with the matter of doing the core trading system and database of the bank. Li Weichong opposed many times, and the company&#39;s CEO Ding Hong also resolutely opposed it. &quot;But Li Jing saw the market and insisted on doing it.&quot; The above shareholders said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person close to Li Weiyong told the southern weekend reporter that Li Weichong&#39;s personality is very cautious, and the company’s losses are constantly high. big. On October 7, 2019, Li Weichong and Li Jing agreed to divorce. Li Weiyong stepped down as the chairman and handed all the Yibble Jie who was founded to Li Jing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Aiming at the many issues of Yibi Jie, reporters in the southern weekend contacted Li Weichong many times. He declined the interview with &quot;inconvenience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In December 2019, Li Jing held a meeting in the underground conference room in Beijing&#39;s home. The company&#39;s backbones and representatives of Guiyang have participated in more than 20 people, but they excluded Li Weiyong and Ding Hong representing the American team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A shareholder who participated in the meeting told the Southern Weekend reporter that at this meeting, Li Jing asked the company to make a comprehensive transformation, based on the core business of the bank, and decided to leave the US team. &quot;This is the company&#39;s direction and the place where money is made.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The more you understand the technology, the more you know the border, the more you don&#39;t understand the technology, the more you dare to rush.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person who has participated in Evilist financing told the Southern Weekend reporter that stripping the US team has a lot to do with Anke (safe and reliable). &quot;Later we learned that if you want to do the core business system, you must pass the Anco first. You can&#39;t get this off, don&#39;t do any bank core.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Later The price has achieved a wholly -owned holding of Yibbles in the United States. Then, the US team disbanded and cleared the last obstacle of Yibi Jie&#39;s localization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On October 19, 2020, the Guizhou Sunshine Property Exchange announced that the core business system of Guiyang Bank&#39;s core business system was transaction, with a total price of 426 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He Xin revealed that the project involves the full business chain, from the front, back to core, disaster recovery system, network, monitoring management platform, security and other related projects, involving more than 20 suppliers. Among them, the amount of the Yibble Jie database project was only over 40 million yuan, accounting for over 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Become a &quot;national team&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; For a software startup, sufficient ammunition can maintain this &quot;burning money&quot; game. The method of Yibijie is to marry Chinese software and become the &quot;national team&quot; in the database field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China Software is a large high -tech central enterprise, which is controlled by China Electronics Information Industry Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as China Electronics). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Jing took over the end of 2019, and began to contact China Electronics. In May 2020, China Electronics and Yibai Jie reached an exclusive investment intention, which will complete investment in Yibai Jie through two steps: first to acquire part of the original shares of Li Jing&#39;s Yibi Jie, through Chinese software, and then complete further capital increase Expand shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In April 2021, China officially invested in Yibius, holding 7.6438%of the equity of Yibi Victoria at a consideration of 56.7897 million yuan. One year later, China&#39;s software decided to increase capital. It is intended to adopt a direct investment+newly -held holding sub -enterprise &quot;China Software Investment&quot; investment to register the capital of 22.91 yuan/1 yuan. According to calculations, the actual capital contribution does not exceed 1,819.213 million yuan), and the subscribed by Yi Yibai has added up to 16.9723 million yuan in registered capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the evaluation report of the Sino -Swiss Shilian, the capital increase of China Software to Yibble Jie is nearly 18 times the book value premium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On February 21, 2023, the Chinese Software Board issued an announcement saying that the company had moderate control of actual investment and payment progress in the consideration of prudential and controlling investment risks. As of November 10, 2022, the company had paid 17.91 million yuan in capital increases, and China Software contributed 47.24 million yuan in capital, a total shareholding ratio increased to 11.09%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This investment amount is far from the original plan that &quot;the total contribution does not exceed 389 million yuan, and the total holding of a total of not exceeding the 25%equity of the Yibbles&quot; is far away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On August 17, the Beijing Supervision Bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a warning letter to the Sino -Swiss Period, and proposed that the &quot;business income prediction data basis was not sufficient&quot; for Yibijie. In the first evaluation project, the implementation of the company&#39;s profit prediction data was not fully analyzed and reviewed. The reason for the second evaluation project did not fully pay attention to the reasons for the extension of the extension of the Easy Whale and the extension of the large order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, the warning letter mentioned that &quot;the&quot; first &#39;and other expressions were used in the two evaluation reports, but there was no sufficient evidence to support related expressions in the draft. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since then, Yibi Jie has no big financing trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person who has worked in Yi Whale Jie for many years told the Southern Weekend that the early integrated distributed database of Yibble Jie was relatively leading, but as other companies rose rapidly, the advantages of Yibi Jie&#39;s technical advantages gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually. No longer, there are some problems with the company&#39;s strategy. &quot;In the final analysis, it must be quickly listed, and then pull to resources to expand the R &amp; D team. A world -class technology, relying on small companies of one or two hundred people, how to get a leading position?&quot; Today, the National People&#39;s Congress Jincang, Dameng, Nanda General and Shenzhou GM are known as the &quot;four golden flowers&quot; of domestic databases. Not only are IT giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, but also small entrepreneurial manufacturers for market segments, such as Star Ring and Pingcap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another former employee who was responsible for Easy Whale&#39;s financing pointed out that even if the company wants to go public, it is difficult to meet the standards. The first is that the income does not meet the standard. Another key issue is a single customer. Except for Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, Yibi Jie basically does not have large customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A former employee of Yibi Jie revealed to the south weekend reporter that starting in October, Yi Whale Jie has begun layoffs, because of &quot;financing issues and normal optimization of personnel&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[怀念奶奶丨到此的路程]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261493]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Art history scholar Xu Xiaohu.

He later told me that he &quot;ate the little tiger&#39;s red egg.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;My mother took a boat from Germany, which fell to Nazism, to China to marry Xu Daolin. She found that this ancient country had many traditions that were very difficult for her. At first she refused to kneel and kowtow in front of her grandma like her father did. Growing up in Berlin, Barbara Schuchard had never kowtowed to anyone or any god in her life. In front of many curious viewers, her spine became an unbendable iron bar. At first, the poor father could only run back and forth between mother and wife to explain, and became a master of &quot;diplomacy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The next spring, a huge typhoon hit Nanjing. The young bride went to the Central Hospital to give birth to their first child, and found that the windows of the hospital ward were also covered with debris. Broken by the typhoon. She thought excitedly, ah! This must be a &quot;presidential-level&quot; boy! The father is also waiting for his son, and they have prepared many names - all for boys. When they saw a red and wrinkled little girl, they were completely stunned, indescribable surprise and disappointment. They looked at each other, not knowing what to do. One day passed, two days passed, and I couldn&#39;t think of any girl&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;On the third day, grandma spoke. She explained to the new parents the ins and outs of the baby. Feng Conghu and Yun Conglong, this descendant is obviously my father&#39;s favorite big cat named Xiaohu when he was a child. The cat was suddenly run over by a car one day. The &quot;three bald boys&quot; of the Xu family (my grandfather shaved the heads of all his sons and refused to wear Manchu pigtails) were so sad that they didn&#39;t eat or sleep. They just felt sad. . Grandma comforted Dad and said, don&#39;t cry, Santuer, your little tiger will fly back to you as soon as possible and stay with you for the rest of his life. Dad felt relieved and slowly returned to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Grandma hugged the new little girl and said: Look, isn&#39;t this the little tiger you have been waiting for so many years to come back to accompany you? Who did you say? This is the little tiger who came back. My parents had nothing to say, so my grandma looked at my mother’s face and gave her daughter-in-law a title for the first time——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;You say Isn&#39;t it, Hu Zi Niang? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In the summer of 1934, Xu Xiaohu and his parents were in Guling, Lushan.

Data map&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Eight years later, we spent the most beautiful time in Geleshan, the suburb of Chongqing, the capital of Chongqing, where azaleas bloomed all over the hills and pine trees danced in the wind. time. From 1938 to 1941, my father served as the Charge d’Affaires of the Republic of China in Italy for four years. When World War II broke out and China and Italy broke off diplomatic relations, my parents took my sister Xiaoyu and me back to China. Grandma also came to Geleshan from her aunt&#39;s house in Chengdu to welcome her third son after four years of separation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Our plane landed in Chongqing, and the welcome crowd gathered next to our parents, speaking adult Chinese. I walked down the gangway and stepped onto the land of China. I was extremely moved. This is my motherland! My eight-year-old heart nearly burst. My elementary school classmates in Rome once asked me, Uncle! (This is the pronunciation of Xu Xiaohu by foreigners)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Uncle Stop shouting! Why is your face so flat? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;I thought about it and answered: This is because I come from a very far away and very ancient country. The Chinese Embassy you saw on Viale Pola has strong guards in front of it wearing beautiful uniforms and tall feathered helmets. That is my ancient and luxurious motherland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Now I kneel on the land of my motherland, bend down and lower my head, passionately kiss the place I have dreamed of for four years, I am happy and moved, and shed tears. Tell the motherland softly, great land, the tiger cub is back, your child is back. I will learn Chinese as soon as possible and become a Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The land at that time was so dirty, not as bright and clean as Rome. I saw dirty children with tattered clothes and scabs on their heads, standing there with bare feet and a runny nose, staring at us. Like adults, they spit out phlegm from their mouths and spit it on the ground. Xiaohu was very sad when he returned to China, but he insisted on thinking that this is my favorite motherland, that far, far away, very ancient motherland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After several hours of climbing up the hillside in a sedan chair, we finally arrived at the small, dark mud house at No. 15, Bakuaitian, Geleshan. Someone was carrying the luggage in, and my mother and sister went into the house and rummaged through the luggage for something. I stayed on the balcony and watched my father kneel down next to my grandmother who had her head and feet bound. Mother and son hugged each other, and grandma burst into tears, her thin and high-pitched voice reaching to the sky. Dad cried silently, and they held him and cried like this for a long time. I felt sad after reading it. I didn’t understand a word, but I fully understood the emotion in their hearts. I left quietly, walked into the door, climbed on a chair next to the big round table, and saw a pot of tea and a few unattended cups on the table. Don’t know what that drink is, but it must be a drink from my home country. I just poured myself a drink and watched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Bitter. Adult taste. taste of China. I love it, I want to love it. Have another drink and taste it. Another glass. I have never tasted this taste in my life. A flavor not found in Italy. I am Chinese and I can drink Chinese taste. Cup after cup, I took in this ancient flavor with love and breathed it into my soul. Xu Xiaohu and her motherland gradually became one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;It is starting to get dark. The crying and complaining outside hasn&#39;t stopped yet, but it&#39;s hard to see clearly inside the house. Someone placed a lamp on the big table. It was a green long-handled oil lamp made of ceramics. There was a white wick floating on the bowl of oil, and it was burning with its head exposed on one side, emitting very little light. Is this the only lighting in our entire large room (dining room)? The newly returned Chinese found that she could not see anything, and it was nothing like the light of a Roman electric chandelier. She suddenly felt very ashamed. This is the ancient lighting of my motherland. No matter how bright it is, I will still love it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;I don’t remember how I fell asleep on the first night in Geleshan. I just remember that I insisted on going to school right away, learning my mother tongue again, and becoming a Chinese primary school students. I didn&#39;t expect that I was sent to the first grade to learn how to speak Chinese when I expected to continue studying in the fourth grade of elementary school. I went to school happily. I still remember the first class saying &quot;Come, come, come to school, everyone come to school.&quot; All Chinese characters did not have any phonetic symbols - we went directly to understand the ancient Chinese characters. On the way home, my classmates chased me and threw stones, shouting &quot;foreign woman!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;My hair is not black and straight. It is brown and curved. When I got home, I scrubbed hard with water and a brush, trying to get it straight and black. No matter how wet it is or how you brush it, it will curl up again as soon as it dries. I had no choice but to face these classmates myself, fight with them, and beat them to the ground one by one. After all, I am already eight years old, a little taller than my first grade classmates. Xiaohu, who never behaved negatively when getting along with his Italian classmates, began to release an inner energy and felt very proud. It turns out that the children of the motherland during the war used physical strength to persuade each other. Well, start learning to speak Chinese and start becoming a Chinese hero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Get down from the tree, Hutouer . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;Grandma said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;I will not come down from the tree.

Why do I have to go to grandma&#39;s place? I like living in this tree. Here I can count the enemy planes flying above! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At that time, I already spoke Chinese well. On the pine tree near the dark mud house in Geleshan, I remembered I remembered the free big fig tree that no one had observed or searched for in the large garden of the elegant embassy residence in Rome. My bedroom in Rome had a very high ceiling, and the ceiling to the walls were covered with colorful frescoes of classical mythological characters... There was a two- or three-story dollhouse in the bedroom, and I could play with the furniture inside, a doll&#39;s bed and cabinets, chairs and tables. , and several puppet dolls that can sit and stand. None of this means anything to me. After my nap, I would sneak outside into the garden, find the tallest fig tree, climb up, and hide among its rich leaves that oozed milky white liquid. No one could see me, and no one would come there to find me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;During the fall months I get to pick the juicy fruits from this huge tree. Even if there are no fruits, I can sit on its big branches and enjoy the breeze, the height and the blissful solitude. For a child with a family nanny, this is a rare blessing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;My lovely little sister Xiaoyu is three and a half years younger than me. She has been in the doting arms of a French-Swiss nanny we call Mademoiselle. The Roman years between the ages of 4 and 8 were very free and devoted more to exploring unknown solitude rather than chatting with servants or dolls. In the ever-changing world of trees with cool breezes passing through, I would listen to the sounds of people talking on the ground from a higher vantage point and feel the movements of adults. That perspective allowed me to interact with adults from a wonderful distance. The world is separated by a buffer zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;On those generous branches, everything loses the persuasiveness of &quot;adults say&quot;. From an arboreal perspective, everything happening on the ground becomes less urgent and threatening. Observing them from a higher perspective than adults reveals that adults often undermine the bounds of worldly wisdom or common sense. Surprisingly, they are often like this, spending a lot of time engaging in unnecessary words and deeds; making many unnecessary actions, untrue behaviors, and developing a hypocritical mentality. Adults spend days and nights thinking about issues that may seem unimportant or even ridiculous to us (children). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;For example, they created clothes that were very difficult to put on. My mom&#39;s outfit for going out had a long row of buttons - but they were all in the back! Walking behind her, I could see that one of the buttons wasn&#39;t buttoned correctly, tilting her head to the side, causing all the other buttons to be wrong, creating a funny-looking sight. The adults would pretend not to notice but would giggle behind her back all day long. No one pointed this out to her, and no one helped her rebutton the row of buttons properly. I could only walk behind and look at them, thinking how stupidly and needlessly all this time was being spent, yet we kids were not allowed to point it out, giggle or laugh; Left to themselves and chalked up to adults&#39; love of spending time talking nonsense, children suffer in silence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Grandma tells you to get out of that dirty tree right away Get down from the tree.

I had never heard of embroidery in class! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The thought of sitting in a closed room, holding a thin needle, pricking a piece of cotton stretched in a hoop, in and out Being outside, cutting off all the sounds of the breeze, the fresh air from the sun, the songs of birds, or the voices of people, was to me like cutting off life itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In addition to sitting on the pine tree at home, I also like to sit on a small square stone under another pine tree. On my way home from school, I passed through the valley. At the corner of the winding mountain path, under the big stone mansion of General Chen Cheng, I slid down a few steps to reach that habitat. I sat there for a long time and stared at the distant plains of the Shapingba Valley. , the Jialing River meanders into the distance under the sunshine. There is the Central University there, and my father teaches there and also works for the Chongqing Central Government. In that habitat, I would listen to the voices of the people living in the plains, selling goods, parents shouting at their children, and the children shouting at each other, and I would think of my dad, working alone with his head like me, for all People serve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Every Sunday, he would take the &quot;double rickshaw&quot; to leave our black mud house and go down the thousands of steps to Shapingba below. The riverside plain, entering his Chongqing and his lonely room, I have been thinking like my dad, I think about my dad&#39;s inner world... He is alone, content with everything he can, making our country a better place Some. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;This was at the start of World War II, and Japan was mercilessly bombing Chongqing on a daily basis in hopes of wiping out important government targets. But Chongqing has been in haze, with dark clouds, making it difficult for Japanese aircraft to bomb their targets. Every few days we&#39;d hear sirens whining overhead, and everyone, even those of us on the Gele Mountains, would rush out and squeeze into those dank, dark air-raid caves dripping with condensation. water vapor. Every time I would sneak out alone, sit on the rock under my favorite tall pine tree, count the enemy planes, and try to identify the different brands of the planes based on the black and white photos - those photos were taken from the police station by my classmates and I. Got it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Stop everything now, Hutouer, Come to me immediately. Come and learn embroidery, start today. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why? What good was embroidery when the Japanese were bombing us with planes overhead? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Because you will get married, You have to get ready to be a bride! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;That’s terrible, grandma! Is this really the case? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Of course, fool. Of course you want to get married! Get married and have kids! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Grandma, please tell me, Is our childhood life also about getting married and having children? ——That is such a painful life, grandma! Each of you has given birth to a baby! Mom and Dad have done it too! Grandma’s baby’s baby has been born and is standing in front of Grandma! Now that our group of children has finally arrived, we must start living interesting lives. We are here to live our special, child-only lives! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;I suddenly became crystal clear. The reason we are born is to be born! Become the children of our parents in marriage. Now that we are finally born, our purpose of growing up has been fulfilled and we no longer need to get married and have children! The life Grandma explained was completely unacceptable to my broad, arboreal way of thinking. Is this really the life everyone talks about? So it seems like adults are completely ignorant! The real purpose of life cannot be just for human existence. I saw clearly at that time that humans have obviously not asked this question. The meaning of existence - why we live - this is the question! What did we come to this fun place for? Of course I am here to appreciate this life and play with it thoroughly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Play it to the end - this is what we are here for - isn&#39;t it? This most basic and important test has taken root in my heart since then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Grandma told me many stories. There was a large, round metal barrel on a high shelf in her room. Grandma swayed her little feet back and forth, and was able to walk to the elevated shelf, take down the particularly bright bucket, mix it up, open it, and take out the maltose she made. There is nothing in the world that tastes better than the maltose rolled by grandma herself. They are round and flat, with white powder on the outside to prevent them from sticking together and being difficult to separate. Therefore, eating maltose can certainly be considered one of the main goals of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Listening to grandma telling stories is also one of the wonderful purposes, so charming! Grandma’s stories always include our family’s great heroes. For example, my grandma’s surname is Xia, and the Xia family comes from Yue Fei’s hometown. Grandma&#39;s voice was as sweet as honey and as high as a bird, and the stories she slowly told in her Xuzhou accent were all delicious. Xiaohu sat next to Grandma&#39;s knees and listened, forgetting everything else. The whole village loved Yue Fei, who helped the emperor return from the Jin Kingdom to restore the emperor&#39;s throne. However, Gaozong was unwilling to return the throne he had already occupied to his father. This unfilial son called Yue Fei and Yue Fei&#39;s eldest son. , was convicted as a national enemy and beheaded. The little tiger would burst into tears when he heard this, with tears and snot flying everywhere. The villagers who loved Yue Fei were too sad to speak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Grandma also likes to tell the story of grandpa’s trip to Mongolia——&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Tiger Head, one day, the country wanted the Mongols to stay in China and not be able to leave the motherland and go out independently, so they invited your grandfather to persuade them. So your grandfather, General Xu at that time, ran to Mongolia alone without any troops or weapons, taking only his flute master and the old lady from Xuzhou who made pancakes with him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;In this way, the three of them arrived in Mongolia , found a small hill, went to the top and sat down. Grandpa planted his big &quot;Xu&quot; military flag on the ground and sat there writing lyrics, singing songs, admiring the moon, eating pancakes, and calmly waiting for the Mongolian chief to appear and surrender. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;After a while, the Mongolian chieftain really coming. He looked up and wow! I heard the sound of Kun Opera. I was shocked when I saw the big military flag with the word &quot;Xu&quot; in it. I immediately climbed up respectfully. As soon as I saw my grandfather, I knelt down and kowtowed desperately to apologize. &quot;Oops! The president has come in person. I am so ignorant and incompetent that I dare not take it! I have no intention of disturbing the uncle!&quot; He regretted that it was too late to kowtow and apologize. The confused chief thought that your grandfather was Mr. Xu Shichang, our president at the time, so he surrendered directly. . Hahaha! You see, grandpa brought Mongolia back without saying a word. You say how capable your grandpa is. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;This is how my grandma narrated the story of the three grandfathers taking back Mongolia, and it has become one of our private family history jokes. Now when the great-grandchildren scattered in various countries gather together, they will perform multiple versions of this story as a &quot;historical drama&quot;, showing the story of General Xu Shuzheng&#39;s recovery of Outer Mongolia from various angles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Of course Dad has never heard grandma say this. In front of dad, no one dared to mention grandpa&#39;s name or past events. Dad would shed tears just thinking about his beloved father. Xiaohu actually liked hearing grandma&#39;s story very much, it was much more enjoyable than Yue Fei&#39;s story. I laughed every time I heard the part where the chief was covered in sweat and had no time to kowtow and surrender. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At this time, various ideals of country, struggle, self-sacrifice, integrity, and serving the public took root in my heart. I began to think repeatedly about the purpose of our existence; I felt how important it is and how vast the world of time and space is.

(Chengdu Business Daily/Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 5-day 81st World Science Fiction Convention was held in a city that has not changed its name for more than 2,000 years - —Chengdu&lt;span>;——&lt;/span>; has come to an end. This is the first time that China has held such a science fiction event. In October 2023, more than 20,000 science fiction fans and more than 1,200 guests from 35 countries and regions around the world gathered in Chengdu to talk about the future in this modern city with a long history. Imagine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the conference, 27-year-old science fiction writer Bai Ben stayed in a hotel in Pidu District. On the 19th floor of the hotel, through the window, he saw a shopping mall not far away, which happened to be the one he participated in the design and construction of when he was a real estate company at his former employer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Bai Bi could not describe his feelings for a moment: it was a sense of time and space intertwined in Chengdu, where the past and present, ideals and reality merged. He just came to Chengdu in 2021 and worked as a designer in a real estate company. After 9 months, he was too busy to &lt;span>;home&lt;/span>;; but it was also in Chengdu that he got closer and closer to his science fiction dream, and he successively won several projects in China The Science Fiction Galaxy Award for Best Newcomer and the Chinese Science Fiction Nebula Award for Best Short Story Silver Award. Now, he also has his own book signings at science fiction conventions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As one of the millions of young people &quot;floating in Chengdu&quot;, Bai Bi from Jiangsu has a reason to stay in Chengdu. At present, he is mainly engaged in the Internet industry and works part-time in science fiction writing. There are few cities that can simultaneously host good Internet companies, embrace the vision of building a science fiction industry, and also create a comfortable, livable and smoky urban atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu attracts Bai Ben, and young people like Bai Ben also attract Chengdu. For years, this rapidly rising megacity in the Midwest has struggled to recruit and retain young talents. I don’t know who was the first to say the words, “After Chengdu, there will be no more wandering.” This has become the essence of Chengdu’s talent work branding and the pursuit of the city’s builders. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Beside Xinglong Lake, look up and meet the doctor&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After five years, I faced the computer screen with a picture of Aba, Sichuan Province in 2018 Huang Ying is still quite moved by the high-altitude aerial view of Aerzhai, Wenchuan County, Prefecture. That year, a landslide suddenly hit Aerzhai. Half of the village collapsed &lt;span>; and half of it was buried. Fortunately, no one died. The geological disaster monitoring and early warning platform developed by Sichuan Zhongke Chuanxin Technology Co., Ltd. played a role. Villagers moved in advance and escaped this natural disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying is now the deputy general manager of this company. However, going back to 6 years ago, Huang Ying was still confused on the eve of changing careers. At that time, the 24-year-old was working in a survey and design institute in a province in Central and South China. The industry was gradually declining. A colleague asked: &quot;Should we transform into high technology?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Huang Ying is somewhat tempted, but where to settle is a problem. He thought of Chengdu, where he spent four years in college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, major cities across the country have increased their efforts to attract young talents. Chengdu also needs more young people to participate in urban development and construction. Li Rong, a talent worker in Chengdu, told Southern Weekend reporters that Chengdu has launched version 1.0 of its new talent policy around the idea of ​​“gathering people to prosper the city”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Settlement first and then employment&quot; is a policy initiative that has led to a nationwide trend of settling down and attracting talents. &quot;Those under 45 years old and with a bachelor&#39;s degree or above can directly settle in Chengdu with their graduation certificate.&quot; Li Rong said that in the past six years, Chengdu has attracted more than 710,000 college students to settle down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying took a fancy to the convenience of settling down and joined the trend of &quot;Peacock Flying Southwest&quot;. He and his partners founded a company in Chengdu High-tech Zone, focusing on geological disasters and Environmental disaster prevention and reduction platform construction and product research and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Everything is difficult at the beginning. Huang Ying&#39;s new company encountered obstacles in financing, human resources, sales and other aspects. Initially, he traveled to almost every county in western and southern Sichuan to introduce himself to the local land and resources departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu gave him a hand. Huang Ying remembers that when the company first settled in Chengdu High-tech Zone, the government provided policy support of halving office rents. At the end of 2017, the company sold the first batch of prototypes to a county in western Sichuan. Half a year later, the machine successfully warned of landslides twice, and since then it has gradually opened up the market in southwest China. However, government assistance has not stopped. Three years after the epidemic, the company has also received financial subsidies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying said that currently, the company has applied its equipment and platforms to water conservancy dams, mine safety, foundation pit support, transportation, etc., and has Go nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying’s career is developing, and Chengdu’s talent policy is also iterating. In 2020, Chengdu launched the New Talent Policy Version 2.0 around the construction of the Western Science City, focused on technological innovation, launched and implemented Tianfu Laboratory&#39;s global high-end talent recruitment plan, created Chengdu&#39;s characteristic professional group, and supported high-level platforms to open to the society. In 2022, The Chengdu Innovation Index ranks 29th in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Three years have passed, and there are many scientific research institutions in the Chengdu Science City located in Tianfu New District, Sichuan. Liu Hongyan, a 34-year-old assistant researcher at the Institute of Urban Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, joked, “If you walk around Xinglong Lake, you might just look up and meet a doctor.” In 2019, she came to the institute as a postdoctoral fellow to work on functional Food development and other work, becoming a member of Xinglong Lakeside&#39;s army of doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Shi Jian, the 36-year-old assistant director of the DC Research Institute of Tsinghua Sichuan Energy Internet Research Institute, is also a Ph.D. from Xinglong Lakeside. Looking back on his two years in Chengdu, he felt that he had achieved what he had hoped for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Shi Jian is pursuing the transformation of scientific and technological achievements. He once worked for 7 years in a research institute affiliated to a state-owned enterprise in a southeastern province, focusing on research on ultra-high voltage DC engineering and new energy power generation. He has always been troubled by the fact that the cycle of transferring scientific research to application is too long. After arriving in Tianfu New District, Sichuan, he was able to flex his muscles. Right now, the Shijian team is developing the most critical projects in the power industry such as series of power equipment and power chips for DC projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 22, 2023, Peking University Qiu Deba Gymnasium, the scene of the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; Peking University special event.

State-owned enterprises do not &quot;go round and round to make appointments&quot;. Instead, the person in charge directly reads the resume, interviews, and talks about job content, remuneration and benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a scene from the Beijing special event of the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; series of events. Li Rong introduced that as the most important series of talent recruitment activities in Chengdu in recent years, the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; has held more than 1,000 talent recruitment activities in key cities at home and abroad, and signed more than 200,000 contracts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, Chengdu has focused on leading the city’s talent work with branding strategies. &amp;nbsp;The slogan &quot;Rongpiao&quot; has been shouted out, but there has been some controversy in society as to whether the talent brand should continue to use this name. After all, like Beipiao and Shanghai Piao, there is still the word &quot;piao&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Chengdu has been a typical immigrant city since ancient times, with cultural characteristics of openness, tolerance, generosity and friendliness. According to talent workers in Chengdu, the genetic inheritance and cultural core of &quot;Rongpiao&quot; have long been rooted in the urban development trajectory, and have become Chengdu&#39;s endless driving force, changing the original meaning of &quot;piao&quot; and enriching the meaning of &quot;piao&quot;. &quot;Connotation. Chengdu respects every individual&#39;s dream, cherishes every upward force, and uses the greatest sincerity to help &quot;Rongpiao&quot; realize their personal value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu has fully launched the practice of talent work branding strategy, creating a deeply rooted &quot;Rongpiao&quot; brand, and is also the first country in the country to apply for trademark registration The city&#39;s talent work brand has created a series of flagship products and a series of derivatives, such as the &quot;Rongpiao Plan&quot; to attract talents, the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; to recruit talents, the &quot;Rongpiao Cup&quot; to gather talents, and the &quot;Rongpiao Cup&quot; to educate talents. Talent Development Institute”, Jingcai’s “Rongpiao Talent Day”, Licai’s “Rongcheng Talent Green Card”, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu has been exploring ways to solve practical difficulties for young college students who have just entered society. &quot;Thinking about it from a talent perspective, what does a newly graduated college student lack when going to a city to find a job? It must be a place to live.&quot; Li Rong said that based on this idea, Chengdu has created 26 &quot;Rongpiao&quot; cities in recent years. &quot;Youth Talent Station&quot; provides short-term free accommodation for fresh graduates who come to Chengdu to find jobs, as well as a series of value-added services such as employment guidance and urban integration. &quot;As long as they hold the interview notice and pass the online application, young college students can stay in the apartment for free for up to one month.&quot; So far, more than 80,000 young college students have been accommodated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that in the past, when enterprises and institutions in Chengdu went to first-tier cities and well-known universities to recruit, the results were not good because they worked alone and lacked visibility. not good. Later, they changed their approach and maximized the effectiveness of talent introduction by building a collaborative talent introduction model of &quot;government guidance, employer leadership, and broad social participation&quot; to unify publicity themes, unified promotion processes, and unified logos and slogans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taking this year&#39;s &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; Tsinghua University and Peking University as an example, Chengdu mobilized 26 public institutions and 16 municipal state-owned enterprises to come up with For high-quality positions, university research institutes and Fortune 500 companies are invited to participate in recruitment. According to statistics, this event released 782 recruitment positions and attracted more than 1,800 young college students to participate. The activity includes city promotion, opportunity list release, job promotion, doctoral and postdoctoral policy promotion, etc. Each recruitment unit &quot;can add their own creativity&quot; and set up stalls to recruit talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recruiting young talents is only the first step. In order to retain talents, Chengdu also spent real money. From the city level to the district (city) and county level, there are a series of talent project applications and talent level assessments. Liu Hongyan recalled that after she achieved certain scientific research results, she was evaluated as a senior talent category C in the &quot;Tianfu Talent Plan&quot; of Sichuan Tianfu New District in 2022. The new district will provide a subsidy of 500,000 yuan within five years. The following year, she applied for scientific research funds from the Chengdu Agricultural Science and Technology Talent Cultivation Program. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Right now, a laboratory in the institute is filled with freeze-dried fruit and vegetable solid drinks developed by Liu Hongyan’s team, and a whitening and moisturizing set containing phloretin. and other technological transformation achievements. This Inner Mongolian native has bought a house and settled in Chengdu. &quot;Currently, Chengdu is the city that best coordinates my work and life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Chengdu Youth Development Report (2022)&quot; released by the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Chengdu New Economic Development Research Institute shows that the population of &quot;Rongpiao&quot; reaches 6.8349 million. Among them, the proportion of young people from outside Sichuan Province is 21.85%, and the proportion of young people from &quot;Rongpiao&quot; who come from outside the province is 32.9%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Rongpiao Youth Talent Station, Jinjiang District, Chengdu.

He is just an ordinary person who loves life. In Chengdu, he felt another attraction of this city for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;30-year-old Hu Peng is from Leshan, Sichuan. He works as a tour guide in Chengdu, taking tourists to appreciate the different flavors of the city, including city gates, city walls, streets, and museums. , listen to historical stories and observe the lifestyle of local residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He developed two niche routes, one from Shaocheng in the west of the city to Fuqin, and the other from Xiner Village in the north of the city to Caojia Lane. In Fuqin, he had seen a cup of tea costing 3 yuan, and a bowl of noodles costing 89 yuan. The old man went out to eat noodles and drink tea in the morning, and sat there all day, feeling relaxed and happy. In Xiner Village, &quot;the size of the community is the size of the market.&quot; The market men and women lingered in the market in the morning, and he felt a vibrant beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Young people can always find the livable side of Chengdu. Science fiction writer Huo Zhongwu came to Chengdu in 2005 to study at university and settled here after graduation. He enjoys the pleasant cost of living here. Similarly, renting an apartment near the city center is about a quarter of that in Shanghai. A &quot;Rongpiao&quot; young man admitted to Southern Weekend reporters that one of the important reasons why he came to Chengdu to work three years ago was that Chengdu&#39;s housing prices are extremely cost-effective among provincial capital cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Have fun&quot; is a business card of Chengdu. Huo Zhongwu’s observation is that life in Chengdu is much slower than in first-tier cities, and there are always people in the teahouses and cafes on the roadside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Bai Ben was deeply impressed by a salon at the World Science Fiction Convention. A writer mentioned that he had seen a netizen post asking: It will be rare to have sunny weather in Chengdu tomorrow. Does anyone want to go to a high-rise building to watch the snow-capped mountains together? The writer went to the roof before dawn the next day, and there were already many people rubbing their hands and waiting. “This kind of thing is hard to imagine in other cities,” Bai Ben said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu has also captured the needs of talents for urban environment and quality of life. In 2022, Chengdu will launch the &quot;Talent New Deal 3.0&quot; version with excellent platforms and ecological management, attracting more young talents to take the initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When the water accumulates, fish gather&lt;span>;, and when trees grow thicker, birds gather.&quot; The relevant person in charge of the Talent Office of Chengdu Municipal Party Committee introduced that Chengdu has been We strive to protect the value attribution of talents with the highest quality services and create a value ecosystem where everyone is seen, respected and cared for. What can be proved is that Chengdu has been ranked first in &quot;China&#39;s happiest city&quot; for 14 consecutive years, ranked first in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#39;s &quot;Attractive Cities for College Students and Young Job Seekers&quot;, and won &quot;China&#39;s Best Talent Attracting City&quot; for 4 consecutive years. &quot;prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Talent work is ultimately inseparable from improving the quality of the city.&quot; For example, in order to cater to young people&#39;s fun-loving and quality-of-life mentality, Chengdu continues to optimize its environment , a 100-kilometer first-level greenway of the Ring Ecological Park has been built inside and outside the city ring expressway, with billowing green wheat fields, lush grassland, and swaying woods; while building a park city, Chengdu has opened up a large number of wetlands and green spaces As a camping site, &quot;everyone goes camping and basking in the sun on weekends&quot;, creating a new picture of urban life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 3, 2023, a unique &quot;underwater bookstore&quot; next to Xinglong Lake, a famous internet celebrity check-in place in Chengdu.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Resonance among young people&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu’s life scene that attracts young people also includes abundant public spaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The streets and alleys here hide &lt;span>;three&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;thousand&lt;/span>; more than one bookstore, far more than any other city in the country. It is difficult to count the number of public activities that are closely connected to it - reading clubs, movie viewing parties, script screenings, and sharing by scholars and experts. Some active spaces can host hundreds of events a year. The event was small in scale, with only twenty or thirty people at most, but it provided an opportunity for connection and resonance for countless young people eager to express, share, and see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Around 2015, Wang Miaomiao worked as an account manager for a brand company in Chengdu. At that time, she fell into depression for a time due to family reasons. She began to participate in a large number of offline public activities and spent three or four nights a week in various sharing sessions. Although most of the time, she couldn&#39;t understand what the sharer was saying, she liked the friendly and warm atmosphere, which allowed her to temporarily escape the pain in her life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Product manager Di Hao came to Chengdu to work in 2016. At the beginning, he couldn&#39;t find anyone he could play with, whether at work or in life. A year later, he saw the activities of the Toastmasters Club in the same city on Douban and tried to participate. Since then, he has been hooked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He has vivid memories of many activities. During the reading party, they read Tolstoy to understand human greed; after the movie viewing party, someone explained Plato&#39;s Allegory of the Cave. Once, scholar Wang Di came to a tavern in the suburbs of Chengdu to share. More than a hundred people came and &lt;span>;Wang Di&lt;/span>; talked until midnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Di Hao felt that the young friends who participated in the event gave him a sense of belonging. These activities also opened up a new world for Di Hao. In the past, when facing big figures, he had a sense of order based on distinction between superiority and inferiority. The egalitarian atmosphere of public activities gradually made him accustomed to dealing with others as an equal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After 2018, Hu Peng also often went to Chengdu to participate in public events. In his early years, he met a Polish man and a British man at a sharing meeting. They worked for a few months a year, teaching English and doing project planning, and the rest of the time was spent traveling around. This way of life surprised him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hu Peng prides himself on being a young man from a small town, having graduated with a bachelor&#39;s degree. Many people in his hometown have nothing to do in their spare time except playing cards. These activities made him realize that there was another possibility in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Also in 2018, Wang Miaomiao, who has participated in numerous public activities, became the director of Xunlu Library. This is a community library, but it aspires to become a &quot;humanistic beacon&quot;. Wang Miaomiao discovered that people lacked general education, so he invited professors from Sichuan University to come to the library to teach general education courses about Du Fu and visual culture. She listened to lawyer Zhang Ying&#39;s &quot;Bright Dialogue&quot; series of public debates and thought it was good, and invited Zhang Ying to the library for a discussion on psychology. Some participants said that these discussions responded to the rising enthusiasm for psychology since the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Miaomiao feels that these public lives have reshaped her life. She likes to study people and society, and is curious about where strong vitality is born, and the sharers &lt;span>;also&lt;/span>; responded to her questions in their own ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2023, she will become busier. Offline activities in Chengdu are very prosperous. In addition to creating more in-depth public activity content, she also needs to run a &quot;reclamation community&quot; that unites participants with reading as the core. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this corner of the southwest, public space is so prosperous, and Hu Peng connects it with the characteristics of the city. Chengdu has a tradition of chatting in teahouses and cafes. In addition, perhaps many busy young people are heading to first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The young people who come to Chengdu are more pursuing spiritual enrichment and yearning for a better life. They find resonance in Chengdu and at the same time inject new vitality into Chengdu&#39;s public life.

Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ji Ying will appear at the Jinsha Heritage Museum every Thursday morning. She is a volunteer guide here. Usually, after gathering seven or eight tourists, the team sets off. Along the way, there will be more and more listeners behind the red volunteer uniforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This 51-year-old Chengdu native was originally a manager of a foreign company. He traveled around the southwest and was busy and exhausted from work. After a serious illness, the doctor warned &quot;not to be too tired from now on&quot;, so the museum at home became a new choice. The company organized groups to come and listen to it several times. They were surprised by the colleague in front of them who talked about the ancient Shu civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more than 3.6 million people like her with dual identities in Chengdu. Zhang Zimeng, a student at Sichuan Conservatory of Music, is a volunteer in the &quot;Song is the Sweetest Medicine&quot; project. She goes to the hospital every week to serve as a vocal teacher for fifty or sixty &quot;Teletubbies&quot; suffering from severe spinal deformity; 37-year-old Express Member Tang Jian is the captain of the &quot;Maverick Pioneer Drivers&quot; volunteer service team. His team is a &quot;mobile probe&quot; that walks through the streets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are volunteer service stories that happen every day in every corner of Chengdu. Wei Na, the relevant person in charge of the Volunteer Service Department of the Propaganda Department of the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee, told Southern Weekend reporters that they have built a volunteer service platform &quot;Civilized Xingrong&quot; to use information technology to record all volunteer service information. Since the entire platform is in operation, there are nearly 40,000 registered volunteer teams in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chengdu is becoming a model city of &quot;City of Volunteers&quot;. Wei Na feels that this is a &quot;process of gathering glimmers of light&quot;: &quot;Looking at them separately, they are all small and microscopic, but together they are dedicated to the governance of the city and its happiness.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;“It’s so troublesome to be a volunteer”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is Ji Ying’s sixth year as a volunteer at the Jinsha Heritage Museum. “Without a strong belief, there is no way to persevere.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more than 60 volunteers in the museum, and the recruitment assessment of Ji Ying’s explanation team is recognized as strict. This &quot;novice on historical knowledge&quot; stumbled all the way. He passed the group interview, completed the first round of the relics museum&#39;s interpretation test, passed the written test, and passed the entire museum&#39;s interpretation interview, becoming a trainee volunteer. The entire assessment process lasted nearly seven months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first lesson of the volunteer training is to visit the museum, and the second lesson is to learn the team rules and regulations. The service hours are required to reach 120 hours per year, and in principle, they must come once a week. Ma Nong, a volunteer in the service group, was not used to it when he first arrived: &quot;I didn&#39;t expect that being a volunteer would be so troublesome, but it is so strict.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id =&quot;73774&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70565&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/0bf8bd712f.jpg&quot; img-title =&quot;ffa8c2a263ca7831b29090f0159f916.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Volunteers in red uniforms are explaining to tourists at the Jinsha Heritage Museum.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person who manages this volunteer team is Lu Lu, a staff member of the museum’s Department of Public Service and Social Education. &quot;We often call her King Lu or Little Leather Whip.&quot; Manong joked, &quot;King Lu&quot; is very strict. If you don&#39;t bring a work permit, you won&#39;t be allowed in, and the service time will not be counted. As time went by, she discovered that this strict compliance with the rules was equivalent to blocking out &quot;those who were not determined&quot;, leaving only those who really wanted to be volunteers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Lu told Southern Weekend reporters that she &quot;stated the rules and regulations upfront&quot; in the hope of conducting a double selection with volunteers. &quot;Without management, there is no cohesion. If you can accept it, we will happily work together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cohesion of the team is not only reflected in the system. Lu Lu will try her best to remember each volunteer’s birthday and lead everyone in the group to send blessings. At the end-of-year commendation meeting, she will contact the departments the volunteers have worked with and request them to issue certificates of honor to express respect and gratitude to the volunteers. &quot;Volunteer partners are not here for material things, so I hope to satisfy them in other ways that they are respected and needed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For museums with limited manpower, volunteers are important supplementary strength. Lu Lu mentioned that the museum has more than 30 docents, and during winter and summer vacations and popular holidays, the supply far exceeds demand, and volunteers can fill the seats. They announced the designated time for volunteers to give lectures, three in the morning and one in the afternoon, &quot;which can alleviate the demand to a great extent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The English translation volunteers in the translation team have a &quot;full schedule&quot; of work. The museum had tried a translation company, but it involved archaeological terminology and was more difficult. Instead, the museum&#39;s volunteer translation team was more competent - they had all passed CET-8 in English, and their academic qualifications were basically at least a master&#39;s degree. &quot;We have a lot of professional training, including the curator who will explain to us the excavation and historical origin of cultural relics, and we all understand them very clearly,&quot; said Lei Lei, the head of the translation team. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Overall scheduling from city to district&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the aforementioned &quot;Civilized Rong&quot; platform, there are an average of more than 500 various activities like this every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first intelligent platform in the country to fully support the practice of civilization and the development of volunteer service activities in the new era. It is understood that this smart platform can realize the complete record of volunteer service information. At the same time, it is also an important reference for award evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yi, deputy editor-in-chief of the Chengdu Volunteer Network, who is responsible for managing the platform, said that volunteer service activities in all districts and counties in Chengdu can be seen on the platform. “Its biggest function is to facilitate citizens to find activities and sign up to participate. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, there have been particularly many ecological and environmental protection activities on the platform. Liu Yi told Southern Weekend reporters that during the National Day holiday, the Chengdu Municipal Civilization Office linked 14 volunteer service stations on the greenway around the city to carry out cycling check-in activities. Chengdu’s city-ring greenway is a holy place for cycling enthusiasts, with a total length of 100 kilometers. &quot;The needs of citizens prompted us to extend civilized practices and volunteer services to the greenway scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 14 stations cooperate with each other and each has its own actions. Zhang Ying, chief of the Creation and Volunteer Service Section of the Propaganda Department of the Wenjiang District Party Committee, recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at that time, she was most worried about not attracting citizens to stop. The organizer put together the civilized blind box of the station into a map of China. Cyclists passing by would always stop and ask questions, which was very eye-catching. “Every day, our check-in points are crowded with people.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from the projects in the Jinsha Site Museum, this is a network of volunteer activities woven by government departments at all levels in Chengdu. An event lasting several days requires the cooperation of multiple departments. In the greenway station activities, civilized units at all levels play the main role, guiding and coordinating social organizations to participate in the assistance, and civilized units at the provincial, municipal, and district levels pair up to jointly build greenways. In the Wenjiang section of the Ring Greenway alone, the participating departments include the Wenjiang District Health Bureau, the District Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, and the District Education Bureau, with a total of more than 100 people from at least 12 units and enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The specific activities of the greenway station every day are also carried out by the responsible unit. Zhang Ying gave an example. The district health bureau is responsible for free TCM clinics, which provide health consultation services to citizens, teach first aid knowledge, and deal with sudden accidents such as cycling injuries and hiking sprains. The Wenjiang District Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital also dispatched medical team volunteers. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Zhang Ying, it is not difficult to connect various departments to participate in volunteer activities. The entire event is coordinated by the New Era Civilization Practice Center, and the district party secretary serves as the director of the center to implement the work. Before the start of a large-scale event, the Civilized Practice Center will hold a scheduling meeting, and all departments that need to cooperate with the event must attend the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to her, Wenjiang District is among the first batch of new era civilized practice center pilot projects in the province and the second batch in the country. A district-level center, nine towns and sub-districts, and 95 villages and communities have jointly built a three-level position where the Civilized Practice Center is located. It also has 8 professional volunteer service standing teams and multiple special volunteer service teams. “When we need it When the time comes, we can coordinate.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our volunteer service model in Chengdu is well coordinated from top to bottom. The civilized practice centers in each district and county have standardized systems, activities and organizational structures, which can promote this kind of service very well. Civilized practices and volunteer service activities are carried out on a regular basis.&quot; Zhang Ying concluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73771&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70562&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/69306910a6.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;839b8378c9c405b613355b1a9cb0de4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wenjiang District carries out activities at the Greenway Station during the National Day in 2023.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Volunteer service in &quot;Taobao Mall&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Establishing a points feedback incentive mechanism is an important part of building a city of volunteers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Volunteer time exchange for points and services, and related selection and recognition are common options for each project, and it is a top-down design. The &quot;Chengdu Volunteer Service Incentive Measures (Trial)&quot; launched by Chengdu City in 2019 is the country&#39;s first systematic volunteer service incentive system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, the framers wanted to link education, employment, settlement, etc. with volunteer services. Wei Na admitted that there are difficulties at the practical level, such as extra points for employment interviews or public examinations. Due to the lack of upper-level system support, it is difficult to clearly correlate volunteer service experience with the degree of extra points, and the basis is also difficult to quantify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are some areas where quantitative bonus points can be gained. For example, in the residence permit point statistics, volunteer service is worth 10 points. &quot;The previous policy was to add 100 points to get a household registration, and to participate in volunteer services, you can add 10 points. The points are still very impressive.&quot; She added that the Municipal Civilization Office has a dedicated person responsible for the points recognition of volunteer services, which has been changed to Normal operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, volunteer service is closely related to the comprehensive quality evaluation of primary and secondary school students in Chengdu. If you participate in the &quot;Civilized Rong&quot; volunteer project, the platform will automatically generate an official certificate, which will be used as a reference for school evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the &quot;Civilized Xingrong&quot; platform, volunteers can exchange points for corresponding rights and interests. Liu Yi nicknamed it the &quot;Taobao&quot; of volunteer service. The online points mall can be redeemed for items, training and services. Some communities will also upload incentive items, such as a pack of washing powder, a bag of rice, or a haircut card at the doorstep. &quot;We are actually using the concept of crowdfunding to provide courtesy and help for volunteer services.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Niushikou Street, which gave birth to the &quot;Maverick Pioneer Drivers&quot; volunteer service team, has created its own points incentive system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jie, a staff member of the Party and Mass Affairs Office of Niushikou Street, said that one point is equal to one yuan, which can be exchanged for mobile phone holders, ponchos, power banks and other items in the points mall, or you can choose coupons donated by caring companies. . The most popular redemption items are Hongqi supermarket chain cash coupons, which can be used directly for consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the volunteers of Jinsha Heritage Museum, the biggest incentive to give back is intangible. The suggestions they put forward always received support from the museum: inviting sanitation workers into the museum, accompanying nearly a hundred visually impaired friends to visit, and bringing the story of the &quot;Sun Bird&quot; into the community...these ideas that sprouted in practice, It has become a representative project of the museum’s volunteer activities, making the volunteers quite proud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audio program &quot;Xiao Zhi Hua Tian Fu&quot; led by Ji Ying was also born under this kind of autonomy. In the program, the &quot;Jinsha Maidens&quot; will use Chengdu dialect to explain the ancient Shu civilization and Tianfu culture in the 31st Universiade. &quot;We hope that through this program, more people will have a deeper understanding of Chengdu.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The seeds planted in 2008&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wei Na found that the soil had become thicker, and volunteering had gradually become a way of life for Chengdu people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the National Day holiday in 2023, a staff member of the Volunteer Service took his son to ride on the greenway around the city. When they arrived at the Baiye section of Jiaozi in Wuhou District, they saw that the volunteers were very busy. My 16-year-old son stopped, signed up on the spot, and worked as a volunteer at the inn for two hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her parents have also spontaneously joined the elderly volunteer association in the community. Various volunteer services are often announced in the association group. My father will participate in chorus programs to celebrate festivals for residents; my mother will participate in river patrols every week, walking with friends in the same unit to check whether there are any fishing issues during closed seasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten years ago, two old people came to this strange city to help take care of their children. By participating in volunteer service activities in the community, they got to know the elderly people around them and established their own social circle. At present, I have sold my house in my hometown and chose to settle in Chengdu. She smiled and said, &quot;Because they love this city very much, and they are also very active in community activities after settling here. They are really super backbones.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wei Na&#39;s view, Chengdu people have a strong sense of belonging in their hearts. Philanthropic sentiment: &quot;The year 2008, when the earthquake occurred, can actually be called the first year of volunteer service in Chengdu. We were the place where the disaster occurred, and there were NGOs from all over the world, and many volunteers came to help us.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;For philanthropist Xu Zhen, the seed of volunteering was planted in 2008. At that time, many rescue teams and volunteers from all over the world poured into Sichuan, and those helping hands left a deep impression on her. Four or five years later, when she was in college, she wanted to join the school&#39;s volunteer association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, as the person in charge of the &quot;Song is the Sweetest Medicine&quot; project of Cloud Public Welfare, she has been serving &quot;Teletubbies&quot; with volunteers for nearly seven years. When she first saw these patients with severe spinal deformity, their heads and waists were covered with steel rings, which were connected and fixed by four support rods above their heads. This physical condition gave Xu Zhen a very strong intuition. impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually, volunteers will take patients to do vocal exercises, exhale to make a rhythm, and make a &quot;hissing&quot; sound on their mouths to exercise their breath. This is a part of the treatment process and is customized by the director of the orthopedics department of the hospital. From admission to discharge, &quot;Teletubbies&quot; will grow an average of 20 centimeters in height and usher in a new life. Xu Zhen was especially pleased when she saw someone in the group changed the note to &quot;discharged&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More volunteer seeds are being planted continuously in the &quot;One Hour a Week&quot; project carried out by the Chengdu Volunteer Network. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Hong, leader of the &quot;One Hour a Week&quot; project team, introduced that they advocate citizens to participate in at least one hour of volunteer service every week. In the four years since the project was launched, there have been more than 170 online and offline activities, more than 80,000 volunteers participated, and more than 5 million people have been served. During the Chengdu Universiade, citizens were encouraged to upload moments of civilized viewing of the games. After the Universiade, a micro-story collection was launched for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For her, &quot;one hour per week&quot; is a habit-forming task, so she tries to lower the threshold for volunteer service participation and increase the number of participants and coverage. The &quot;shoot as you go&quot; activity, which is being vigorously promoted, can be participated in anywhere in the city. As long as you take photos of civilized behaviors and upload them five times, you can get electronic certificates, volunteer service hours and points. “The ultimate goal is to inspire our citizens to identify with volunteer services, identify with the friendly atmosphere of the city, and be willing to contribute to the civilization and friendliness of the city.” Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Micro-governance of “two-way running”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In this city of volunteers, volunteers serve others and are also served. This &quot;two-way rush&quot; is already a kind of urban public governance on a micro level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Hongjixin Road in Jinjiang District, a conspicuous courtyard has a sign reading &quot;Brother Xiao Niu·Sha Yi Jie&quot;. This is a 24-hour love station and a resting place for new employment groups such as express delivery, takeaway, and online ride-hailing drivers. Gao Linya, the person in charge of the &quot;Little Niu Brother&quot; project, said that there are already 35 sites like this in Jinjiang District. From replenishing water and charging, to psychological consultation, labor safety protection, employment guidance services, vocational skills training, holding free clinics, etc., they are all options at the station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early demand survey, the &quot;Little Niu Brother&quot; team found that what couriers and delivery people needed most was charging services, so they specially coordinated with a company to set up six charging stations at the entrance of the community opposite the post station. Set charging cabinet. &quot;&#39;Brother Maverick&#39; has not only served these groups from the beginning, but also guided them to participate in social services, forming a closed-loop logic of two-way services.&quot; Gao Linya said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73773&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70564&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/0e329f974d.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;79c93e56795144985b1569ca6447dd5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;Brother Maverick·Shake Kick&quot; Station.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also motivating citizens to participate in urban governance is Zhang Haibo, secretary-general of the Chengdu Urban and Rural Community Development and Governance Promotion Association. He unites universities and communities, and college students independently launch refined volunteer services. The communities list their needs, and students in corresponding majors provide professional services. &quot;Let students see the value of their own subjects during the process of volunteer service, which will facilitate subsequent life planning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the scope of stimulation has gradually expanded. Zhang Haibo built a youth volunteer service innovation laboratory to organize service projects based on problems. Zhang Haibo was deeply impressed by the &quot;Breaking Action&quot; launched in the summer of 2023 to prevent left-behind children from being addicted to mobile phones. College student volunteers also invited players from the Chengdu AG e-sports team to play games with the children. &quot;Our idea at the time was , we’ll talk about it after we’re convinced.” He smiled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such micro-governance occurs in every corner of the city. Takeaway riders travel through the streets and actively upload social governance clues while delivering food. Gao Linya introduced that governance clues are divided into eight categories, including accident emergency and damage to public facilities. The street has dedicated personnel to review and deal with the clues, and feed back the problems to the corresponding departments at the grassroots level. If they cannot be solved, they will continue to be reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For some things within their capabilities, volunteers are encouraged to &quot;find and solve them by themselves&quot; and actively participate in grassroots governance services. Discovering the problem of random storage of shared bicycles and sorting them out is equivalent to gaining points for two clues. For more than two years of the project operation, there are more than 500 people in the background, and more than 3,000 social governance clues collected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Our group of people may feel embarrassed to do (volunteer). With encouragement and promotion, there are additional rewards after finishing, and the enthusiasm will get up. In the end Come inside. &quot;The courier Tang Jian sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
