After the transaction is completed, McDonald&#39;s Global, as a minority shareholder, will increase its shareholding ratio from 20% to 48%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is reported that the acquisition requires regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2024. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, the acquisition price is US$1.8 billion, and Carlyle will receive a return of approximately 6.7 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If it weren’t for the current VC/PE market project withdrawal slump, Carlyle might have been able to sell it at a higher price.” A partner from a domestic PE institution lamented to reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reporters have learned from various sources that the industry generally believes that Carlyle’s sale of McDonald’s China shares at a relatively low price is likely to be closely related to the current difficulty in exiting VC/PE market projects and its sluggish performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of November, Carlyle announced its third quarter financial report of this year, which showed that the total revenue for the quarter was only US$562 million, a simultaneous decrease of about 50%, and the net profit was only US$81.3 million, a year-on-year decrease of 71.05%. The main reason for Carlyle&#39;s revenue decline in the quarter was that it was difficult to exit projects, which resulted in a 76% drop in performance income from exited investment projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Carlyle’s fundraising scale this year has basically been the same as in 2022, but far lower than the same period in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“To change this situation, Carlyle urgently needs more project exit cases, but given the current sluggish IPO market and the increased risk of a U.S. economic recession, Carlyle may have to sell at a lower price More high-quality projects and create more project exit cases to win LPs’ commitment to Carlyle’s new fund.” Analyzed the partner of a domestic PE institution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, project mergers and acquisitions between industrial capital and PE are quite common during periods of increased macroeconomic fluctuations. However, this time industrial capital had the upper hand in M&amp;A negotiations because during the previous period when the Federal Reserve implemented extremely loose monetary policies, industrial capital raised a large amount of funds by issuing bonds or borrowing from banks at extremely low interest rates; in comparison, PE However, due to the sluggish IPO market and the sharp interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in recent years, institutions have encountered difficulties in project exit and new fund raising. As a result, PE institutions have to sell high-quality assets to industrial capital at low prices to create more project exit cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Nowadays, industrial capital with abundant funds has become the taker for PE institutions eager to exit the project, but the former will also force the PE institutions to make more concessions in order to obtain more generous bargain hunting profits. &quot;A M&amp;A fund manager pointed out to reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;behind&quot; Carlyle&#39;s sale of McDonald&#39;s China shares&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Reporters have learned that in April, the market began to hear rumors that Carlyle was planning to sell its shares in McDonald&#39;s China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, people familiar with the matter revealed that Carlyle and Trustar Capital, a private equity subsidiary of CITIC Capital Holdings Co., Ltd., are offering to sell part of McDonald’s China Company for US$4 billion. Among them, Carlyle Lei will sell 28% of McDonald&#39;s China Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person familiar with the matter also said that Carlyle and Xinchen Capital were in discussions with the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, hoping that they could Participated in the acquisition, and their overall valuation of McDonald&#39;s China Company was US$10 billion, that is, the 28% stake held by Carlyle was valued at US$2.8 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it was McDonald’s Global that finally made the move. And Carlyle is the only one selling equity in McDonald&#39;s China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of many PE industry insiders, McDonald’s China is actually an important high-quality asset in Carlyle’s PE investment portfolio. In 2017, CITIC and Carlyle acquired McDonald&#39;s businesses in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau for US$2.08 billion and obtained 20-year franchise rights in the two places. CITIC and Carlyle formulated a plan for McDonald&#39;s China The &quot;Five-Year Plan&quot; strives to expand the number of McDonald&#39;s restaurants to 4,500 by 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, McDonald&#39;s has more than 5,500 stores in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. In recent years, McDonald&#39;s China sales have maintained a growth of more than 30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They believe that an important factor that forced Carlyle to decide to sell this &quot;high-quality asset&quot; was weak performance. The recent third-quarter financial report released by Carlyle showed that both total revenue and net profit experienced significant year-on-year declines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This will definitely affect Carlyle’s new fund-raising.” The aforementioned domestic PE institutional partner believes. Normally, when a PE institution plans to issue a new fund to raise funds, it will first return most of the investment principal and income of the previous fund to investors (LPs) to boost their interest in continuing to invest in the new fund. confidence. On the other hand, if the previous fund project exits slowly and cannot return sufficient principal income to LPs, it will affect the rise of LPs to continue investing. In this case, PE institutions can only sell high-quality projects to industrial capital at low prices to create more project exit cases and return principal and interest, in order to win the &quot;commitment&quot; of LPs to continue investing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In sharp contrast, in July this year, large European PE institutions completed the fundraising of their ninth M&amp;A fund, with a scale of 26 billion euros, setting a record for the largest fundraising of a M&amp;A fund. This is mainly due to the fact that CVC has achieved the exit of a number of large-scale investment projects in the past year, including the sale of Messer Industries shares to Messer and the sale of energy exploration company Neptune Energy Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rob Lucas, managing partner of CVC, said that the exit of these projects will help promote the fundraising of new funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Obviously, Carlyle’s management team also realizes that without enough project exit cases and return of principal interests, the new phase of fund raising will face many challenges, especially it will be difficult to convince LPs Continue to inject capital.&quot; The domestic PE institution partner said frankly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&amp;nbsp;Industrial capital is waiting for PE to make more &quot;concessions&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to selling equity in McDonald&#39;s China, Carlyle has recently been operating multiple sales projects to further increase its Number of project exits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, there were market rumors that Carlyle was seeking to sell German software company SER and Japanese cosmetics supplier Tokiwa Corp. At the same time, Carlyle also plans to sell off its shares in AmbioPharm, a peptide active pharmaceutical ingredient CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) company, valuing the company at approximately US$1 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of industry insiders, this means that Carlyle is selling more projects to quickly reverse the decline in financial performance and return more investment principal profits to LPs. Earn their “commitment” to continue investing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the current economic environment, it will not be easy to sell the above projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that in the first six months of this year, global PE funds received less than US$37.7 billion through exit channels such as portfolio listings and acquisitions, falling to the lowest level in the past 10 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Even though the market recently expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates soon and the U.S. economy remains resilient, industrial capital is not enthusiastic about acquisitions.&quot; The person in charge of the above-mentioned M&amp;A fund told reporters. The reasons are: First, more and more industrial capitals are not optimistic about the future global economic development prospects, and would rather retain more funds to &quot;overwinter&quot; than to rush into mergers and acquisitions and encounter the risk of M&amp;A failure; secondly, some industrial capitals also know that PE Institutions are eager to create project exit cases to return principal income to LP (for the purpose of raising funds for a new phase of funds), and are waiting for PE institutions to further lower the project sales price, thereby obtaining higher bargaining returns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This forces more and more large PE institutions to make more concessions on price in order to complete project mergers and acquisitions and exit as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July, Tiger Fund transferred its remaining shares in Flipkart, a large Indian e-commerce company, to Walmart for a total transaction value of US$1.4 billion. This corresponds to a valuation of Flipkart of US$35 billion, which is lower than Tiger Fund’s previous investment in Flipkart. Valuation of Flipkart at US$38 billion in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Currently, most industrial capital with abundant funds are not eager to make acquisitions. They are still evaluating whether acquisitions can have an immediate boost in improving corporate performance.&quot; The head of the M&amp;A fund said bluntly . This has made PE institutions even more anxious, because the global IPO market downturn in the past two years has prevented PE institutions from returning considerable principal returns to LPs, which is causing LPs to question the project exit capabilities of PE institutions. Once this situation continues, more and more LPs will eventually vote with their feet for PE institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It is foreseeable that in order to achieve more project mergers and acquisitions and exits, many large global PE institutions can only continue to lower their status and lower project sales prices, and strive to create more project exit cases. This must not be allowed. LPs continue to question their ability to exit projects, because this will greatly weaken the industry reputation and image of these large PE institutions in the VC/PE market.&quot; He analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“23000塔卡薪资抗议”：国际大牌背后的孟加拉国“血汗工厂”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261306]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-25 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;Working 8 hours a day during the day, there are usually 2 hours of paid overtime.

This money can hardly afford to live with inflation and high prices due to the new crown epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Bangladesh’s cheap labor has brought huge profits. According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics of Bangladesh, in 2022, the production value of the textile industry will account for more than 13% of Bangladesh&#39;s total GDP, and the country relies on clothing exports to make US$55 billion in profits every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the silent volcano erupted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/1706045b48.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/1706045b48.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259581&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;During this round of protests, Bangladeshi police are using sticks to drive away female garment workers.

When Southern Weekend reporters tried to contact several female garment workers, they were unable to get a reply because they were unable to communicate in English. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fahem mentioned that some female workers don’t even know how to type on their mobile phones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/73ff85113b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/73ff85113b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259582&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;The income of female garment workers in Bangladesh is only half that of female workers in India and Cambodia.

Bangladeshi textile workers hope that employers can triple the minimum wage to 23,000 taka - garment workers believe that 23,000 taka is the baseline for maintaining food and clothing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gazipur, Asuriya and other industrial cities are the core areas of the &quot;Taka 23,000 salary protest&quot;.

Visual China | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Songjiang River in Shanghai was called &quot;Yunjian&quot; in ancient times. When I first moved to Songjiang, it felt a bit like &quot;between the clouds&quot; - empty and silent, misty and deserted. There are no acquaintances. Naturally, there were no familiar delicacies. I thought I would start a lonely life and start everything from scratch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, I was suddenly called by my name on the quiet road that day. I couldn&#39;t help but be startled. I took a closer look at a fat lady, but I didn&#39;t recognize her, but she smiled and said, I often watch on TV. I see you here, why are you here? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turned out to be Jin Mei, my childhood neighbor. Hearing that her mother was still alive, she couldn&#39;t help but be surprised: New sister-in-law, is she still there? ! It&#39;s about ninety, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ninety-seven!&quot; Jin Mei replied. I immediately asked to see her. Because when she was a child, she was a popular idol in the alley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;New Sister-in-law&quot; is probably called famous by a group of old people. The reason must be that she was a bride in the alley back then. It is said that many people want to see a new wife who can&#39;t cook and make a fool of herself, but the new sister-in-law&#39;s skills make many older people feel inferior to her. What makes many women obey the most is that she actually raised eight boys and one girl in one go. Her youngest daughter Jinmei is my classmate. Behind her back, the old ladies call her &quot;Laikehang&quot; (a kind of foreign chicken that is very good at laying eggs). ). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although her ancestral home is Shaoxing, she is more proficient than ordinary people when it comes to &quot;being a good person&quot;. When people in Shanghai say that people &quot;can be a good person&quot;, they are praising a kind of &quot;intelligent frugality&quot;, which is left-brained and right-brained. Living a life by discussing things is not just living a stingy life. For example, using mature loofah tendons to wash dishes is far better than sponges, but the price is negligibly cheap; cutting discarded sweatshirts into strips of cloth to tie into mops is much better absorbent than yarn; buying meat at a &quot;small market&quot; You can be precise enough to buy only 2 taels, which is enough to fry shredded pork for a meal. This is in contrast to the honest and honest people in the north who often buy half a fan, forming a &quot;precision&quot;. When you go to a restaurant to eat, most of the leftovers have to be packed up and re-cooked at home, called &quot;zaluo soup&quot;. The most typical one is the invention of the &quot;fake leader&quot; in Shanghai, which uses the least amount of fabric to maintain the greatest dignity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But these &quot;life skills&quot; are just &quot;mere&quot; in the eyes of the new sister-in-law. She has her own unique skills, and they are beyond everyone&#39;s imagination, which makes the whole alley admire her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin’s sister-in-law’s hometown has a lot of bamboo shoots, and every year a lot of bamboo shoots are brought there by people. In order to preserve them, Xin’s sister-in-law always boils the bamboo shoots in a large pot of salted water, cuts the cooked bamboo shoots into pieces, and air-dries them. The old soup used to cook the bamboo shoots is not changed, and is cooked batch by batch. Finally, the old soup is slightly thick, and the large bottle and large wine bottle are poured in sequentially. The whole process does not touch the water, and the wine bottle is sealed with oil paper. This is the &quot;soy sauce&quot; for cooking in her family. &quot;. They call it &quot;bamboo shoot oil&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, good red soy sauce cost 27 cents per catty, white soy sauce (fresh soy sauce) cost 21 cents per catty, and MSG was even more expensive. But with the bamboo shoot oil, her family never buys soy sauce and MSG. My grandmother often orders me to go to her house and buy a bottle. The freshness is better than the soy sauce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new sister-in-law also pickles bacon every year, adds coarse salt and pepper, and pours some sorghum wine. The strange thing is that she is reluctant to throw away the reddish marinated meat water. She &quot;makes meat with meat&quot; and uses the marinated meat water to cook braised pork. Just add a little red soy sauce to make the meat very red and fragrant. Neighboring, the kind of fragrance between &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;wax&quot; is almost indescribable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what we miss the most is her &quot;Yanqiu&quot; - the new sister-in-law Yanqiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Specially difficult period&quot;, considering that her family is a &quot;super-large family&quot; of 11 people, eight boys, and eight &quot;tiger&quot;, it is natural that there is a serious shortage of meat resources. Anyone who wants to touch big meat Their thoughts were not only &quot;immoral&quot;, but directly &quot;cheating&quot;, but the new sister-in-law&#39;s &quot;Shaoxing-style wisdom&quot; actually solved them as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time she stopped at the market, a storm would rush through her eyes - in the fish stall, there were dead white fish (silver carp), as cheap as mud, the most undesirable, and the new sister-in-law would kill them with a move. &quot;Here are two, big ones!&quot; The stall owner was so flattered that he offered them at the lowest price. In the meat stall, people walked around the milk fat pork, the loosest fat on the pork belly, and the stall owner often felt worried about it. At this time, the new sister-in-law waved her pink arm and said, &quot;Two pounds here!&quot; The stall owner was like Feng Lunyin. Not only did he cut the meat wide, but he also charged the floor price, and often even refused to charge for the meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jin Mei and I love watching our new sister-in-law make swallow balls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I saw her quickly removing the scales, gills and internal organs of the fish, and then rinsed it clean. Then cut it in half from head to tail, remove the bones and large spines, cut off the head and belly of the fish (reserve for fish soup), leaving two large pieces of fish meat, skin side down, place on the chopping board and nail them For the fish tail, hold the sharp knife upright and scrape the fish meat from the outside inward. When the skin and red meat under the skin are left, the new sister-in-law said proudly, many people don’t understand and are greedy for this piece of red meat! In fact, you must not ask for red meat. The fishy smell comes from the red meat! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My new sister-in-law chopped the scraped fish meat repeatedly and finely, saying that all the fish bones were gone. Then I put it in a container, stirred it clockwise for a few minutes with two pairs of chopsticks, added salt, and stirred it until it bubbles. , then picked up the milk and fat meat. Chop the cooked milk fat pork and lard residue together, add starch and chopped green onion and ginger, then mix in the fish paste and mix well until thickened, and shape into fish balls. Because of the abundant raw materials, she made the fish balls larger. It is as big as a ping pong ball or even a tennis ball. It is cooked in a pot of boiling water for a while. It is as white and crystal clear as snow. It is as tender and smooth as tofu in the mouth. It is not fishy and delicious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why we treat it as a swallow ball every time is because every time we can taste one first and squeal with joy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night was a carnival where the eight boys and her husband had a &quot;meat feast&quot; - when the big pot of swallow balls was served, the new sister-in-law had to use the spoon solemnly with a straight face. They were strictly allocated one by one. If it were left to them, it might be a dinner table accident with blood splattering three feet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the story is not over yet. The &quot;Eight Tigers&quot; had eaten all the swallow balls, and there must be a by-product of the swallow balls, &quot;fish soup&quot;, waiting for them the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After my new sister-in-law cooked the tripe that was chopped off yesterday, she removed the fish, removed the spines, chopped the fat meat into pieces, mixed it with the fish and added it to the soup. Add vinegar and salt. Sprinkle in a lot of celery leaves or minced garlic, the aroma is fragrant, fresh and slightly sour, and the big pot of brown rice is gone in an instant. It can be described as more than just &quot;dinner&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While being jealous, a group of old women headed by my grandma often commented quietly: This dish actually comes from Hangzhou cuisine. The most outstanding thing is that it uses the most unwanted &quot;trash&quot;. And make it delicious. Who wants this dead white fish? If it cannot be sold, it will rot; who will buy this fat meat? If it can&#39;t be sold, it can only be boiled in oil residue. But with her help, the New Year&#39;s Eve dinner can be served. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gradually, everyone put down their arrogance and asked the new sister-in-law for advice; gradually, the fish stalls and meat stalls in the vegetable market, those &quot;abandoned items&quot; that no one usually touched, were noticed... &lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Gradually, it became the most popular, affordable and nourishing home-cooked dish in our alley. The official name given to it by the neighbors was &quot;Xinsao Yanqiu&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many years have passed, the time has almost changed, and the alleys have disappeared, but how many generations, especially the &quot;eight tigers&quot; have grown up eating the cheapest and most delicious &quot;big meat&quot; , joining a job, getting married - and even getting older, my new sister-in-law is actually still alive! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I stood in front of her bed. To be honest, at ninety-seven, she was too old to remember me, but when she talked about her swallow balls, her eyeballs flashed a few times. He pursed his lips and said nonchalantly: &quot;...It&#39;s a pity that there was no oil at that time. In fact, it tastes better if it is deep-fried!...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10月全国查处违反中央八项规定精神问题9567起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261314]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 23:09:54&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the 23rd, the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission released monthly data on the investigation and punishment of mental problems that violate the eight central regulations.

Originally, children can jump more than 190 times per minute, but this kind of skipping rope can only jump 160 times. If it were not required by the school, I would definitely I won’t buy it.” Mr. Huang, a citizen of Hangzhou, said that his son will take the high school entrance examination next year, and the sports test will be skipping rope. Since the brand of skipping rope chosen for the Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination was &quot;Hengyou&quot;, in order to familiarize the children with the rope used for the exam in advance, he had no choice but to buy this skipping rope after being designated by the school teacher. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“I checked the same type of rope online. One rope only costs more than ten yuan, and this one costs 78 yuan.” Similar to Mr. Huang, a primary school student in Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City Ms. Lu, the parent of a second-grade student, said that almost all of the 39 students in her child&#39;s class bought &quot;Hengyou&quot; brand skipping ropes at the teacher&#39;s request. Some parents even bought two, one for practicing at home and one for practicing at school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In August 2020, five departments including the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening and Standardizing the Management of Education Fees&quot;, which clarified that &quot;students and parents shall not be forced or implied to purchase designated fees.&quot; Teaching aid software or materials”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why do some schools recommend buying this rope even though it is explicitly prohibited? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hangzhou said frankly that rope skipping is a must-test sports event for grades one to six in primary schools; in middle schools, it is also one of the items in the high school entrance examination. Since the rope used in Hangzhou&#39;s high school entrance examination is &quot;Hengyou&quot;, some primary schools also use &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping ropes to compete with middle schools. &quot;It is better to use it early than to use it late. We will recommend parents to buy the &#39;Hengyou&#39; rope to strengthen training, but teachers are not forced to buy it. The school will also provide corresponding skipping ropes to try to meet the needs of students.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A junior high school student in Hangzhou told reporters that because the &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping rope is relatively expensive, she usually uses rubber ropes that cost a few yuan a piece when practicing at home; Practice with the school&#39;s &quot;Hengyou&quot; rope. &quot;Some students in the class who are from well-off families also bought a &#39;Hengyou&#39; rope with a Bluetooth counting function, which costs more than 140 yuan.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter investigated and learned that, Some head teachers or physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hangzhou asked parents to purchase ropes of this brand by verbal notification or by sending links to parents in groups. The customer service of the Hengyou Sports Taobao flagship store said that the Hangzhou high school entrance examination skipping rope provides &quot;Hengyou&quot;, and many schools in Hangzhou Shangcheng, Gongshu, and Xiaoshan recommend buying this rope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Coach Huang from a &quot;rope skipping class&quot; in Hangzhou told reporters that more than 20 primary and secondary school students who came to his training also felt that the rope used for the high school entrance examination had heavy handles and thick ropes. Other ropes are easy to jump on. &quot;In order to prepare for the exam, the children can only sign up for training classes.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Why did the &quot;Hengyou&quot; rope become a special rope for Hangzhou&#39;s high school entrance examination? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Is there a standard for the rope used in the high school entrance examination? Shen Hao, deputy director of the Hangzhou Municipal Education Examination Institute, who is responsible for purchasing sports equipment for the Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination, said that neither the country nor the province has standards for ropes used in the high school entrance examination. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is understood that the national skipping rope standard stipulates the length and diameter of the rope and the diameter and weight of the handle, but this standard is a recommended standard. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“In fact, the length of the rope and the thickness of the handle of the &#39;Hengyou&#39; skipping rope are designed according to adult standards, which is not suitable for primary school students - primary school students are small and weak.

The original equipment rental service provider for the physical education high school entrance examination equipment and examination system developed is Hangzhou Xingti Education Technology Co., Ltd. The equipment system operates stably, the service response is fast, and the high school entrance examination physical examination tasks are successfully completed every year. From the continuity of use, the examination system Considering the integrity and specificity of the software management platform, it meets the condition of &#39;can only purchase from the only supplier&#39; in single-source procurement.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Shen Hao said, ten For many years, Hangzhou Sports High School Entrance Examination has been leasing equipment from the manufacturer &quot;Hengyou&quot;, including skipping ropes, skipping rope testers, etc., so the result is that the rope used in the high school entrance examination today is &quot;Hengyou&quot;. In addition, this company is one of the earliest manufacturers to develop intelligent counting rope skipping. Compared with the past, invigilators used to count the number of rope skipping by candidates with their eyes, this kind of intelligent counting is fairer and more efficient. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“It is actually not profitable to lease physical examination equipment to the Hangzhou Education Examination Authority. Our market is more of the market for primary and secondary school students, which is under the physical examination mechanism of primary and secondary schools.

The prices of &#39;Hengyou&#39; non-counting and counting skipping ropes are respectively sold at 78 The price is 148 yuan, and the profit margin is huge.&quot; revealed a brand merchant in Zhejiang that produces skipping ropes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Anti-Monopoly Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs shall not abuse administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition. &quot;If the education and examination department uses a certain brand of skipping rope for a long time without justifiable reasons, especially if it simply purchases a certain product through the &#39;single source&#39; procurement method without extensive investigation and understanding of market products, it is obviously against fair competition in the market.

There are people specially guarding the place, and the elderly are free to enter. There are many small benches inside, and loudspeakers are turned on. Young people are on the stage preaching the efficacy of a certain product, and then encouraging the elderly to buy it. Obviously, this is a product promotion meeting, but it has two obvious characteristics: first, the promotion location is in the village, located in a pure rural area; second, the sales target is the elderly, and they are all left-behind elderly people in rural areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is a sales meeting or a merchant advertising, it cannot be said that there are many violations, but upon closer inspection, it is still full of &quot;routines.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About daily arrangements. It is understood that this kind of sales meeting usually lasts for 6-7 days. In the first 4-5 days, someone will explain the relevant knowledge to make the elderly believe it. One of the common tricks is to exaggerate certain aspects of the elderly&#39;s problems based on the characteristics of the product to be promoted. For example, when promoting water purifiers, one would say how poor the quality of water commonly used in rural areas is and what harm it causes to the body. The purpose It makes the elderly feel that if they do not buy their products, the consequences will be very serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second trick is to frequently use some scientific and technological means during the explanation process, such as on-site testing of water quality, using special instruments, professional testing methods, and demonstrations by academicians and scientists to convince the villagers. This is scientific, advanced and developed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third trick is that a group of people will jointly &quot;perform&quot; the explanation process, including outsiders, locals, and perhaps people who are quite prestigious in the local area. The business owner&#39;s assumption is that you don&#39;t have to believe it. Foreigners, but locals should believe it, right? There is a high probability that merchants bribe a small number of local people through money and other means. The goods will be sold in the next 1-2 days. That is to say, there is a process of first acting with emotion, convincing people with reason, first brainwashing, winning people&#39;s hearts, and finally harvesting (money). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About identity changes. A few days ago, merchants used various videos, speeches, performances, etc. to gain the trust of the elderly. In the process, the merchants transformed into many roles. A few days ago, they were outsiders and they were technology explanators in the countryside. Members, they are rural revitalization helpers, they are psychologists who are familiar with and understand the psychology of the elderly, they are health guardians who care about the physical and mental health of the elderly, and they are philanthropists who send warmth to the countryside; two days later, they returned to their The essential role - a profit-seeking businessman, a villain and a villain who defrauds honest village elders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About what is sold and given away. What they ultimately want to sell is a certain brand of water purifier, and the items they give away are divided into two types: a few days ago, they were paper towels, wash basins, toothpaste, toothbrushes, washing powder, and laundry detergent. Only those who came to the scene could see it. portion; the next two days are range hoods, wall breakers and heating and cooling air conditioners. Obviously, the gifts given a few days ago were mostly cheap and practical things in rural areas. As long as you go there, they will give them to you. When people go there, there are so many people, it is easy to cover the eyes of some onlookers. Yes, there are people. A herd mentality, especially for old people in the countryside. They will think, &quot;Are they all fools, right? I&#39;ll go take a look too.&quot; The gifts in the next two days are also very practical, but anyone with a discerning eye will know at a glance that they are not cheap, but the condition is that you have to spend money to buy the net. Water vessels are only given by others. In other words, the things they sell and give away are not cheap. This method of selling one large item and getting three large items for free makes many elderly people feel that this business is full of sincerity and is not a profiteer in the ordinary sense. , some old people even stood up to speak for them, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter even if they are cheated in the end. Thousands of dollars are gone, but at least four real things are in hand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About price. Take the main product for sale, water purifiers, as an example. My mother told me that the price is 2,980 yuan per unit. I simply searched on regular e-commerce platforms such as JD.com and Taobao and found that I can buy it for only 400-500 yuan. Find similar products with good quality. Faced with such a huge price difference, merchants&#39; compensation tactics include intimidation, bragging and gifts. What’s even more annoying is that my mother told me that the merchant would say that the price of 2,980 yuan was still a lowered price after enjoying the national subsidy policy for technology products going to the countryside. In other words, the original price may be 4,980 yuan per unit. Now it is the business that benefits the people. After deducting the 2,000 yuan of state subsidies, the villagers have a rare opportunity and opportunity to buy one unit for 2,980 yuan. As soon as these words came out, the old people&#39;s previous defensive mentality was easily defeated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About people entering. My mother told me that those people were very friendly. Every morning at seven o&#39;clock, the car would arrive at the entrance of the village on time, pick up the elderly in the village, and prepare breakfasts such as fried dough sticks, steamed buns, and milk for the elderly, and deliver them to the sales meeting for free. When we arrived at the scene, someone brought us tea and water, and the service was quite attentive. At twelve o&#39;clock at noon, the car took the elderly home on time to cook and eat. At two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, the car will appear in the village on time, waiting for the elderly; at 5:30, they will take the elderly back to their homes. A friend of mine who is about the same age as me told me that a similar activity was held in their village last weekend. He wanted to go into the shed and have a look, but did not want to be dissuaded by the person guarding the door. The meaning was obvious, only the elderly could enter, and young people could not go in. , middle-aged people, don’t give in. Obviously, businesses are afraid of the presence of young or middle-aged people because they are worried that young or middle-aged people will expose their tricks in public, and young people or middle-aged people will openly oppose them, which will seriously affect the elderly. purchasing psychology, reducing the purchasing intention of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above is the relevant situation that I heard or learned, which triggered some other thoughts in me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the basic fact is that some businesses defraud ignorant elderly people in the countryside under the guise of &quot;expanding domestic demand&quot; and &quot;enjoying national subsidies for technological products sent to the countryside.&quot; To be honest, many product manufacturing companies exist in name only. However, under market-oriented conditions, although many companies persist, their main products have long been eliminated by the market. Especially in urban markets, they are already saturated. What should we do? Of course, the company just thought about it and moved its tentacles downwards to occupy the urban and rural markets. There is no doubt that this is a move by companies to expand domestic demand. However, it is difficult to say how good the quality of this type of product is, and the price is many times higher than the price of similar products purchased online. It is undeniable that there is deception and fraud in the product sales process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the abnormal behavior of rural elderly deserves scrutiny. First, why do elderly people who have been living frugally for most of their lives not hesitate or feel distressed when faced with a large purchase of close to 3,000 yuan? I think there is a problem of transfer of family (words) rights (power) here. Nowadays, most of the things in many people’s homes are purchased online by their children outside the home. You buy it and I use it. In the past, I bought it and everyone used it. Now that I am old, I don’t need to buy it. You and your children buy it. That&#39;s good. I don&#39;t have much contribution to this family anymore, at least not as much as before. The elderly are more of just passive recipients of gifts and users of objects. They have little opportunity or need to participate in the purchase and sale of objects, especially large items. The process of selection, screening and purchasing is a deprivation of consumption. Now there is such an opportunity, I pay, I buy, I make the decision, I am happy. Even if they find out in the end that they have been fooled and deceived, they will feel distressed to some extent, but they will also accept the reality calmly, &quot;Where is the use of money other than money? I just spend money to buy something? You can easily spend hundreds of dollars on a meal in Guangzhou. Thousands, you think I don’t know? It’s too expensive for me to buy something?” My mother would use words like this to rebuke me, even in the face of my earnest attempts to dissuade her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, knowing clearly that there is a high probability that it is a trick of a liar, knowing clearly that there is no free lunch in the world, why do the elderly insist on &quot;traveling to the tiger mountain&quot; instead of believing in evil? This is mainly due to the fact that many elderly people have been in rural areas for a long time. They are kind-hearted and honest, and are prone to overflowing with sympathy. They do not understand the complexity of society enough, have limited knowledge of profiteers, have shallow knowledge, and lack basic anti-fraud awareness and skills. Businessmen They often take advantage of this fatal weakness of the elderly and succeed every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A grandfather who finally spent 800 yuan to buy ostrich milk said, &quot;You (young people) can&#39;t say that they are all liars. Hello, I have to say, I can&#39;t buy nothing, I can&#39;t be like this.&quot; Obviously, during the shopping process, the old man felt that it was not just a purely monetary transaction, but also included emotional feedback, that is, people If someone treats us well and takes good care of us, we should also &quot;treat others with courtesy&quot;. This &quot;courteous&quot; way is to buy other people&#39;s things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, why do the elderly not choose to consult their children outside for their opinions or suggestions? The author learned that during the few days of the sales meeting, many elderly people acted silently, went silently, bought silently, and returned silently. They would not take the initiative to inform their children outside of home about this situation. Of course, they were worried that their children would worry about them, or even Scold them. As old people, of course they care more about face. If they are scolded by their children, they will feel shameless. This is certainly not a situation they like to see. In fact, many elderly people are used to &quot;being independent&quot;. &quot;Don&#39;t interfere with what I do or what I buy. I&#39;m not old yet. I haven&#39;t reached the stage of Alzheimer&#39;s disease yet. I have my own judgment and ideas.&quot; , please mind your own business.&quot; This should be the true mentality of many elderly people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, another possibility is caused by the so-called &quot;disconnection&quot; phenomenon, that is, many children living outside have little contact with their parents on weekdays, and their care is relatively scarce, or even indifferent. When encountering this matter, they suddenly became &quot;doubly concerned&quot;. The old people would feel that the young people were &quot;hypocritical&quot; and &quot;too fake&quot;. Yesterday afternoon, one of my cousins ​​called his father several times at the sales venue to ask him not to buy any ostrich milk. Unexpectedly, his father got tired of hearing this and said angrily, &quot;It&#39;s not your money. I&#39;m willing to spend it. You don&#39;t have to pay for it.&quot; &quot;No matter what,&quot; then hung up the phone and turned off the phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, joining in the fun is actually quite scarce in many rural areas. My mother went to the market for six days in a row. I didn&#39;t understand it, but my father said it was okay. &quot;I have nothing to do anyway. It&#39;s okay to go and have some fun. It&#39;s fine if I don&#39;t buy anything.&quot; My father&#39;s &quot;strategy&quot; was not to let my mother bring cash or mobile phones, and then not allow her to borrow money from others. Every night on the phone, my mother was cheerful, talking about who she met yesterday and who she met today, whose daughter got married, whose son bought a house, and the steamed buns she served today tasted good. Obviously, my mother&#39;s mind is not on the sales meeting or the product. What she cares about is being able to see and chat with her friends every day. Yes, in today&#39;s rural areas, young people have gone to cities, children have gone to school, and even the elderly are not far apart from one village to another, but they are not close either. For a mother who is nearly seventy years old, there is nothing special. I won&#39;t go to neighboring villages to visit. On weekdays, she just wandered around the village and spent time with her father every day. You looked at me and I looked at you. Occasionally, they would have a few words, saying that her later life was very fulfilling and not boring at all. That was a lie. Obviously, she will be lonely, she will be lonely, she will have nothing to do, social interaction is her real need, and going to the sales club every day for a walk can make her extremely happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but think of when I was a child. At that time, there were often acrobatic troupes performing in the village, and occasionally people would come to the village to show movies. The scene was spectacular and lively. Times have changed, and in today&#39;s rural areas, many people have their doors locked all year round. The only permanent residents in the village are the elderly. Hollow villages or hollowed-out villages abound. Obviously, the permanent population has dropped sharply, and there are no or few public recreational activities, making the elderly even more lonely, which will inevitably seriously affect the quality of life of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, regarding the fact that rural elderly people are (easily) deceived, I think young people might as well be more free and easy-going, encourage them to visit and go shopping, and tell them to be more vigilant. However, there is a basic fact that it is difficult for us to say now or in advance that the things they buy are fake or counterfeit. This requires a period of testing to see the effects after trial or consumption. If in the end, they find that the items they purchased are indeed inferior products, and they have really been fooled, there is no need to be angry or angry with them, because they have finally gained something, such as meeting and chatting with old friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[山东莱荣高铁被举报偷工减料存在质量隐患，官方通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261300]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 19:51:12&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On July 20, the media reported that there were some threaded piles in the construction of the first three sections of the Lairong High-speed Railway Station. The pile length did not reach the designed pile length, and the design change procedures were not completed, resulting in quality hazards and other problems. The National Railway Administration, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government attached great importance to it and immediately established a joint investigation team composed of the Shanghai Railway Supervision and Administration Bureau and the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation to conduct investigations in accordance with laws and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The joint investigation team dispatched more than 120 professionals from across the country to conduct on-site investigations, and organized 10 experts in railway, geology and other fields to provide technical guidance. It lasted more than two months, carried out geological exploration and drilling inspection, interviewed 14 relevant units and 83 people, reviewed more than 29,000 pieces of data in 130 categories, and formed an investigation report and more than 100,000 words of investigation supporting materials. After the investigation was completed, seven experts, including academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, were invited to demonstrate the investigation and conclusions. The joint investigation team verified the issues reported by the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the problem that the pile length of some threaded piles constructed by Sanjie Company did not reach the designed pile length. The joint investigation team entrusted a testing agency to carry out drilling and sampling tests on the threaded piles subcontracted by China Construction Eighth Engineering Group Co., Ltd. to Sanjie Company and other units for construction in accordance with relevant specifications, and simultaneously carried out infill geological exploration; it entrusted a professional agency to supervise the whole process and conduct inspections on the quality and safety of the roadbed foundation. Comprehensive Evaluation. Through the infill geological survey of the subgrade base constructed by Sanjie Company, it is shown that the thickness of the granite weathering layer and the fluctuation of the weathering layer interface in this section vary greatly. After on-site inspection and comprehensive analysis and evaluation, the construction pile length of the threaded piles in this subgrade section is consistent with the height and low fluctuations of the bearing layer revealed by the infill geological survey, and the &quot;unable to drive&quot; phenomenon has occurred. The construction pile lengths of some threaded piles have not reached the design pile length. , but the threaded pile pile end has entered a better bearing layer, which does not affect the quality and safety of the composite foundation. No corners-cutting was found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the issue of failure to perform design change procedures. After investigation, when the threaded pile construction did not reach the designed pile length but the pile end entered the bearing layer, the participating units only met on site to confirm and failed to perform design change procedures in accordance with regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After comprehensive investigation and evaluation, the bearing capacity of the composite foundation in the subgrade section as reported by the media meets the engineering requirements, and the stability and post-construction settlement meet the requirements of relevant railway specifications. There are no composite foundation quality problems or safety hazards. It does not affect the safety of railway operations. At the same time, the settlement deformation was observed and evaluated after the completion of the composite foundation. The results showed that the actual measured and evaluated post-construction settlement of the entire Lai-Rong High-speed Railway line met the specification requirements. The acceptance results of the joint debugging and joint testing of the Lai-Rong High-speed Railway and other acceptance results show that the Lai-Rong High-speed Railway meets the track smoothness requirements during the operation of 350km/h high-speed railway and meets the safety and stability requirements of high-speed train operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investigation found that during the construction period, Sanjie Company and China Construction Eighth Engineering Bureau had conflicts in terms of construction progress and project payment. They had withdrawn from the construction in June 2021, and the two parties have not reached an agreement on resolving the disputes. . The investigation also found that there were problems in construction management such as inadequate on-site management and irregular project subcontracting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the investigation conclusion, in response to existing problems in design changes, construction management, project subcontracting, etc., the Shanghai Railway Supervision and Administration Bureau imposed administrative penalties on the relevant responsible units and 7 responsible persons in accordance with the law; in accordance with relevant regulations, The construction unit China Construction Eighth Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd., the supervision unit China Railway Second Institute (Chengdu) Consulting Supervision Co., Ltd., the design unit China Railway Fourth Survey and Design Institute Group Co., Ltd. and the construction unit Shandong Lairong High-speed Railway Co., Ltd.
