Since the beginning of the 1990s, I have been thinking about a question: In a modern society, what can traditional culture still do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Reform and opening up brought a &quot;cultural craze&quot; to the ideological circles at that time. Chen Lai remembers that the most popular one was the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Towards the Future&quot; series at the time. Bao Zunxin said, &quot;When he went to Peking University and said a word, the crowd applauded.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The school of thought, represented by Bao Zunxin and others, believes that Confucianism is incompatible with modern spirit, which has caused the decline of society, the ignorance of the public and the country&#39;s decline in modern times. Being poor and weak needs to be reviewed or even abandoned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the beginning, Chen Lai was just a bystander of the &quot;cultural craze&quot;. He is the first independently trained doctor of philosophy in New China. In the autumn of 1977, Chinese colleges and universities resumed postgraduate enrollment, and Chen Lai read the news in the newspaper. A week later, he went from his workplace in the eastern suburbs of Beijing to register at Peking University in the western suburbs of Beijing, and finally chose the Chinese philosophy major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Philosophy is the traditional strength major of Peking University. After the major restructuring of departments in 1952, all philosophy teachers from universities across the country gathered at Peking University. In the following years, the Department of Philosophy at Peking University was the only philosophy department in the country. A large number of outstanding scholars such as Tang Yongtong, Feng Youlan, Jin Yuelin, Zhu Guangqian, Zhang Dainian, Ren Jiyu, etc. gathered in Yanyuan, which can be called the &quot;Jixia Academy of the 20th century&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the resumption of enrollment in the late 1970s, the Chinese Philosophy Teaching and Research Office, where Zhang Dainian was the director, enrolled the first 10 graduate students, and Chen Lai was one of them. Chen Lai recalled that more than 200 people applied for the History of Chinese Philosophy exam at Peking University this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the context of Western modernization thoughts constantly attacking the Chinese cultural world, Chen Lai returned to Chinese tradition and completed his doctoral thesis &quot;Study on the Philosophy of Zhu Xi&quot; in 1985 , made a detailed and detailed investigation of Zhu Xi&#39;s philosophical thoughts and development. Soon after, he visited Harvard University for two years. After noticing the &quot;cultural craze&quot; in China and the ubiquitous Christian tradition in the United States, he began to think about the relationship between traditional culture and modern society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, in the &quot;cultural craze&quot; in China, an important issue was how to promote cultural modernization, and how to treat traditional Confucianism and traditional culture was the focus of debate. The opinions of Bao Zunxin and others once prevailed. When many scholars were &quot;cutting their ties&quot; with Confucianism, Chen Lai&#39;s voice seemed out of place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1987, at the &quot;China in the New Era&quot; international symposium held in Manila, Philippines, Chen Lai submitted a paper &quot;Review and Prospect of Modern Chinese Thought&quot;, It opposes the complete eradication of traditional culture, including Confucianism, advocates the protection of traditional culture, holds a cultural conservatism stance, and boldly makes the judgment that &quot;the greatest condition for the revival of traditional thought is modernization.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In February of the following year, at the International Symposium on &quot;Issues and Prospects of the Development of Confucianism&quot; held in Singapore, in response to the views of Bao Zunxin and others, Chen In response, he submitted a paper &quot;Confucianism and its Positioning in a Multicultural Structure&quot;. He talked about the spread of money worship, utilitarianism, opportunism and undisguised greed in society, and the young generation was at a loss in an atmosphere of emptiness. Siblings. It is precisely in this utilitarian trend and value rupture that the value rationality of Confucianism can provide a set of ethical values ​​and a humanistic worldview that are compatible with modernization reforms and guide the spiritual direction of contemporary Chinese people. He pointed out that modern society is a multicultural society, in which Confucianism does not propose specific designs for reform, but rather proposes a humanistic worldview that complements reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To this day, China&#39;s ideological circles are still digesting the legacy of the &quot;cultural craze&quot; many years ago. The direction of history is as he judged, and the craze for traditional culture continues to this day. Chen Lai is worried: &quot;In every era and every activity, when someone advocates it, some people will excessively push these things to extremes. This is worthy of vigilance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Mr. Zhang For classes, read Mr. Feng’s book”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After the degree system was restored, You applied for a graduate degree in the Philosophy Department of Peking University and later became the first independently trained doctor of philosophy in New China. Can you talk about your educational experience? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am the first batch of graduate students after the reform and opening up. In October 1977, the country officially announced that it would recruit college students through the college entrance examination. A month later, &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; published another news, which was to resume the postgraduate enrollment system. At the time of admission, because there was no official document stating the nature of the postgraduate degree, we all thought that this postgraduate degree was equivalent to the Soviet associate doctoral degree. Associate doctoral students were recruited from universities in the 1950s after the country learned from the Soviet Union&#39;s experience. They are equivalent to doctoral students in the West, because in the Soviet Union, there were full doctorates on top of associate doctoral degrees, and they almost required professors. At that time, the personnel treatment for returning to China after obtaining an associate doctoral degree in the Soviet Union was equivalent to that for those who obtained a doctoral degree in Western countries. However, by 1957, this system was abolished, and associate doctorates were no longer recruited. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;When we entered school, we also thought it was based on the associate doctorate. Everyone has higher expectations for themselves, and they are all based on the standard of a doctorate. Asked by myself. It wasn’t until the second semester of the second year of graduate school that the country introduced a new system, saying that our first batch of graduate students were master’s students, which was not equivalent to associate doctorate students in the Soviet Union, but was one level lower than doctorate students in the United States. At that time, everyone still Not so satisfied. But we are disappointed. In terms of professional attainments, our first batch of graduate students strived to reach the Soviet Union&#39;s associate doctorate level at the master&#39;s level, which is close to the level of American doctorates. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;What was the opportunity to continue studying for a PhD? What were the criteria for awarding doctorates at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduating from graduate school in the fall of 1981, I stayed at Peking University to teach. The next year, the school announced the list of the first batch of doctoral supervisors. With the doctoral supervisors, it was stated that they would continue to award doctorates. I also decided to give it a try. Later, I was changed from a teacher to a doctoral candidate, and my original salary was paid as usual. There was nothing special about it. In addition to English writing and speaking courses, I basically focus on writing my doctoral thesis. At that time there were no clear criteria for awarding degrees. Now when you are studying for a Ph.D., you will have clear requirements for being awarded a Ph.D. after being admitted. For example, Tsinghua University School of Humanities stipulates that the number of words for a doctoral thesis should be between 150,000 and 200,000 words. We didn&#39;t establish it in this way when we were in school, so we relied on our own imagination. Referring to the requirements of the Soviet Union&#39;s associate doctorate, we probably had to write about 200,000 words. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;What do you think are the characteristics of the education you received at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The education we received is different from that of Chinese students in the 1950s and 1960s. Likewise, previous education was severely disrupted and academically weak. Speaking of my major in Chinese philosophy, there were two old gentlemen at that time, one was Mr. Feng Youlan and the other was Mr. Zhang Dainian. Mr. Zhang gave us two courses: Historical Materials of the History of Chinese Philosophy and Methodology of the History of Chinese Philosophy. Mr. Feng stopped taking classes because he was older. Once upon a time, a reporter summarized my words and said that the characteristic of our postgraduate studies was &quot;taking Mr. Zhang&#39;s class and reading Mr. Feng&#39;s books.&quot; Mr. Feng and Mr. Zhang were already leading scholars in our discipline in the 1930s, so the professional education we received was directly connected to the academic and educational traditions of the 1930s and 1940s, while those students in the 1950s received It was an education influenced by Soviet experts. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;What role did these two gentlemen play in your life? What learning methods did you learn from them? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Zhang is my mentor, from scratch to PhD degree , Mr. Zhang’s academic thoughts and academic methods had a great influence on me. He specifically guided me from the primary stage of learning to the advanced stage. After graduation, I worked as an assistant to Mr. Feng, mainly helping him compile the &quot;New History of Chinese Philosophy&quot;. I took the initiative to learn from Mr. Feng through conversations, how to learn from him and how to think philosophically. Unlike Mr. Zhang, Mr. Feng helped me rise to a higher level after I had already reached a relatively advanced stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Mr. Zhang&#39;s academic method can be said in one sentence to be &quot;easy to learn and think deeply, and know what he means.&quot; The original words of this sentence come from Sima Qian&#39;s &quot;Historical Records&quot;: &quot;If you don&#39;t love to learn and think deeply, and know its meaning in your heart, you will be short-sighted and ignorant.&quot; Mr. Zhang extracted the eight words &quot;Love to learn and think deeply, and know its meaning in your heart&quot; to emphasize research. When studying the history of Chinese philosophy, on the one hand, we must conduct an in-depth and detailed interpretation of the literature to grasp its original meaning; on the other hand, we must use a clear logical analysis method to explain it layer by layer, and we must not swallow it in a hurry or explain it vaguely. Confused, this clear logical analysis method was called &quot;analyzing names and analyzing principles&quot; in ancient China. This is the fundamental method and attitude for studying and researching the history of Chinese philosophy. It can also be said to be the basic method I learned from Mr. Zhang. My doctoral thesis &quot;Study on Zhu Xi&#39;s Philosophy&quot; is to study Zhu Xi&#39;s philosophy using the method of &quot;love to learn and think deeply, and know the meaning from the heart&quot;, which fully reflects Mr. Zhang&#39;s influence on me. Mr. Feng has been a philosopher for a long time, and his research focuses on thinking about the realm of life in philosophy. Later I published another book called &quot;The Realm of Being and Absence&quot;. This &quot;realm&quot; is the &quot;realm&quot; of &quot;realm&quot;. When I was studying Wang Yangming, I put the issue of realm at the center. This was also inspired by Mr. Feng&#39;s The influence of realm emphasis. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As a teacher now, what methods do you teach your students? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Now I ask students to still emphasize Mr. Zhang’s method, because Mr. Zhang’s method helps students move from the primary stage to the advanced stage. The only way is to lay the foundation, and Mr. Feng’s method is a higher-level choice. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73441&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70250&quot; src= &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/8a9509b256.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;VCG111388227602.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;June 19, 2022, parents with their children Visiting the Confucius Museum in Qufu City, Shandong Province.

In your 1987 article &quot;Review and Prospect of Modern Chinese Thought&quot;, you made &quot; &quot;The greatest condition for the revival of traditional thought is modernization&quot;, holding a cultural conservatism stance and opposing the complete eradication of tradition. Why did you choose this stance at that time? Has this position been established since your research on Zhu Xi? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The relationship between tradition and modernity was the most heated discussion in academic circles in the 1980s Regarding the issue, I started doing research on Zhu Xi in 1979, and when I completed it in 1985, I still didn’t have such a position. It wasn’t until 1986 that I visited Harvard University in the United States and observed that Christian traditions are ubiquitous in modern society in the United States. This made me think about the relationship between tradition and modernity, and whether we must completely oppose tradition. Only by completely breaking away from tradition like the New Culture Movement can we move towards modernization. Some people at that time believed that tradition was feudalism and that we must be more resolute in our anti-feudalism in order to move toward openness and modernity. I wrote some articles at that time, firmly opposing the complete eradication of tradition, and I was still writing articles on this stance until the 1990s. This is parallel to my academic research. On the one hand, I have relatively pure academic research, and on the other hand, I continue to participate in discussions of social and cultural trends of thought. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It should be said that I have two positions, one is cultural conservatism, and the other is cultural openness. I would like to emphasize cultural conservatism. American sociologist Daniel Bell once said that cultural conservatism is mainly aimed at the cultural tendency of over-commercialization in modern society, emphasizing authority and cultural value in culture, and focusing on protecting the value of traditional culture. . However, since the mid-1990s, some dogmatists have stigmatized cultural conservatism, calling it extreme retroism and conservatism. This is wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;mentioned at that time that &quot; Is &quot;conservative&quot; a bit sensitive? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The concept of &quot;conservatism&quot; does not seem to mean much in modern China. Very positive, but in Western concepts, &quot;conservative&quot; is not necessarily a bad word, but can reflect positive values. Cultural conservatism is a cultural attitude that values ​​the culture that humans have created and inherited throughout history. I emphasized from the beginning that cultural conservatism is not political conservatism and has nothing to do with politics. However, when some people hear cultural conservatism, they think it is against reform and opening up. In fact, this is not what it really means. It is about culture. value. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;You mentioned in the Qizhi interview that you suffered attacks from some scholars because of your insistence on Chinese culture in the late 1980s. For example, you mentioned that in those years, your important academic works also won awards in various awards. Only the third prize can be awarded. With the development of the times, your position has gradually been recognized and realized. Have you personally experienced the process of moving from the edge to the center? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The description from edge to center is not appropriate and I was shocked. At that time, I was not on the edge. Now that I am not affected by it, I cannot be said to be in the center. These blows only affected my personal situation and did not affect my own academic development and progress. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;You have always been firm in your stance. Many people may have stopped speaking out after being hit. Why are you so persistent? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because what I said is right, on the contrary, those things that hit me I find their behavior very despicable, but I don’t care that much. I will do my own thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In recent years, traditional culture has become more and more popular among young people In your opinion, what changes have occurred in the “traditional culture craze” in China? Which of these are exciting, and which are cause for alarm? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I can intuitively feel that young people are becoming more and more interested in elements of traditional culture. Interests, like wearing Hanfu, etc. In principle, it is gratifying to absorb the elements of traditional culture and adopt them in today&#39;s cultural forms. For example, many of the cultural and creative products in various places are related to local cultural traditions or Chinese cultural traditions. . &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for what we need to be vigilant about, in abstract terms, it is the promotion of traditional culture, which should be more natural and should not be blunt or rigid. Excessive promotion away from natural needs. For example, in the past few years, there were many classic reading classes for children, which required children to memorize hundreds of thousands or even 200,000 words. I think this is unnecessary. When children learn traditional culture, it becomes their values ​​in life, and it doesn’t matter how much they memorize. In every era and every activity, when someone advocates it, there will be people who push these things to extremes. This is something to be wary of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73442&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70251&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c856153e2f.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;VCG111457714756.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;October 4, 2023, Nanjing, Tourists wearing Hanfu visit the Laomendong Scenic Area.

Confucius founded Confucianism. Disciples continued to pass it on, but because it was in the Warring States Period, the ruling class at that time was particularly interested in military doctrine, that is, how to develop the military. They had a more positive attitude towards the Legalist thoughts of the pre-Qin era and felt that Legalist methods could be effective immediately. They were very interested in Confucianism. No interest. In the Han Dynasty, a unified country based on the system of prefectures and counties was formed. The ruling class deeply reflected on the rapid demise of the Qin Dynasty. At first, they wanted to replace Legalism with Taoism, but they soon found that the Taoist attitude was only suitable for There was no active governance strategy for the restoration of the economic ecology after the war, so Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty decided to only respect Confucianism and regard Confucianism as the leading value. The following dynasties did not change much. They all used Confucian values ​​​​to implement state governance. Of course, they were not just Confucianists, but also absorbed Taoist and Legalist ideas. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In modern times, Western learning based on the Scientific Revolution and the Industrial Revolution entered China. The society was in a period of transformation, and the traditional society was going to Modern society based on the scientific revolution and technological revolution has some different attitudes towards traditional culture and traditional thoughts during this period. The most important one is total westernization, which takes a negative stance towards traditional Chinese culture including Confucianism. At the same time, there are also some The other type, with a relatively small number of people, adheres to Confucianism and traditional culture and has its positive significance - although the social foundation has changed, as a result of wisdom gained from historical human exploration of nature, society, life, including literature and art, Traditional culture and Confucianism are not meaningless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can it be understood as Are the values ​​advocated by Confucianism particularly important to social reform and transformation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s not just values, of course values ​​are included. The &quot;Review and Prospects of Modern Chinese Thought&quot; I wrote in 1987 was aimed at the reform issues at that time. At that time, some theorists actually put forward the slogan &quot;Everything depends on money.&quot; I emphasized at that time that &quot;all things are about money&quot; would never become the spiritual tradition of a great nation. The role of Confucianism in the process of modernization and reform is not to propose specific designs for reform, but to propose a humanistic worldview that complements reform. The task or function of Confucianism is not to directly promote reforms, but to provide a humanistic spirit that complements modernization reforms to guide people&#39;s general spiritual direction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Confucianism does not have to be directly related to the social transformation of Westernization. Social modernization can occur while basic values ​​remain unchanged. of. For example, Japan&#39;s basic cultural values ​​did not change much from 1880 until its economic redevelopment in the 1960s. No region with a Confucian culture in Asia achieved modernization without first overthrowing Confucian culture. The success of modernization in regions and countries such as Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore has proven that societies that have grown up under the influence of Chinese culture can achieve modernization well. In a developed modern market economy, the general trend of commercialization makes the requirements of this society&#39;s moral norms and spiritual civilization more prominent than before. In the era of big pot rice, this problem is not prominent. Therefore, the value and significance of Confucian modernization are not just viewed from the coordinates of utilitarianism. The most important thing is that in an era when commercialization is prevalent, market economy and utilitarianism require a value system to constrain and regulate society as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now in the general sense From what angle do you consider the revival of Confucianism? Are there political factors? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;To a large extent, it comes from philosophy or culture. Think about it, not politically. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The revival of Confucianism in the general sense began during the May Fourth Movement. Liang Shuming and Xiong Shili both wanted to inherit Confucianism philosophically. Tradition developed the New Confucianism of this era; culturally speaking, when we talk about the decline of Confucianism, it is mainly at the level of secular social culture, including the integrated forms of existence such as socialization, institutionalization, and secularization, including some aspects of all aspects of society. Basic institutions and some basic culture. Private schools, academies, etc. did not exist in the 1990s, but today there are already many. In fact, there is no shortage of metaphysical constructions of Confucian philosophy in the 20th century. The most important thing now is how to restore Confucianism as a life ethic to influence the public and society. Of course, it is impossible to completely restore, but it can be partially or improvedly restored. For example, the restoration of ancestral halls, academies, and private schools has its own positive significance today. The moral decline and value loss in society in recent years is not due to the lack of a few philosophers, but the lack of the cultural foundation of Confucianism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In your opinion , Who should be responsible for the revival of Confucianism as a culture? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is not a single person, it can be a group, or it can be Social organizations, for example, many civil servants with various professions are now involved in the revival of Confucianism, including how to promote Confucianism into schools, villages, communities, and folk culture so that it can play a role in this era , there are many social forces doing this work now. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, I was in Shandong in September and went to Qufu Sage Education School. The philosophy of their two principals was to use Confucian concepts to Guiding education does not mean learning all the content, but using Confucianism to guide. Whether in primary school or middle school, the first class for students every day is to study Confucian classics, as well as some activities similar to meditation to help students become more stable and calm down for learning. It is easy for students to accept it, and parents also feel that students in this school are not impetuous and are relatively quiet. I think it is very effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to the power of the people , should the government promote it? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The government does not specifically use Confucianism as a guiding ideology for education. Instead, it is collectively referred to as Chinese cultural education. How are these policies implemented in the national education system? Courses require hours of study. It is useless to say that there are no hours of study. How are teachers trained? This is what the Ministry of Education can do. It is not difficult to provide teaching hours, develop teaching materials, and have trained teachers teach. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are in the book &quot;Watching the Value of Tradition&quot; When it comes to shaping the spiritual temperament of Chinese people, the most important thing is through education.

Primary school curriculum education is one aspect. Our emphasis on traditional culture in the past ten years has been more conducive to the creative transformation and innovative development of traditional Chinese culture in terms of educational environment. But this work also needs to be recognized by the entire society. From government leaders, institutional regulations and systems to grassroots school teachers, all must persist in order to do it well. This consensus is much better now than before, and we should be optimistic about rebuilding our cultural and educational system. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you have the ultimate idea about social value rules?

Confucianism has still become one of the sources of value for Chinese people, providing Chinese people with the principles of life, the meaning of life, principles and norms for dealing with the world, and even the basic attitude towards the universe, nature, society and human destiny. Today, our cultural structure is not like the single structure of traditional society. It must be a pluralistic structure. Confucianism is not intended to be an ideology, but to have a leading influence on the people as a cultural temperament and spiritual temperament. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Young people lie flat and need neither attention nor criticism&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From the perspective of students, young people nowadays are more willing to study economics and management, and it seems that they will not choose philosophy.

Do you agree with this statement? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In every era, only a few people choose philosophy, and philosophy has always been It is not a popular knowledge, but a niche cultural field, but it plays a great role. Today&#39;s society is more utilitarian, so fewer people will choose it. This is a fact, but I think it doesn&#39;t matter, because it is pursued by a small number of people. But in terms of opportunities, the status of the Chinese nation in the world today is different. We who engage in philosophy are also more relaxed. We are not as squeezed by Western culture as before. What we are thinking about now is how to understand what we have learned over the years. The Western things are combined with our traditional things to form a new philosophical thinking. Therefore, it is an opportune time to study philosophy in today’s era. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;In addition to professional choices, when it comes to career choices, many young people also choose to &quot;lay down&quot; or become &quot;full-time children&quot;. Doesn&#39;t it seem to be in line with the &quot;hard work and enterprising&quot; in our traditional culture? What do you think? &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think these situations are surprising and I don’t need to pay attention to them. , no need to criticize. What we want to see is the diversity of employment, and everyone should have a variety of choices. As for choosing to live alone and stay full-time, one reason is that society has created conditions that allow children to live peacefully and have a guaranteed life. In fact, having children who live alone and work full time is not only inconsistent with the concepts in traditional culture, but also in line with the concepts of modern society. However, on the one hand, we cannot easily condemn those who care about their personal destiny. On the other hand, we must also encourage young people with strong idealism and willingness to take responsibility to pursue greater goals. For example, some students should be encouraged to teach wherever they are willing to go after graduation. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Now that school has started, what do you want to say to college students? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Lai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think there is anything to worry about in professional studies. We still need to correctly establish three views, which have an important impact on life. From a small perspective, it is beneficial to personal mental health. Nowadays, many college students are mentally unhealthy. From a large perspective, it is to further develop social responsibilities and so on. In junior high school and high school, there were guidance from class teachers and parents. After reaching university, I think every college student still needs to pay attention to how to control the construction of his own three views. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公安部就《电信网络诈骗及其关联违法犯罪联合惩戒办法（征求意见稿）》 面向社会公开征求意见]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260499]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 11:14:22&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In order to thoroughly implement the &quot;Anti-Telecommunications Network Fraud Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, the Ministry of Public Security, together with relevant competent authorities, recently The &quot;Joint Punishment Measures for Telecommunications Network Fraud and Related Illegal Crimes (Draft for Comments)&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Punishment Measures (Draft for Comments)&quot;) was drafted and widely solicited opinions from the society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Punishment Measures (Draft for Comments)&quot; has a total of 19 articles, which mainly include six aspects: disciplinary principles, disciplinary objects, disciplinary measures, graded punishment, disciplinary procedures, and complaint verification.

As this drama Director and screenwriter Chen Huiling has entered the audience&#39;s field of vision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Huiling grew up &quot;free-range&quot; and knew what her interests were early on. In the composition class in the first grade of middle school, she wrote a thick book because she wanted to express too many things. The teacher revised it very carefully and encouraged her to continue writing. This planted a seed in the heart of 13-year-old Chen Huiling - &quot;Ah, I can write. Then I will continue to write.&quot; In this way, Chen Huiling began to create her artistic world bit by bit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, when she first debuted in 2008, she won the Drama Program Director Award at the 43rd Taiwan Television Golden Bell Awards for her first drama work &quot;The Golden Thread&quot;. In the same year, his work &quot;Secret Conversations with My Boyfriend&#39;s Ex-Girlfriend&quot; won the Golden Bell Award for Miniseries Screenwriting and Editing. Therefore, &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; is more like an opportunity for Chen Huiling to push her works to a more popular stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She always focuses on the subtle emotional exchanges between people. In the following three years, she created &quot;That Year, It Rained Never Stopped&quot;, which won the Drama Program Director Award at the 45th Taiwan TV Golden Bell Awards, the romantic drama &quot;The Money Worship Queen&quot;, and the feature film &quot;Moonlight in Jilin&quot; and other works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, Chen Huiling was diagnosed with cervical cancer. In the following 10 years, the disease recurred many times. The joke of fate did not stop her from creating and enjoying life: as soon as she finished her treatment, she would travel abroad while she was still in good condition. In 2016, she directed the unit drama &quot;Rolling Stone Love Story&quot;. In 2019, she starred in &quot;Your Child&quot; &quot;Not Your Child&quot; won the Golden Bell Award for Best Director again. In the interview, she mentioned her thoughts on the relationship between parents and children in the Chinese world - &quot;A baby will cry when it is hungry, but a teenager who longs for love cannot cry or scream? Our generation has already (in such an atmosphere) (Part 2) After finally growing up, do we still treat our children like this?&quot; In February 2023, she also went to Turkey to participate in the earthquake relief work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Chen Huiling, who has always shown an optimistic outlook, had not shared her anti-cancer journey on Facebook, we would not have imagined that the disease would have caused her so much suffering. &quot;The physical condition is not something you can control. Those who can maintain mindfulness, take deep breaths, and meditate when the pain makes you roll on the bed are capable people. I am just a mortal.&quot; Even so, she will still be troubled by the growth of her shaved hair. I felt happy because my blood test was normal and I had my eyebrows bleached. I was happy because I heard the teacher talk about her favorite Szymborska in the writing class. Illness can take away a healthy body, but it cannot take away the ability to perceive and convey happiness. She said, &quot;It would be good to move forward a little bit more each day. Even if it doesn&#39;t, it would be good.

The final moments were surrounded by family and friends. The splendid life did not want to be trapped in a small box, so she chose to be buried in a tree and return to the earth, which can accommodate all free souls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months before her death, Chen Huiling wrote on her Facebook, &quot;How precious life is, how lovely life is, life is not for complaining, life is for living well.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank &quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt; /a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[常州通报“企业家约谈后坠楼身亡”事件：正核查案件办理情况]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260490]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 09:54:52&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, it has been reported online that Changzhou Holley Chairman Cheng Yong fell to his death after being interviewed, which has attracted public attention .

Zhan Danian discovered that the rate of depression among students has increased in recent years and was determined to help them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, he hopes to use the forum to arouse more people&#39;s attention to the phenomenon of teenage depression. A month ago, I heard Zhan Danian talk about this topic for the first time on the phone. I admired this middle-aged educator for his sense of social responsibility - but also secretly thought: a private school aimed at helping &quot;problem students&quot; , do you have enough professionalism and experience to share (on dealing with student depression)? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three or four days I went to Yiliang, my doubts were solved bit by bit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on the day we arrived at the school, a small book-sized window at the gate was opened, revealing the smiling faces of several children: Auntie, we will ask someone to open the door for you. After entering the door, Zhan Danian was standing by the playground. When they saw me, they started introducing me directly from the teaching building. When he walked into the psychology room, several children greeted him with a smile, &quot;Zhan Zhan, do you still remember me?&quot; In the painting room inside, two boys were quietly drawing mandalas without raising their heads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During those days of &quot;ugly duckling&quot;, students were all at ease wherever they went. Except for military training and physical education classes, which require gathering on time, at other times, these children cannot see the tension of being disciplined, the exhaustion after excessive homework, and social numbness. It was the &quot;Class Culture Week&quot; and there were many children drawing in the stairwells and dormitories during class. During the interview, looking at their relaxed expressions as they chatted easily, and greedily taking a few deep breaths of the warm air on the mountain, I really felt: This is a normal campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you get closer to these children, you will find that many of them are &quot;ridden with holes.&quot; A colleague read the manuscript and said, &quot;Today&#39;s children, aged fourteen or fifteen, have so many things on their minds...&quot; In fact, every child has an interesting soul. &quot;Things on the Heart&quot; are related to their tortuous experiences and are also their normal reactions to this weird world. It would be strange if all the excitement, curiosity, and attempts are constantly broken, misinterpreted, and &quot;formatted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to my doubts at the beginning of the interview. Xu Kaiwen, a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Peking University, followed up on 10 families who lost their only child during the fifth anniversary of the Wenchuan earthquake. He found that families that recovered well from the trauma had “improved living conditions and localized emotional regulation, like playing mahjong. This kind of down-to-earth social support system may be more effective than psychological counseling.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is no different for teenagers. In addition to children with symptoms of severe depression who should be treated through medical means, most teenagers need nothing more than understanding and listening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plenty of sunshine, regular physical exercise, teaching that is not aimed at cramming or exam-taking, time for daze, opportunities to express without fear, and equality between teachers and students. Whether it&#39;s a teacher, a classmate or a parent, there is always someone who understands you. When you feel down, use him as your tree hole or &quot;handrail&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These should be the growth atmosphere that every school-age child and teenager has the right to enjoy. Now it has become a luxury and even consensus cannot be reached. Rather than visiting the Ugly Duckling Middle School in search of a cure for children’s depression, it would be better to see how a shielded educational common sense is put into practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before publishing this article, Zhan Danian received another WeChat message from the parent of a first-year high school student. The latter told him that another student in his child’s school chose to leave in a decisive way. &quot;As parents, we are all frightened.&quot; This parent&#39;s child was also diagnosed with severe depression through a scale when he was in seventh grade. The child&#39;s parents have been committed to changing their relationship with their child. The family atmosphere is very good now. &quot;But we are in a county, and we are very scared when such a situation occurs. How should we accompany our children?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, they are not alone. After the forum, in addition to the WeChat group of 500 participants who continued to share various mutual aid information, a new WeChat group was added, and everyone discussed establishing an alliance to prevent and treat youth depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“要寻找技术和方法，希望群体越来越好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[马伯庸回应拒签盗版书：精神产品生产者的声誉有多重要？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260486]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-13 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some netizens posted that they saw this scene at the Nanjing offline meeting of writer Ma Boyong: An uncle asked a writer to sign a book, but &quot;he was scolded by the staff&quot; that the book was pirated. &quot;Anyone with a discerning eye could see his embarrassment.&quot; This netizen believed that the staff were &quot;arrogant&quot; and that the writer &quot;didn&#39;t do anything to support the staff&quot;, &quot;made me feel like I was about to lose the house&quot;, &quot;very disappointed&quot; and &quot;held hundreds of book signings a year&quot; In a writer I see only his substance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen expressed the battle between reason and emotion. On the one hand: understanding that genuine editions protect the rights of writers. On the other hand, he said: Just like Teacher Yu Hua said, &quot;My books should be pirated.&quot; He is not supporting piracy, but he really hopes that at that moment he can stand up to protect a reader&#39;s love for him; the more he thinks about it, the more sad he becomes. , the more I admire Teacher Yu Hua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Ma Boyong himself responded: I really can’t sign pirated books. After all, I haven’t reached the level of Teacher Yu Hua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident is undoubtedly a storm in a tea cup, but there is indeed something to interpret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is normal for different writers to have different views on their books being pirated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The occurrence of piracy is often a reflection of &quot;book sales&quot; and &quot;popular works&quot;. In this sense, piracy is a writer&#39;s medal. It can even be said: How can one be called a &quot;writer&quot; if he has never been pirated? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, writer Yu Hua’s words are contextual and cannot be understood as support and endorsement of piracy. He said this on at least two public occasions. Once he said: &quot;I never fight against piracy. There is mainly such a poor consumer group. They also want to read, so they buy a few cheap pirated books... If this problem is not solved, my books will be pirated. It should be&quot;; another said: &quot;It is right that my book should be pirated, because at least it is better than food safety. You solve the food safety problem and then solve the piracy problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time Yu Hua said this, the focus was not on piracy, but on a specific social issue. The first time was &quot;poor consumer groups&quot; and the second time was &quot;food safety.&quot; In fact, if the losses caused by piracy are not huge but the cost of settlement is high, expressing your attitude and gaining reputation in this way is also the right choice. After all, a good reputation is a very important asset for a producer of spiritual products. Moreover, he believes that the &quot;piracy problem&quot; needs to be solved, and does not believe that &quot;piracy is justified&quot; or &quot;piracy is justified.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s understandable even if the author himself hates his books being pirated. Pirated copies are far cheaper than genuine copies. On the one hand, this allows people who cannot afford genuine copies to afford them and satisfy their intellectual and spiritual needs. On the other hand, it also makes some readers who would otherwise buy genuine copies buy pirated copies instead. Piracy with typos has long been a thing of the past. Today’s authentic photocopies, electronic versions, or electronic print versions have almost no difference in reading experience from the original version. This will affect the sales of the original version and harm the interests of publishers and authors. There are even some sales channels that mix genuine copies with pirated copies, and the latter is more profitable. Many readers spend the price of genuine copies to buy pirated copies. This is essentially a form of fraud, and it also infringes upon those who were kept in the dark. Reader Rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, on this basis, how to clarify the right and wrong of this incident? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For an extremely successful best-selling author like Ma Boyong, he has no problem with being averse to piracy. In his response, he said that he felt sorry for the readers who unknowingly bought pirated copies. In the past, he would spend his own money to buy more than a dozen books to keep. If he found out that the readers had pirated copies, he would give them a genuine copy, but later the pirated copies were really It is so rampant that sometimes nearly 1/3 of the books brought by authors on site are pirated copies. It was embarrassing and burdensome, so I changed the method and set up on-site genuine sales. Readers who accidentally bought a pirated copy can buy a new one. &quot;You don&#39;t have to queue up again, just come to me to sign it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Readers who spend time and money to get autographs from authors should do so because they particularly like the author and his works, and generally do not intentionally buy pirated books. Therefore, most of the readers who brought pirated books thought they were cheated by the channels and bought pirated copies with genuine money. Therefore, both arrangements before and after are decent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the on-site staff really &quot;scolded&quot; the uncle who signed the pirated book, then the only thing worth improving is the attitude issue. This type of signing event is usually organized by publishing houses. It is possible that the staff of the publishing house will be angry when they see such a high proportion of pirated books and the interests of the publishing house being infringed upon. In this sense, even if Ma Boyong is particularly generous, it is inappropriate to accept pirated books and sign them all, because this is generosity to others and detrimental to the interests of the publishing house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, how do you view writers as producers of spiritual products and their pursuit of material interests? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A gentleman loves money and gets it in a wise way. In theory, this principle applies to any profession, but producers of spiritual products are indeed very different from producers of material products, and reputation and reputation are much more important. Readers as consumers have two special psychological expectations for the former. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, especially for an author who is a spiritual mentor, readers will expect him to conform to the image of a wise man or a saint: the best image is to be immortal, with a transcendent and elegant air, and in moral terms You are a lot higher than the world, at least you can&#39;t show your love for money or greed for material benefits, because if you are as &quot;tacky&quot; as me, what else do you have that I can admire and look up to? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Boyong’s response obviously understood the reader’s psychology. He did not explain why he disliked piracy, nor did he clarify whether there was any “scolding”. He only said that “it is inevitable to be negligent in doing things, and there will always be mistakes.” A satisfactory place&quot;, and spend a lot of space on empathizing with the reader, telling how he enjoys the interaction with the reader, &quot;treating the reader as a friend&quot;, and demonstrating that he is not materialistic. This is an effective way to protect his reputation. Act of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, for producers of spiritual products, readers will expect their behavior to be consistent with the values ​​expressed in books or in public. If a writer promotes a high moral standard or expresses a certain value tendency in a book, but fails to achieve it or does not do it consistently in practice, or is perceived as such by readers, then the reader may turn from love to hate, or from fans to fans. black. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen said, &quot;The writer who likes little people the most and is good at portraying little people has also become a big shot after becoming famous.&quot; &quot;I bought an umbrella on the road, but my heart was already wet.&quot; He knows the truth of &quot;piracy is wrong&quot;, but whether it is true love no longer or misunderstanding or wrong love, this feeling is extremely real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[五星评分打底的宣传，就这？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260484]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;If you are a director and the screenwriter writes How would you shoot a rape scene? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should we use a large aperture to focus on the victim&#39;s painful face and the perpetrator&#39;s twisted body, or should we use a blurred lens to express violence with a line of blood, a cry of pain, and an angry and struggling hand? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you were a director, how would you show the pain of a single mother who lost her only daughter and did not hesitate to die with her enemies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should I express my mother’s feelings without any elaboration and use a few sensational lines and music, or should I express my anger at my daughter’s stigmatization, my despair at the distorted truth, and my sudden uncertainty about my future life?

The original work was not a good work, and the remake failed to make the story interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie is about a gold medal lawyer played by Zhang Xiaofei. After her daughter is kidnapped, she receives a mysterious phone call asking her to defend a criminal suspect. If she wins, her daughter will live, and if she loses, she will be killed. In order to save her daughter, she had no choice but to get involved, check the suspect&#39;s information, explore the life of the deceased woman, and then the entire case came to light. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that the choice of this subject was driven by female directors aiming at female stories. It’s a pity that we don’t see tenderness and empathy for female characters in the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, the intertwining of light and dark aspects of human nature and the gaps between love and hate in interpersonal relationships are where the tension lies in the story, but in this film, these are all ignored. The director likes to focus the camera on the emotional reactions of the characters, making them gasp, cry, anxious, have tears in their eyes, or have gloomy eyes. They like to use slow motion to show the somatic characteristics of people in pain. However, as for the undercurrents beneath these waves, But he didn&#39;t care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c8e979e942e077ea8429669a3b1036ae.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;487&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c8e979e942e077ea8429669a3b1036ae.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258040&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years There are a large number of female creators who constantly surprise us, such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge in &quot;Fleabag&quot; and Shao Yihui in &quot;The Myth of Love&quot;. They are all good at listening to the footsteps of their characters. Next, they bring their insight into the character&#39;s heart, their subtle description of desire, and their empathy for pain and separation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These perspectives are subtle and gentle, illuminating the hearts of the audience. Therefore, I am particularly looking forward to a female director remaking this story. Coupled with the constant positive reviews from the pre-release publicity, I expect her to be able to show the grief and indignation of a mother who is stunned, painful, resentful, regretful, and helpless, and finally goes to despair. This is a tragedy taking shape, and it also allows the audience to step on the edge of the protagonist&#39;s heart and resonate with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, the film did not record the footsteps of the tragedy. Without the sound of footsteps, the movie lacks the power to evoke emotions and thinking, just like a small cool drama mass-produced on a short video platform. However, it is also doubtful whether this film can really achieve the purpose of pleasing the audience like these low-cost, fast-produced dramas, because its pace is slow, and the twists are cliched and lack logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/fc2bc6cfbeff05c167b9868cf15b736e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;492&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/fc2bc6cfbeff05c167b9868cf15b736e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258039&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this The narrative completion that only stays at the visual excitement and superficial twists is almost a kind of surrender by the director: I can&#39;t understand the characters, I can&#39;t figure out the story, this is the only way I can go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know whether this is the director’s lack of confidence in his own expressive ability, or his habit of shooting movies as short videos: plots that do not ask for logic, emotions that are not patiently laid out, all the effort is spent on Play with various camera moves and reversals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard more than one person complain that movies in recent years, including Hollywood blockbusters, have become more and more short videos. There is a group of people who no longer want to film real stories, abandon the core &quot;people&quot; of the story, and choose to fill the audience&#39;s stomach with potato chips, popcorn and Coke. Therefore, popular hot words, amplified emotions, and reversal techniques are their operating formulas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/8cc113799c717260831859c21a4d1fb7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;489&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/8cc113799c717260831859c21a4d1fb7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258042&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend There are of course practical factors behind it. For example, viewers who are anxious about survival have reduced mental strength, no longer have the ability to empathize with others, and only desire quick emotional satisfaction. The creators followed suit, and film and television fast-moving consumer goods became very popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, responsible creators will still try to pull the tired audience out of the small world and tell them that Coca-Cola potato chips cannot provide real nutrition, and they will ultimately not be able to fill the empty hearts of adults. We need to go into the broader story and identify the emotional antidote that suits us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writing this, I originally wanted to avoid discussing the family background of the director of this film, but when I thought about it, it had close to 10% of the film schedule at the beginning of its release, the promotion of a five-star rating, and Hui Yinghong, Actors like Zhang Xiaofei can&#39;t help but think of the words of supermodel Victoria Ceretti against Depp&#39;s daughter:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Please don&#39;t compare yourself to me. I don&#39;t have a rich father. We Ordinary girls in this industry have to use their own efforts to gain everyone&#39;s respect. It doesn&#39;t mean that you can succeed by lying on the sofa of a mansion in Malibu.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being born in Rome is a blessing, not a mistake. . But after enjoying resources that most outstanding creators cannot enjoy, only handing in such an answer sheet will inevitably make people feel complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专家解答：得了支原体肺炎需要输液、“洗肺”吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260480]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, mycoplasma pneumonia in children has attracted widespread attention. When is a child contagious? Do I need infusion or &quot;lung washing&quot;? Worried about whether the hospital can be self-administered due to the large number of people in the hospital? On the occasion of World Pneumonia Day on November 12, the reporter interviewed relevant medical experts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After being infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, there is an incubation period of several days before the onset of fever, at which time the patient is contagious to a certain extent.” Zhou Wei, deputy chief physician of pediatrics at Peking University Third Hospital, said that wearing a mask can It can prevent infection to a certain extent, but it is not realistic for children to wear masks strictly and regularly. Going less often to crowded closed public places, ventilating the house frequently, regularly cleaning and disinfecting schools, and increasing outdoor activities are all helpful in preventing infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is infusion the best treatment for mycoplasma pneumonia? Zhou Wei said that some parents believe that intravenous infusion is better than oral treatment, but in fact there is no such conclusion. Treatment should be selected based on the child&#39;s condition. Children with severe pneumonia can choose intravenous infusion, while most children with mild illness can be treated with oral medications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;lung washing&quot; operation that parents are worried about, Zhou Wei said, &quot;This year, more children with mycoplasma pneumonia are indeed undergoing lung lavage treatment. Lung lavage has strict operating indications, such as patients with If the child develops atelectasis, local consolidation, or even very serious inflammatory reactions such as necrosis and sputum plug formation, lung lavage may need to be performed under a bronchoscope to unblock the airway, and it can also be seen under the microscope. To the extent of lung disease.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to mycoplasma, bacteria and viruses can also cause pneumonia. Ye Huan, director of the Respiratory Department of Beijing Chest Hospital, reminded that pneumonia patients often have typical symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, and young children and the elderly should pay special attention to precautions. It is recommended that people over 65 years old and children get the pneumonia vaccine. Although there is currently no vaccine against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the pneumonia vaccine can prevent a variety of pneumococci. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts remind that for pneumonia caused by different pathogens, the medication choices are also different. For example, for mycoplasma pneumonia, penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics are ineffective, and macrolide antibiotics are the most commonly used. Patients who are suspected of being infected with pneumonia should seek medical treatment in a timely manner and receive targeted treatment after diagnosis, and avoid blind medication such as &quot;self-administration of antibiotics&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为何总有体育馆塌顶：暴雪之下掩藏多少行业沉疴]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260478]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 20:27:34&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 7, 2023, Yuecheng Stadium after the roof collapsed.

Southern Weekend reporters found that there have been many steel structure roof collapse accidents in recent years: In April 2022, the roof of a swimming pool collapsed in Zhengzhou, Henan, causing 3 deaths and 9 injuries; in November 2021, the light steel structure roof of a project in Jinhua, Zhejiang collapsed, causing 6 deaths and 6 injuries; in March 2021, a grid roof collapsed at a construction site in Qingdao, Shandong, causing 1 death and 7 injuries; in May 2019, the roof of a steel structure building collapsed in Baise, Guangxi, causing 6 deaths and 87 injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not unique to China. Wang Luchuan (pseudonym), an expert in engineering accident research and former chief engineer of Beijing Urban Construction Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that roof collapse accidents of large-span structures are a common problem in buildings around the world. According to the cases he knows, stadium collapses have occurred in France, the United States, and Canada. ACCIDENT. “Currently there are relatively few cases of stadium collapse in China.” Wang Luchuan emphasized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many stadium roof collapse accidents point to the design form of fragile long-span steel structures. How did it change from a popular architectural style to the &quot;Sword of Damocles&quot; hanging above people&#39;s heads? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reduce costs, reduce loads&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 6, 2023, netizens focused their attention on the roof of the Jiamusi stadium that collapsed just five years after it was built. According to Xinhua News Agency, The roof structure of the stadium is an H-shaped variable-section steel beam structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang, chief engineer of Chengdu Southeast Steel Structure Co., Ltd., has 19 years of relevant experience. He told Southern Weekend reporters that this structure is called a portal steel frame structure in the industry, that is, doors made of H-shaped steel The structure can form a span of 20 to 30 meters, so there is no need to set up many columns. It is usually used in the design of small gymnasiums and factory buildings. &quot;The gymnasium in Jiamusi covers an area of ​​675 square meters, and the portal structure still matches the overall structure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This structure itself has no problems, it is simple and simple, and it is a relatively mature structural system.” Liu Yonggang explained that the steel structure has good toughness and high strength, and it can be built like building blocks. It can be built quickly and achieve good architectural effects. &quot;It is excellent in itself, but if it is not used properly, problems will occur.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang introduced that the first step to make good use of steel structures is design, and the first step in design is selection. There are many structural forms that can meet the long-span function, such as portal structure, grid structure, truss structure, etc. Among them, the portal steel frame structure uses the least amount of steel, and its processing and installation technology is relatively simple, so it is also one of these three structures. The cheapest among the structures. The stadium that collapsed in Jiamusi this time was a portal structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the type is selected, the next step is to calculate the load. Different load values ​​determine the amount of steel used and the compressive resistance of the building. In the Northeast region, in addition to the conventional wind loads, live loads, seismic loads, dust loads, etc. that need to be considered, the building design codes have additional provisions for the frequent heavy snow weather, that is, increasing the snow load. At the same time, in order to make it easier for snow to slide down, the roof slope is usually designed to be larger, but the increase in slope also means an increase in the cost. Photos of the interior of the Jiamusi Yuecheng Gymnasium circulated online show that the roof supported by H-shaped steel beams has a smaller slope, which means that the roof is easier to accumulate snow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether a building is designed safely is related to the designer’s personal expertise and experience, as well as the owner’s budget and requirements. Liu Yonggang introduced that designers from large design institutes will be more professionally persistent. For example, if they want to design a satisfactory and strong building, they will superimpose and evaluate all unfavorable factors, and then the designed plan will be relatively conservative, and the amount of steel used will naturally be higher. Increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For some owners who pursue maximizing profits and repaying their capital as soon as possible, &quot;obedient&quot; small design institutes are their first choice. &quot;Some owners are looking for costs. They will say, save me a little more, reduce the amount of steel used, and laymen will guide experts. Some small design institutes also want to survive, so they will try to figure out the load and meet the specifications. The limit.&quot; Liu Yonggang said. Yuecheng Gymnasium was designed by Jiamusi Architectural Design Institute. Liu Yonggang said that this design institute is a relatively small design institute. “It’s just that the design institute is small and it is not clear whether the design experience is sufficient.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The redundancy of this kind of stadium building design is too low. If you pile something on it, it will collapse. If you spend 100 yuan to keep it from collapsing, then you are willing to spend 101 Yuan, or are you willing to spend 200 Yuan?&quot; Wang Luchuan said frankly that he could understand, &quot;It is unlikely that the redundancy of such a long-span roof will be particularly high, so the cost will be too high. Like a bridge, an additional 10 % redundancy may increase the cost by 50%. But it cannot be given too low. It is really unjustifiable if it collapses in 5 years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 7, 2023, the person in charge of Yuecheng Sports Club and others have been controlled by the police.

Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“People don’t know goods, money knows goods”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, even having a perfect design plan does not guarantee the safety of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang, a professor at the School of Civil Engineering of Southeast University, wondered why a gymnasium that had just been built five years ago collapsed. &quot;The first five years are the best period for the house. It is impossible not to consider the snow load when designing. But if it collapses at this time, the problem is still quite big.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that if there are no problems with the design drawings, then Is the construction quality strictly controlled: &quot;For example, does the purchased steel meet the strength requirements, is the construction section strictly in accordance with the drawing requirements, and is the weld quality qualified?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the industry situation, in the steel components Quality risks may also exist in the processing and manufacturing process. Liu Yonggang introduced that some small processing plants only have two or three machines and can invest hundreds of thousands of yuan to process, but they often do not have standardized management structures, quality management systems and safety production systems to control product quality. &quot;For example, after the factory buys the steel plate from the steel factory, it cuts it into pieces with a flame, and then welds it to form each steel component. During processing, if the hole is punched out of place, it needs to be cut larger with a flame. This will damage the steel and shorten its original service life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regular enterprises have a complete management system. Liu Yonggang took his own company as an example, &quot;When we buy steel plates, we need to detect and inspect them. After they are processed into steel components, we have to inspect them ourselves and ask a third party to inspect them before they can leave the factory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On-site installation also requires attention to quality control. During the installation process, if the operation is not standardized, it will also cause quality defects and the designed service life will not be reached. &quot;Installation is equivalent to the final assembly of a car, which means bringing the processed steel components to the site for installation. It is best to have professionals do professional work.&quot; Liu Yonggang said that some irregular construction units bring a group of migrant workers to work, &quot; I was still farming yesterday, and tomorrow I will install the steel structure. If the accuracy of one place is not adjusted well, I will start the next step of installation, and it will be cut again and again, and errors will accumulate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Optimization&quot; is also a common problem during the construction process. Feng Ruoqiang said that in order to make more money, a construction unit that won the bid &quot;optimized&quot; the design height of the steel beam from 600 mm to 400 mm and the wall thickness of the steel beam from 20 mm to 12 mm during construction. In order to save labor in the welding process, low-level welders are used to replace good welders with high wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang believes that winning bids at low prices is the direct cause of the &quot;optimization&quot; trend in the industry. He found that the bidding prices of large companies are about 20% higher than that of small companies, mainly reflected in management costs, raw material costs and installation costs. “Our industry association also makes suggestions to the general contractor and the government, hoping that the price will not be lowered again and again. If the price is too low, if a small company does it, there will be problems such as &#39;optimization&#39;, cutting corners, etc., and ultimately it will be &#39;profitable&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is difficult to change. &quot;The difficulty now is still money. In order to put into production as soon as possible, the owner requires you to rush for work hours and save costs. Including government investment, it is also reducing costs. As long as you don&#39;t choose the cheap one, you have made a mistake. People don&#39;t know the goods. , money knows the goods.&quot; Liu Yonggang sighed with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Don&#39;t kill yourself&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sports venues designed and constructed in accordance with national standards cannot &quot;sit back and relax.&quot; In the specific use stage, safety mainly depends on the owner&#39;s consciousness, and there are no national mandatory standards. &quot;If a sports venue cannot be used correctly, it is prone to problems. During use, do not use it indiscriminately. People cannot go on the roof but you have to go up. There are no other loads on the roof but some additional loads are added.&quot; Many interviewed experts told Southern Weekend reporters The collapse of Qiqihar No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium was caused by more human factors. Its roof structure was called a bolted ball grid structure. Due to the illegal stacking of water-absorbing perlite, the load was excessive and suddenly collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Qiqihar Stadium is a typical example of improper use.” Feng Ruoqiang believes that during the blizzard weather when the Yuecheng Stadium collapsed, “As an operator, you either close the stadium or pay extra attention. During the use phase Operators must have sufficient safety awareness, which is very important.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among building materials such as concrete, steel structures, and aluminum alloys, steel structures have a fatal weakness, which is its corrosion problem. It is more susceptible to oxidation. After oxidation, the performance of the material will be greatly reduced. Many collapse accidents are caused by corrosion of steel structures. Therefore, the maintenance of steel structure houses is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The steel structures we build need to be repainted every 10 to 15 years, and the bolts must be checked to see if they have fallen off. We will recommend that owners perform annual maintenance, or conduct major inspections every few years, and deal with problems as soon as possible if they are found. Liu Yonggang said, but now many steel structure buildings are difficult to maintain after they are repaired. &quot;Either it is covered by the suspended ceiling or wrapped in the wall, making it impossible to repair some places. If a rod is bent, it is difficult to notice. Some rods are force-bearing rods. If they are suddenly broken, the force will be distributed If the other members cannot bear it, they will suddenly collapse.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang visited many gymnasiums in a city in East China. Out of professional habit, he noticed that the steel structure roofs of some swimming pools were corroded. It&#39;s amazing, the paint is peeling off, but no one pays attention to this problem. Some poorly maintained badminton courts install heavy chandeliers and suspended ceilings on the roof for the convenience of playing, which will make the venue unsafe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an ordinary person, how can we judge whether the steel structure gymnasium we are in is safe? Liu Yonggang introduced the key points of observation: &quot;We mainly look at a few places, first to see how it transmits force. For example, the roof receives the load, and the roof transmits the force to the beams, the beams to the columns, and the columns to the supports and embedded parts. Etc. Therefore, we look at it from the other side, whether the column bolts have fallen off, whether the column has deformed, whether the column elevation has settled, and looking further up, whether the supports between beams have fallen off, whether the beams have deformed, whether the purlins have Is there any bend?” However, when these problems can be seen with the naked eye, it means there is an imminent safety risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the collapse of the Qiqihar Stadium, Heilongjiang requested a comprehensive investigation of public welfare sports venues in the province; after the Jiamusi accident, the local government once again conducted a thorough investigation of long-span spatial structures including gymnasiums, requiring &quot;no discounts, Leave no blind spots and don’t go through the motions.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang believes that regular inspections by government departments are still necessary, but a solid inspection team must be formed. He suggested that the government could invite professionals in architecture and structure to &quot;focus on the inspection targets. First, check the stadiums with longer service life. If rust is found, apply anti-corrosion and anti-rust paint. Secondly, check the stadiums with lower design standards.&quot; Small and medium-sized gymnasiums”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Our construction in the past 20 to 30 years has been a bit too fast. Many times everyone is rushing for work. After the accident, we were also discussing that many steel structures have been repaired for more than 30 years. , especially some venues built in the early stage, should be maintained or demolished.&quot; Liu Yonggang said, &quot;The dividend period of our industry has also passed. In the remaining time, we need to think carefully about the development of this industry and not to kill ourselves. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot; >;(Hui Ze also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:55:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[没点中仇家的死穴，却点到观众的笑穴]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260444]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&quot;Acupoint Storm&quot; is the most recent comedy I have seen The most effective episode. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protagonist of the story, Numakura Koichi (played by Ryuhei Matsuda), was a child when his father owed a huge debt and disappeared, leaving him and his mother to depend on each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gangster leader who keeps collecting debts keeps an eye on my mother and will punch and kick him when he is unhappy.

It liberates us from a certain serious state and also liberates the protagonist from the weight of meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like Koichi Numakura in &quot;The Legend of the Underworld&quot;, he is full of revenge plans, but what he actually does is to save the life of the underworld leader.

It just sets a safe distance for us, allowing us to get a kind of psychological comfort from ridiculing the protagonist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After seeing that Numakura Koichi started to practice &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; diligently at the age of ten, and ten years later, he performed acupuncture on the underworld leader under a streetlight, and was beaten until his face was covered with blood. , the pain of being scolded as crazy also coincides with our feelings of working hard but not getting anything in return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d660e6b365ee5cd4d9b0329432df8966.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d660e6b365ee5cd4d9b0329432df8966.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257966&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comedy, use A sudden escape method brings the audience into some common experience or experience, and thus resonates with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Storm in the Cave Realm&quot; obviously understands this well, so most of its plot settings are deduced on this basis.
