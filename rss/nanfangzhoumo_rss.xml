Counter-terrorism officials said they were leading an investigation into the knife attack. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when the international situation is extremely tense, terrorism strikes France again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 13, 2023 local time, after a knife attack occurred in the northern city of Arras, France stated that it was on terror alert and raised the threat level to the highest level. The attack left one teacher dead and three others seriously injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just one day later, France’s Louvre Museum, Palace of Versailles, Lyon Train Station and other landmark buildings issued “emergency evacuation orders” due to security threats. Some Louvre museum visitors posted on social media that loud sirens were heard during the evacuation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just last month, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula issued a &quot;terrorist attack warning&quot; to France and Sweden through an internal publication. French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said in an exclusive interview with L&#39;Ouest-France that the authorities would respond as seriously as ever because &quot;the risk of terrorism remains high.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fear of the &quot;11.13 Paris terrorist attacks&quot; many years ago came to mind. Why is France always targeted by terrorists? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The risk of terrorist attacks has revived&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Eight years ago, after the &quot;11.13 Paris terrorist attacks&quot;, people took to the streets and stood at the site of the attack. Place condolence candles and flowers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 17, 2015, at the memorial site near the Rue des Fountains de la King in Paris, photographer Benjamin Filarski spotted a sad policeman leaning on the shoulders of his colleagues among the mourning crowd. Crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benjamin seized the opportunity and pressed the shutter, freezing the heartbreaking scene. He posted the photo on social media, titled &quot;Crying Police.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight years later, this scene of police crying, which represented the painful memory of France, appeared in a new round of &quot;terrorist attack notices&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report by French Commercial FMTV (BFMTV) on September 14, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) issued a &quot;terrorist threat&quot; to France and Sweden in its latest publication &quot;Voice of Combat&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a propaganda poster published by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a masked man is holding a long gun and looking down from a high position. Under cold eyes, two French policemen hugged each other and cried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the article of the promotional material was disseminated through a variety of Internet platforms. The article also suggested that after a series of scripture-burning incidents, Sweden &quot;led the EU countries in combating Islam and Muslim countries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is a radical Islamist organization mainly active in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. After the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January 2015, the organization &quot;claimed responsibility.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;criminal record&quot; and naked provocation have aroused concern among the French authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For a long time, we thought this would not happen again. However, Afghanistan, the Levant and Africa, etc. are funding it, which means the threat could happen.” 9, 2023 On March 20, French Interior Minister Darmanin warned in an interview that the risk of terrorist attacks in the country may resurface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Darmanin pointed out that the current main danger still comes from radical elements in France. These individuals, often radicalized progressively on the Internet, are deeply isolated, receptive to jihadist propaganda and respond to calls for hate. They use very limited means to carry out their actions due to reasons such as religious radicalization, imitation or mental fragility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates have reestablished themselves in some areas. In the Sahel, especially in the Levant and Afghanistan, drug networks are being re-established and have the potential to finance terrorism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With money, these groups can train jihadists on the spot, for example by infiltrating migrant flows. Like some of the perpetrators of the November 13, 2015 attacks. They can also do it remotely. Train other people,” Darmanin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Burqa ban&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Tug-of-war&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to French BFMTV report on September 15, the terrorist organization called for &quot;letting Muslim children &quot;Being alone&quot; and &quot;growing up under the protection of parents&quot;. This text, coupled with the threat against &quot;a ministry in Paris,&quot; suggests that Al Qaeda was referring to the recent &quot;Abaya ban&quot; in France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s hard not to link it to the recent ban on wearing abaya in French schools, although this was not mentioned at all,&quot; the report said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abaya is a loose robe that covers the curves of a woman&#39;s body. In French schools, it is common to see female Muslim students wearing abaya to school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August 2023, the French government banned students from wearing such clothing with obvious religious symbols on the grounds of the principle of separation of church and state. According to instructions from the education department, when the school term begins in September, students wearing abaya will not be allowed to enter the classroom. After that, the school will &quot;explain the meaning of the ban&quot; to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;French President Macron emphasized on this issue that the government &quot;will never give in&quot; on this issue related to the principle of secularism. He said, &quot;We know that there will be violations... Some may just be out of negligence, but a lot of them want to challenge republican values. We must not compromise.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the French government has banned the ban Despite the tough stance, some Muslim students still come to school wearing burqas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the French Ministry of Education, when school started on September 4, 298 students across the country were wearing burqas to school, and only 67 of them refused to take off their burqas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 7, local time, a girl from Clermont-Ferrand High School in France was banned from entering the school because she insisted on wearing a burqa to school. Subsequently, the girl&#39;s father issued a &quot;throat-cutting&quot; death threat to the principal. After the principal called the police, the parent was detained by the police that night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to student groups, there are also many Muslim supporters who oppose the &quot;burqa ban&quot; in various ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the French government issued a ban, three institutions, including the Paris-South Education Association, appealed. They asked for the ban to be suspended, saying that the ban violated &quot;fundamental freedoms.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, 2023, more than a dozen Muslim women gathered outside the French Embassy in Austria to express solidarity with French Muslim women over the abaya ban. In a video of the protest that circulated online, a woman wearing an orange robe and headscarf could be seen holding up a protest sign that read &quot;Abaya, our identity, our rights.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“France’s Muslim policy is actually part of its basic requirements for citizens of all ethnic groups.” Niu Song, a researcher at the Institute of Middle East Studies at Shanghai International Studies University, told Southern Weekend reporters that as far as religious clothing is concerned, it involves It’s not just the headscarf issue, clothing or symbols related to other religions, including Christianity, are also restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In other words, France&#39;s restrictions on religious clothing and symbols in the public sphere are not targeted at a specific religion, but the struggles of religious believers have always been accompanied by the policy implementation process. Even within French society, There are also different views on the understanding and implementation of the principles of republican assimilation and separation of church and state. In short, the fierce confrontations over headscarves and abaya clothing have not only torn French society apart, but are bound to anger conservative Muslim groups,&quot; Neuzon said. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After many days of debate, the French Supreme Court ruled on September 25 that the government’s ban on Muslim robes is “legal”. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;always &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;France? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From 2015 to 2016, the Bataclan concert hall shooting in France and the Charlie Hebdo attack occurred one after another, and violent terrorist attacks intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the &quot;Nice Coast Terrorist Attack&quot; that killed at least 84 people on July 14, 2016, the British security think tank &quot;Centre for Geopolitics and Security Realism&quot; (CGSRS) published a report titled The report &quot;Why It&#39;s Always France&quot; attempts to analyze the internal logic behind the high incidence of terrorist attacks in France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While other European countries have also experienced terrorism, &quot;France is showing a clear pattern&quot; and is &quot;particularly affected,&quot; the report said. At the same time, although the attackers claimed &quot;loyalty to extremist organizations,&quot; most of them were young French citizens and acted in small groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is France such a prominent target of homegrown Islamic terrorism? The report offers several explanations for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is foreign policy. The report said France has a long history of meddling in the Muslim world, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Islamists therefore often regard France as a &quot;legitimate target&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the composition of France’s population increases the possibility of Islamic terrorist attacks. For example, 7%-9% of the population is Muslim, which is much higher than other large European countries such as Germany or the United Kingdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa lack mobility opportunities and have lived in poverty for a long time, which has brought &quot;distrust and hatred&quot; towards French native people and institutions. Finally, France has a long tradition of secularism, and many citizens have a very negative view of any form of religion. This has left some Muslim groups feeling that their religious freedom is under attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Chinese international relations scholars also explained to Southern Weekend reporters why France is &quot;targeted&quot; by extremist organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nutson believes that within the Western camp, France has a relatively &quot;strict&quot; attitude towards diverse ethnic groups and faith groups, emphasizing ethnic equality and defending the principle of secularization, and does not allow religious elements to be excessively displayed in the public sphere. Therefore, contradictions and conflicts surrounding the issue of headscarves and abaya clothing will appear periodically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, there are structural contradictions between immigrants, refugees and European society, which include not only significant gaps in economic strength, but also differences in civilizational backgrounds. Countries such as Germany and Italy have relatively mild attitudes and policies towards Muslim immigrants, while France, due to its strict secularization policy, is more likely to intensify already accumulated conflicts on issues such as religious clothing, and it is difficult to maneuver around the issue due to its religious nature. room. France has naturally become the &quot;priority&quot; option for terrorist organizations to carry out attacks in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, told Southern Weekend reporters that France is the birthplace of modern European civilization. The concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity of the French Revolution influenced the entire Europe. However, the proliferation of freedom also brings offense to other civilizations, which will cause dissatisfaction among conservatives. At the same time, France has a large Muslim population, and actions against the external Muslim world will also cause internal backlash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As predicted in the &quot;Why Always France&quot; report, &quot;France may face more terrorist attacks in the future due to the complexity and depth of the problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;This&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is not new&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Except for the law Abroad, Sweden was also targeted in this &quot;terrorist attack notice&quot;. This is related to the controversy over the burning of scriptures by radicals in Sweden for several months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since June 2023, incidents of burning and desecrating Islamic religious texts have occurred in many places in Sweden. The main participants are Iraqi refugees Salwan Momika and Salwan Najim. (Salwan Najem). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two have publicly opposed the Islamic religious classic &quot;Quran&quot; on many occasions and held demonstrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, before this &quot;terrorist attack notice&quot;, Sweden had been &quot;named&quot; and intimidated by other extremist organizations due to the &quot;Scripture Burning&quot; incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the Al Qaeda media platform &quot;As-Sahab Media Foundation&quot; (The As-Sahab Media Foundation) called in an announcement titled &quot;The Obligation to Attack Aggressive Nations&quot; to Denmark and Sweden have retaliated against the burnings of scriptures that have occurred over the past few months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 13, the British Foreign Office issued a travel warning, stating that an attack was likely to occur in Sweden, and that its security authorities had foiled many attack attempts. The Chinese Embassy in Sweden also reminded that Chinese citizens should pay attention to changes in the current security situation in Sweden, increase security awareness, maintain a high degree of vigilance, and strengthen security precautions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 17, Sweden raised the country&#39;s terrorism threat level from Level 3 to Level 4 &quot;high threat status&quot; for the first time since 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Swedish authorities stated that this decision was based on a &quot;comprehensive, long-term and strategic judgment&quot; based on the deteriorating security situation in Sweden. Since then, many Swedish departments have strengthened security measures in borders, airports, public transportation and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the &quot;terrorist threats&quot; encountered by Sweden, Hans Brun, a Swedish terrorism researcher at King&#39;s College in the United Kingdom, believes that these threats are &quot;not new&quot; and not that important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Sweden&#39;s TT news agency, &quot;You can think of it as a call to action for individuals. If they had organized it themselves, they would not have announced it in advance like this. You should also remember that Al Qaeda is now greatly weakened.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brun said that Al Qaeda&#39;s statement will not affect the overall security situation. The biggest impact may be on Danish and Swedish diplomats working in the Middle East, who may need Take extra precautions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brunn’s “prophecy” is not groundless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, after radicals burned scriptures outside a mosque in the Swedish capital Stockholm, Iraqi protesters stormed the Swedish Embassy in Iraq, expelled the ambassador and burned the embassy. Iraqi Prime Minister Sudani even expelled the Swedish ambassador and suspended the work permit of Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, the Swedish government is seeking legal means to limit the intensification of scripture burning incidents in recent days in order to ease tensions with Islamic countries. However, supporters have argued that this could violate the country&#39;s constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Will they take action?&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As of September 8, 2023 Since the start of the Rugby World Cup, France has been hosting large-scale events, including the visit of King Charles III and the visit of the Pope, and these events will continue until the 2024 Paris Olympics. As French Interior Minister Darmanin lamented in an interview, &quot;The risk of terrorism is very high, and major incidents are coming one after another.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Darmanin said that in order to provide security for the Olympics, France has added 14,000 police and gendarmerie and is cooperating with multiple departments to deal with different risks. &quot;We&#39;ve been working on this for two years,&quot; Darmanin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the announcement of terrorist attack warnings, many people are worried about whether extremist organizations will take action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alain Rodier, deputy director of the French Intelligence Research Center, said in an interview with BFMTV that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took action two years after threatening &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;. &quot;This shows that Al Qaeda has the ability to wait.&quot; &quot;When they make threats, they often take action.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, Southern Weekend reporters contacted Alan Rodier via email, and he revealed many details about the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alain Rodier said that in 2013, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula announced 11 &quot;wanted persons&quot; through the online publication &quot;Inspire&quot;, including &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; cartoonist Stefan Stéphan Charbonnier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, two self-proclaimed terrorists from Al Qaeda, brothers Cherif Kouachi and Saïd Kouachi, attacked Charlie Hebdo, resulting in At least 12 people, including the editor-in-chief of the weekly, were killed and many others were injured. One of the perpetrators, Said, received military-style training in Yemen in 2011. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alain Rodier believes that since the 2015 attacks, the jihadist movement launched by extremist organizations no longer seems to target Western countries directly, but &quot;recruits through advertisements.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“These organizations do not appear to have sufficient means to send activists to Europe to carry out terrorist acts. We must ensure that their speeches are not exploited by endogenous terrorists,” Alain-Rodier said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Niu Song, from the Institute of Middle East Studies at Shanghai International Studies University, believes that under the global coordinated anti-terrorism offensive, Al Qaeda&#39;s influence is not as strong as before, but it still has the motivation and ability to carry out violent terrorist attacks. Therefore, Al Qaeda’s threat to launch attacks on France and Sweden should not be taken lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nutson said that in fact, the international community, including France and Switzerland, has always been highly concerned about and should be vigilant about the current trends and capabilities of al-Qaeda, and will not remain indifferent to its verbal threats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also people who are skeptical about this terrorist attack warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wasim Nasr, a senior researcher at the Soufan Center in France, called on the public to remain rational in an interview with the French &quot;Le Point&quot; magazine. &quot;There is no moment of panic yet. arrival&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that the magazine has a total of 17 pages, focusing on Yemen, and the threats to Sweden and France only appear on page 14. &quot;The threat is certainly there and we must take it seriously, but there is currently no reason to be more alarmed,&quot; Nasr said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Li Jinao also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴赫：国际奥委会正考虑创办奥林匹克电子竞技运动会]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258672]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Whether e-sports can be included in the Olympics, there may be a new answer soon. International Olympic Committee President Bach revealed here on the evening of the 14th that the International Olympic Committee is considering creating an Olympic Games that belongs to e-sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach made the above remarks while delivering a speech at the opening ceremony of the 141st Plenary Session of the International Olympic Committee held that night. He said: &quot;I have asked the new International Olympic Committee e-sports committee to study the creation of Olympic e-sports games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/15/c802d6c41ee832ef334118874cf8eb40.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;564&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/10/15/c802d6c41ee832ef334118874cf8eb40.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254123&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics, about 3 billion people around the world play video games. More than 500 million people are particularly interested in e-sports, including virtual sports and simulated sports, and most of them are young people under the age of 34. Bach said that the International Olympic Committee attaches great importance to this, so since 2018, the International Olympic Committee has been involved in the development of e-sports projects in an all-round way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have chosen a way that allows us to be active in esports while remaining true to the values ​​that we have lived by for more than a century. In esports, the values ​​have always been A red line we will not cross. Our clear stance has earned us growing respect from the esports community. A leading publisher redesigned one of their popular games to align with Olympic values ​​– so players Just shoot the target, not the person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the International Olympic Committee will host the Olympic Virtual Series. This is the International Olympic Committee’s first pilot project in the field of e-sports. Based on the successful experience of the Olympic Virtual Series, the International Olympic Committee held the first Olympic Esports Week this year, and the results were very popular - including the qualifiers, the esports series attracted more than 500,000 participants, and the competition Over 6 million live views across all channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach said: &quot;It&#39;s a promising start, but it&#39;s just the beginning. As in any sport, even after a promising start, the real game is still ahead. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach also talked about artificial intelligence in his speech that night, saying: &quot;Our continued success depends on how we embrace the accelerating development of digital technologies, especially artificial intelligence. This makes our &quot; &quot;Olympic Agenda 2020&quot; is even more urgent - &#39;Either change or be changed&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach emphasized that the International Olympic Committee must take the initiative, &quot;We must conduct a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence , and then take action immediately. I&#39;m happy to tell you that this work is already underway. If things go well, you may see some preliminary results in Paris (Olympic Games).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 141st Plenary Session of the International Olympic Committee will last until the 17th. The main agenda of this plenary session includes voting on amendments to the Olympic Charter and the project setting of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, and the election of several new International Olympic Committee members. In addition, the plenary session will evaluate the mid-term implementation of the Olympic 2020+5 Agenda and hear the plans for the 2024 Paris Olympics, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, and the 2026 Milan-Cortina d’Ampezzo Winter Games.

The employees of the maintenance shop in the service area threatened to stop the maintenance technicians hired from outside to repair the car. Is this &quot;reasonable and legal&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Jimu News, a truck transporting fruit broke down and failed to start while resting in the Jiangxi Fengcheng service area of ​​the Shanghai-Kunming Expressway. After the auto repair shop in the service area said it could not repair the vehicle, the driver himself invited a technician from a nearby designated repair shop of the truck manufacturer to come to the service area to prepare for repairs. Unexpectedly, he was blocked and intimidated by the staff of the repair shop in the service area. The maintenance technician who was invited had no choice but to leave. The truck driver contacted several local repair shops, but they did not dare to arrange for personnel to go to the service area to repair the vehicle. There was no choice but for the driver to drag the car off the highway to repair it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for car repairs to conflict with repair shops in expressway service areas. More than a month ago, a similar incident occurred in the Jiqing service area in Hunan. A truck driver was stopped by repairmen in the service area when he was inspecting his truck. After being told that the driver made the repairs himself, he uttered wild words. On social networks, similar complaints involving car repairs and tow truck conflicts on the highway are not the same. Some service area repair shop staff even use violence or threaten violence against drivers who repair their own cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the highway, can only repair shops in the service area repair cars? In an interview with the media, the person in charge of the Fengcheng service area said that the practices of the repair shop in the service area are &quot;reasonable and legal and have laws to follow.&quot; The law the person in charge refers to refers to the provisions of the Highway Law, Highway Safety Protection Regulations and other relevant regulations that &quot;prohibit the establishment of stalls within the scope of highways and highway land.&quot; This is obviously a misinterpretation. The so-called &quot;setting up stalls&quot; refers to setting up relatively fixed stalls for a long time and waiting for customers to come to your door. The purpose of prohibiting it is to avoid &quot;damaging, polluting the highway and affecting the smooth flow of the highway.&quot; After receiving the invitation from the customer, he temporarily went on the road to repair the car, precisely to repair the vehicle as soon as possible to avoid parking on the road for a long time and to ensure the smooth flow of the road. Regardless of the definition of &quot;setting up a stall&quot; or the legislative purpose of the regulations, it is completely legal for drivers to repair their cars by themselves or to invite repairmen to temporarily repair their cars on the road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the conflict at the Jiqing service area in Hunan mentioned above, the repairmen in the service area claimed that the Provincial Department of Transportation had a document that stipulated that &quot;people below&quot; (referring to repair shops other than the expressway) cannot go to the expressway for repairs. car, but ultimately failed to produce relevant documents. Do the traffic management departments in some places really have such regulations? If such a document does exist, it should be made public and reviewed for legality. If the government department does not have such regulations, is this an internal regulation of the highway management department, or is the service area repair shop lying? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In vehicle maintenance services, drivers and car owners are consumers, and of course they have the right to freely choose repair service providers. Auto repair shops in service areas prevent drivers from repairing their cars by themselves or other repairmen, and force drivers to go to their repair shops to repair their cars. This is a &quot;forced transaction&quot; behavior that is expressly prohibited by the Consumer Rights Protection Act. The Criminal Law also stipulates that using violence or threats to forcefully buy or sell goods, force others to provide services or force others to receive services, if the circumstances are serious, constitutes the crime of forced transaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are obviously illegal behaviors so common? The root of the problem lies in the word &quot;profit&quot;. As the person in charge of the Fengcheng service area said, off-road vehicle maintenance personnel going to the service area to repair cars &quot;harms the interests of the service area repair shops.&quot; The interests of service area repair shops are actually the interests of service area and highway managers. Expressway service areas, as part of expressway service facilities, are constructed and operated by expressway managers. If a repair shop opens in a service area, it must pay space rent to the highway administrator. These rents are generally higher than those for sites outside highways, because this is not only site rent, but also implies a premium for &quot;exclusive operating rights.&quot; Precisely because highway managers also benefit from the &quot;exclusive operating rights&quot; of repair shops, they will naturally try their best to protect the interests of repair shops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;exclusivity&quot; premium is very common in closed establishments. Food prices in airport terminals and highway service areas are generally much more expensive than in urban areas. Even canteens in primary and secondary schools can be auctioned for sky-high prices. This is all due to the monopoly benefits brought by the &quot;exclusive operating rights.&quot; More importantly, these premium benefits are not obtained through market competition, but rely on franchise rights granted by administrative power. For these infrastructure operators with administrative monopolies, the common practice in various countries is to strictly limit their profit margins to maintain a balance between attracting social investment and avoiding huge profits to maintain public welfare. To this end, they must be strictly supervised to prevent them from relying on their monopoly status to harm the public interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, there was an incident in a highway service area in Guangdong where a driver repaired his own car and was threatened by a repair shop employee. Due to public opinion and the intervention of relevant departments, the auto repair shop in the service area was shut down for rectification. The same incident occurred in Fengcheng, Jiangxi this time. The public expects local market supervision and other departments to take timely action to investigate and deal with forced buying and selling, and forced transactions to safeguard the interests of consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[身份证、退伍证、婚姻信息、家庭住址……当一个明星被“开盒”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258670]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the evening of October 12, Chen Muchi, who plays the role of Prince Yin Jiao in the movie &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot;, He posted a statement on Weibo, responding that he &quot;did have a marriage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/a4e19d459cf53705edb203836a30d784.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;413&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/a4e19d459cf53705edb203836a30d784.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254121&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why suddenly Admit that you have been married? It turned out that before Chen Muchi released his statement, a screenshot purporting to be his marriage registration information had been quickly circulated on the Internet. The screenshot contains very detailed information, including not only the registration certificate number, registration institution, registrar’s name and registration date, but also personal information such as the ID number and household registration location of both men and women. Some netizens even circulated an unmosaic version. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the melon-eaters discussed with enthusiasm was nothing more than: getting married and divorced at a young age? There was no response to rumors about a relationship on the Internet before, so why did you come out to respond when it was revealed that you were married? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some netizens pointed out that Chen Muchi had to respond because he was &quot;opened&quot;. Because not only his marriage registration information is spread on the Internet, but also his ID card photo, veteran information and personal contact number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/e216e7cb88a5f40d47751c7ce1ddfeef.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;854&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/e216e7cb88a5f40d47751c7ce1ddfeef.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254119&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is &quot; Open the box”? &quot;Unboxing&quot; is not essentially different from &quot;human flesh&quot;. It is an act of publicly exposing the privacy of others on the Internet with the purpose of &quot;breaking the other party&#39;s hypocrisy&quot;. It is actually an act of cyber violence that infringes on personal privacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, celebrities, like ordinary people, have the right to marry and love freely, and they can choose to do so publicly or not. Although celebrities, as public figures, will be exposed to the public eye and accept comments from the outside world, can their personal privacy be exposed at will and involuntarily? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem of personal privacy leakage reflected in this incident is more serious than many people imagine. Nowadays, any ordinary person will receive sales calls from different banks, credit, and real estate companies every day, and the leakage of personal contact information has become a common occurrence. For celebrities, their ID numbers are almost an open secret. Taking airport pick-up and drop-off as an example, how do fans learn about a celebrity’s travel itinerary? Most of them have the ID numbers and itinerary information of celebrities, and this information usually comes from illegal &quot;scalpers&quot; selling it for a few yuan to dozens of yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/18a2b1484d42333596d077e3559bf7b8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;617&quot; height= &quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/18a2b1484d42333596d077e3559bf7b8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254122&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/208f5fa16d95e7cd3c26e368dbbbbe9a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;505&quot; height=&quot;404&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/208f5fa16d95e7cd3c26e368dbbbbe9a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254118&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this information, they can not only grasp the star&#39;s schedule, They can also book air tickets and steal their mileage at will. Artists such as Li Chen, Wu Lei, Jiang Yingrong and others have all experienced situations where their airplane seats were changed and their mileage was stolen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the desire for voyeurism is infinitely magnified, some people will even use public power to satisfy such dark desires. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Chen Muchi&#39;s marriage registration information was exposed, many netizens questioned the source of the screenshots - from which channel did such detailed personal privacy information leak out? Was it the work of staff from the civil affairs system? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, on January 31, 2023, Hu Ge announced that he was getting married and had a daughter. However, because his wife was not a public figure, Hu Ge did not disclose her identity. Someone also exposed Hu Ge&#39;s marriage registration information, allowing netizens to discover that Hu Ge&#39;s wife is a staff member close to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/ae1f0a396113d36fa7ceeb8745b50d52.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;630&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/ae1f0a396113d36fa7ceeb8745b50d52.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254117&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have a lawyer Popular Science: In real life, no matter lawyers, courts, public security, or procuratorates, they cannot access citizens’ information at will.

The act of spreading other people&#39;s privacy based on the mentality of taking advantage of others will not only cause secondary harm to the victim, but is actually illegal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 1032, paragraph 1, of the Civil Code stipulates: &quot;Natural persons enjoy the right to privacy. No organization or individual may infringe on the privacy rights of others by means of spying, intrusion, disclosure, disclosure, etc.&quot; The right to privacy protects the privacy of natural persons. It can be seen from the word privacy itself that it has two characteristics: one is &quot;hidden&quot;, that is, it is not a public state. If it has been disclosed by a natural person or legally disclosed, it is not private; the second is &quot;private&quot;, That is, private matters have nothing to do with other people&#39;s rights and interests, public interests, etc. It is from these two aspects that Article 1032, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code defines privacy as: &quot;A natural person&#39;s private life is peaceful and he does not want others to know about his private space, private activities, and private information.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Article 1033 of the Civil Code stipulates that, unless otherwise provided by law or with the explicit consent of the right holder, no organization or individual may commit the following acts:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;( 1) Intruding on the private life and peace of others through phone calls, text messages, instant messaging tools, emails, leaflets, etc.;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(2) Entering, photographing, and peeping into other people&#39;s homes, hotel rooms, and other private spaces;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;(3) Photographing, peeping, eavesdropping, and disclosing the private activities of others;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(4) Photographing, peeping at the private parts of others’ bodies;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(5) Process other people&#39;s private information;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(6) Infringe on the privacy rights of others in other ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter whether you love or hate a person, you should not use the &quot;open box&quot; method to make other people&#39;s legally protected privacy and personal information public, and you must never do anything illegal. Blind tolerance and helplessness will only encourage the voyeurs&#39; desire for control and arrogance, allowing them to hide in dark corners and continue to do whatever they want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you are a celebrity or an ordinary person, your right to privacy is protected by law. Legal experts also emphasized that when the legitimate rights and interests enjoyed are illegally infringed, one should immediately call the police and use legal weapons to protect one&#39;s own rights and interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国足协换届选举产生新一届主席、副主席]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258674]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 10:13:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On October 16, the 12th Member Congress of the Chinese Football Association was held in Beijing to elect new members.

The probe successfully entered orbit. The two first stages of the launch vehicle All thrusters were recovered and the launch mission was a complete success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the whole mission has just begun. According to NASA: The probe will have to fly 2.2 billion miles (nearly 3.6 billion kilometers) to reach &quot;16 Psyche&quot; in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter in 2029, and orbit the asteroid for 26 months. scientific investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The magnetometer on board the probe will search for evidence of the asteroid&#39;s ancient magnetic field to prove the theory that it is the remnant of a fragmented planet&#39;s core. Gamma-ray and neutron spectrometers will help scientists determine the chemical elements that make up asteroids. A multispectral imager will provide information about its mineral composition and its topography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This exploration mission includes many first-of-its-kind scientific and technological innovations: This is the first time a human spacecraft has used Hall-effect thrusters (electromagnetic propulsion) in deep space beyond the lunar orbit. vehicle), driven almost entirely by solar energy, flew to the junction of the inner solar system and the outer solar system; it was also the first time for humans to explore the first M-type asteroid metallic body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA emphasized: This project is the result of comprehensive cooperation between the American scientific community and industry. The main research team is led by Lindy Elkins-Tanton of Arizona State University, and more than a dozen other universities and research institutions participate. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech in Southern California assist NASA with scientific management, systems engineering, integration and testing, and mission operations. Maxar Technologies&#39; team in California is responsible for the solar power system and the &quot;Hall electric pusher&quot;. SpaceX&#39;s Falcon Heavy launch vehicle is responsible for the probe launch mission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to NASA&#39;s scientific expedition mission, this project is of great significance to the future development of mankind. It can be said to be the first step in the exploration journey of &quot;interstellar mining&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;16 Psyche&quot; is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It was discovered by the Italian astronomer Gasparis on March 17, 1852. It was named after &quot;Greek mythology&quot; by humans. Named after Psyche, the wife of the soul and Eros, the god of love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The long axis of its ellipsoidal body is 225 kilometers, and it is almost entirely made of metal. Its mass is astonishingly large, about 272 million tons, accounting for about 0.6% of the total mass of celestial bodies in the &quot;asteroid belt&quot;. The metal proportion of this asteroid reaches 82.5%, and its main components are iron, nickel, and precious metals such as gold, platinum, and copper. &quot;Forbes&quot; and others value it at between US$1 billion and US$100 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists are curious: Why is the metal content of this asteroid so high? One theory is that it is the remnant core of an early planet in the early stages of the formation of the solar system. During the growth process of a planet, it was hit by other celestial bodies, and its outer crust and mantle were shattered into countless fragments, leaving only bare metal material. The original planetary core. The reason for this speculation is that the small &quot;Psyche&quot; actually has two large impact craters, and there is no sign of water or hydrated minerals on its surface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, human research on the planet’s core is still extremely limited. We have not even drilled through 1/3 of the thin crust, the outermost layer of the Earth’s structure. Research on the mantle and core can only be done. Make inferences based on seismic waves. If &quot;Spirit Star&quot; is indeed proven to be a rocky planetary core, then this cooled planetary core will allow humans to intuitively understand the structure of the planet&#39;s core and gain a deeper understanding of the planet&#39;s origin, evolution, and development. This will further promote the rapid development of geophysical research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA’s launch of a probe to the “Spirit Star” is undoubtedly paving the way for the commercialization of space resources in the future. This kind of investment in technology and capital is very long-term. Just like Prince Enrique in the early days of the &quot;Great Navigation&quot;, he continued to invest in the ocean for decades, but it took several generations for the Portuguese royal family to get feedback from the ocean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With human aerospace technology, the cost of mining from extraterrestrials and transporting it back to earth will be so high that 1 kilogram of pig iron is more expensive than the same weight of top-quality diamonds. So, why do NASA and Musk conduct such research and exploration? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author believes that their idea is not to smelt iron on the &quot;Ling Shen&quot; and then send it back to the earth, but to &quot;colonize Mars&quot;. &quot;Ling Shen&quot; is extremely far away from the earth, but relatively close to Mars. &quot;Mars colonization&quot; requires a large amount of building materials. If iron, nickel and other metals from &quot;Spirit Star&quot; are used, it will be much cheaper than transporting materials from the earth to Mars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Iron and nickel are the basic materials for making stainless steel. Using solar energy, space metallurgy is directly performed in a vacuum space environment. The production process is completely different from that on the earth, and no carbon-based energy and catalysts are needed. Musk insists on exploring the application of stainless steel in his &quot;Starship&quot; research and development, rather than the carbon fiber aerospace materials used by other countries. This can be explained logically: they have considered the selection of materials for large-scale infrastructure and manufacturing on extraterrestrial planets. question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Musk has also invested in Solar City to develop solar energy. This can be explained by NASA taking great technical risks to use solar-powered &quot;Hall thrusters&quot; in the &quot;Psyche&quot; mission. pass. In the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, solar radiation is already weak, so why choose a less efficient solar drive? It seems that NASA is exploring technology to improve the efficiency of its use under the conditions of low solar energy in deep space. This is the exploratory spirit of &quot;knowing that there are tigers in the mountains, and prefer to travel to the tiger mountains&quot;, which shows his great determination, firm will and action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I played the video game &quot;StarCraft&quot;, and &quot;interstellar mining&quot; was the first step in building a base. Unexpectedly, before reaching old age, human beings have already begun to try to realize their dreams. It can be said that thousands of sails are racing against each other and hundreds of teams are competing against each other. The vision of humanity becoming a space-faring species is getting closer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 09:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“飞越”按摩店：两位盲人的择业折返跑]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258668]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Blind masseur Sun Jingrui is massaging a customer.

Photo by Wang Xinyi&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ren Wenfeng&#39;s 15-year career as a blind masseur can be divided into two periods: in the first period he struggled with &quot;what can a blind person do&quot;, and in the latter period was he answering &quot;what can I do&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interval was a two-year escape - in 2019, he decided to escape from the blind employment paradigm and worked as a barista and telephone recruiter in Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about the same time, another blind masseur, Sun Jingrui, also chose to run away. After they briefly crossed paths in Guangzhou, the two lifelines bifurcated again, but they ended up reaching the same destination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 31, Ren Wenfeng returned to his hometown of Huanggang, Hubei Province and reopened a massage parlor in the small county town. He and his wife manage the small shop, which is about 40 square meters, and entertain three or four customers every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;34-year-old Sun Jingrui also returned to the massage parlor, but he chose to work in the metropolis Guangzhou. His store is also closer to the consumption perception of modern urbanites: warm yellow lighting, the fragrance of essential oils, supplemented by Mindfulness meditation. When there are not many customers, Jingrui will write plans or go out to connect resources, like an entrepreneur, thinking about how to build more chain stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the China Disabled Persons&#39; Federation, as of 2020, there are 17,300 blind health massage institutions in China. In the common discussion of &quot;What can blind people do without massages?&quot; Ren Wenfeng and Sun Jingrui may have many answers to this question, but one thing is for sure, although returning to a massage parlor may not seem to fit the mainstream narrative, it is Doesn&#39;t mean &quot;failed&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Falling into Darkness&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ren Wenfeng and Sun Jingrui are both acquired blind people, which means that they need one more layer of psychological construction than congenitally blind people. They want to eliminate all their once-visible selves, as well as their past thoughts, and learn to live in darkness from scratch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was 8 years old, a wooden stick flew in while playing and changed the direction of Ren Wenfeng’s life. The surgery failed to save his vision, and retinal detachment was a gradual farewell, which was more painful than a sudden plunge into darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He began to worry about his future life: Will he have to rely on his parents for the rest of his life? How will I support myself in the future? These questions all point to the same thing: What can a blind person do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day during the summer vacation, he listened to a radio program that introduced summer training classes to people. He called and asked: &quot;What can blind people do?&quot; The other party told him that he should contact the local Disabled Persons&#39; Federation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, the process of Sun Jingrui&#39;s blindness is like a person struggling in the water. When he was in junior high school, he was diagnosed with retinal detachment. Because it is discovered late, surgery is difficult to reverse the damage, which is almost equivalent to being declared blind. The doctor suggested that he go to a school for the blind to adapt to his future outcome in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Sun Jingrui decided to race against his eyesight. He wanted to get into a good university before he lost his sight, so that he could &quot;choose a major that is not too hard on the eyes and continue to live a normal life.&quot; Before suffering from eye disease, Sun Jingrui’s dream was to major in mechanical engineering at South China University of Technology. This was a place where he could realize his dream of becoming an engineer. But in his sophomore year of high school, the fog in front of his eyes became thicker and thicker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2006 was the year of Sun Jingrui&#39;s college entrance examination. The girl he had a crush on would call him and ask him &quot;When will he come back to class?&quot; She had sorted out the class content and was waiting for him. Sun Jingrui said vaguely &quot;next month.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jingrui could not wait until the day he returned to the classroom. With the disappearance of the last bit of light, he became completely blind. He no longer dares to go out for fear that others will notice the strangeness of his eyeballs. Occasionally, once he goes out every few months, he will outline the surrounding environment in his mind and turn his head frequently, trying to act like he was before he lost his sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For discerning people, career planning is a process of continuous focus: &quot;study-weigh-choose&quot;, and finally choose the track you are best at. But for blind people, massage parlors are one of the most common secular choices and one of the few stable careers for this special group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blind massage parlors are like blind paths in the city, existing but not noticeable. They are scattered throughout the city, set up at street intersections, on the first floor of residential buildings, or between barber shops and grocery stores. Most stores are simply furnished, with a few lamps, a few beds, and one or two chairs placed in fixed locations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ren Wenfeng’s first massage parlor job was in Wuhan, and he was contacted by the Disabled Persons’ Federation in his hometown. The massage shop is located on the second floor of a residential area. Four beds and two sofas are squeezed into the 20-square-meter house. At night, he called his mother and complained: &quot;It&#39;s too shabby. I want to turn around and leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But he persisted in the end: &quot;As long as there is a job that a blind person can do, anything can be done.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In 2011, Ren Wenfeng came to Shanghai from Wuhan. When customers at the massage parlor talked about urban life, Ren Wenfeng stood aside with envy. In his world, the busiest moment in Shanghai is the store celebration in June. The heat wave carries the crowds, sending the noise and footsteps into the store. The masseurs are busy amidst the waves of people&#39;s voices and the sounds of watches. . After the store celebration, the crowd dispersed, leaving the masseur in the dark. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the time is monotonous: working from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., food and accommodation are included in the store, and most of the time is spent waiting. Time just slipped between the thick and deformed fingers. In the view of Ren Wenfeng at the time, &quot;This is a job with no future, or even a present.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ren Wenfeng first worked, his slender and soft hands with clear joints were evaluated as &quot;a pair of hands that can be used to play the piano&quot;; now, after more than ten years in the massage industry, Ren Wenfeng&#39;s His fingers became as thick as a rolling pin. &quot;A hand that specializes in massage,&quot; someone praised him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Sun Jingrui has also noticed changes in his body. The muscles on the back of the hand are broad and thick, and the top of the thumb nail is slightly buckled due to years of exertion. The skin connected to the nail has shed its skin and is slightly white. In Guangzhou, he relieves the pressure on the shoulders and necks of many white-collar workers who sit in offices for a long time, but his own cervical vertebrae are tingling due to long-term fixed posture massage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jingrui is unwilling to live in a traditional massage shop. Pictures of the lives of discerning people in the past remind him from time to time. If he cannot return to the world of discerning people, he must at least make achievements in the massage industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sun Jingrui&#39;s thumb tip is peeling.

Photo by Wang Xinyi&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Beyond Making a Living&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Internet is one of the common channels for visually impaired people to contact the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2018, Ren Wenfeng learned about the &quot;Coffee in the Palm&quot; project of Hemu Innovation Center, a non-profit organization in Guangzhou, through an online forum. This is an activity to train visually impaired people to learn hand-brewed coffee skills and become baristas. As the road was being built in front of the store and business was not booming, Ren Wenfeng closed the massage parlor operating in Wuhan and went to Guangzhou to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yingzhang, the head of Hemu Innovation Center, was deeply impressed by him: &quot;I resigned from Wuhan and occasionally do some part-time jobs to supplement my income.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Sun Jingrui also used the Internet to The community gained access to the &quot;Dialogue Academy&quot; project organized by &quot;Dialogue in the Dark&quot;, a Hong Kong social enterprise. He sold the massage parlor he was running and went to Hong Kong alone for training as one of the six members who passed the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike Ren Wenfeng who started his career with massage, Sun Jingrui had the consciousness of entering the &quot;mainstream workplace&quot; when he just lost his eyesight. With good English, he once sought opportunities to work as an interpreter through a hotline program on a radio station. This experience ended in failure, which shattered his illusions about employment for the visually impaired. Returning to the field of massage, he also considered entering a hospital. But &quot;total blindness&quot; once again prevented him from getting a stable and decent job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem goes far beyond that. Finding a position that accepts visually impaired people is the first step. After entering the workplace, the challenge really begins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After becoming blind, more than ten years of experience in massage parlors affected Ren Wenfeng&#39;s character. Sensitivity and low self-esteem were the biggest challenges he faced in the &quot;mainstream workplace&quot;. When he was a barista, some customers would initiate conversations, but he could only respond with silence. In Ren Wenfeng&#39;s narration, his perception of the &quot;mainstream world&quot; is contradictory: like a mirror: on the polished surface facing outward, he wants to be recognized and prove that he &quot;can also accomplish many things&quot;; on the coated surface It is his timidity, he is afraid that others will notice his &quot;difference&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hong Kong, in order to adapt to the teacher&#39;s rhythm and language environment, Sun Jingrui needs to listen to class recordings repeatedly. &quot;Going to bed at two or three in the morning, and getting up again at six or seven in the morning, because class starts at eight.&quot; During the course, he was deeply touched by two parts. The first part is &quot;self-advocacy&quot;, where visually impaired students learn how to seek help in the workplace; the second part is skills training, including holding regular meetings, taking notes, organizing activities, etc. These ordinary people&#39;s daily work content is very new in Sun Jingrui&#39;s eyes. &quot;There is no such thing in a massage parlor.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When visually impaired people choose other jobs, they always subconsciously compare them with the massage industry. They use the massage industry as a frame of reference to view the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the practical part of the course in Hong Kong, Sun Jingrui needed to design workshops and course content alone in a social enterprise. With the help of his instructor, he gradually grew from an initial &quot;facilitator&quot; to an &quot;implementer&quot; of the project. By&quot;. He gradually discovered: &quot;I can actually do a lot of things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from Sun Jingrui&#39;s discovery of &quot;what he can do&quot; in the workplace, Ren Wenfeng&#39;s experience as a barista made him discover &quot;what he cannot or cannot do&quot; What do you like to do?&quot; Looking back now, Ren Wenfeng feels that knowing &quot;what not to do&quot; is the beginning of career planning - in this sense, although he failed to become an excellent barista, this experience is not a failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the limited income of a barista, Ren Wenfeng wanted to do something else. His second job is telephone recruitment: 30 phone calls a day that last for more than 30 seconds, corresponding to a basic salary of more than 1,000 yuan; if the other party is willing to submit a resume and successfully joins the job, he will receive a commission. According to Ren Wenfeng&#39;s rough statistics, the call answering rate is about 50%, which means that at least 60 calls need to be made every day. What is more difficult to control is that most of the answerers will hang up the phone in about 10 seconds. Rejection is normal, and what makes Ren Wenfeng even more unbearable are those unfriendly words. After a few months, Ren Wenfeng&#39;s performance was at the bottom of the group because he was not good at speaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Sun Jingrui also experienced telephone recruitment work. He summarized the job as &quot;repetitive&quot; and &quot;boring&quot;: &quot;I keep saying repetitive words every day, and even get scolded.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Guo Siyuan, a teacher at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Zhongkai College of Agricultural Engineering: &quot;The uneven quality of education for blind people is the pain point that restricts the employment of people with disabilities.&quot; Ren Wenfeng also described the problems encountered in the &quot;mainstream workplace&quot; The embarrassment is attributed to the lack of education. Blind people only need to learn the skills of living. As for spiritual nourishment and interpersonal communication skills such as literature, history and philosophy, it seems not so important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sun Jingrui&#39;s &quot;Healing Time&quot; store uses warm yellow as the main color.

Photo by Wang Xinyi&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Seeing” myself&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2021, after returning to Huanggang from Guangzhou, Ren Wenfeng started a family. Now the massage parlor he runs is facing the road, with a small yard behind it. Although it cannot be seen, he bought green plants and table lamps and carefully arranged this imaginary space. In his free time, he would make himself a cup of coffee with the sound of wind chimes and sunshine, waiting for customers and learning something new at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I returned to the massage parlor because I didn’t feel safe enough.” Ren Wenfeng said, “Many jobs are not only unstable, but may also have no income at all.” The stable income brought by massage parlors means that he Be able to feel more confident in front of parents, loved ones and neighbors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Take what you have learned back and open a store. This may be Wenfeng&#39;s most practical choice.&quot; Liu Yingzhang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the rush of big cities, small cities are more casual. The guests communicated with Ren Wenfeng about the details of the massage in their hometown dialect. Sometimes Ren Wenfeng would take the initiative to ask the guests &quot;does it hurt?&quot; He was no longer content to be a silent backdrop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jingrui’s store in Guangzhou opened in 2022. The store staff are partners who met during charity activities, and are supported by startup resources from the Hemu Innovation Center. The concept of the store is to use mindfulness to guide customers to observe their bodies, highlighting the masseurs Masseurs gain recognition through their professional skills and techniques, and no longer rely on selling essential oils and other peripheral products to gain value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of colleague Zhang Jinlan, Sun Jingrui&#39;s attempt to break through traditional massage parlors is &quot;very meaningful.&quot; Many customers will give gifts to the visually impaired masseuses in return, and will also hold their hands and show them the gifts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;White-collar workers like to call Jin Rui by his English name Ray, and some customers call him &quot;dolphin&quot;. He said he likes this nickname: when humans are drowning, dolphins will lift humans to the surface of the water. In daily life, Jingrui is willing to enlighten his visually impaired friends and lift them out of the &quot;ocean&quot; of emotions. Whenever Zhang Jinlan encounters difficulties at work, Sun Jingrui will list the key points and reason with her one by one. &quot;He is a partner who can fight side by side.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jingrui hopes to help more visually impaired people to see outside, but &quot;support&quot; alone is often somewhat ineffective. He is too embarrassed to persuade directly, and sometimes adopts &quot;circumstantial tactics&quot;. For example, he pretends to be relaxed and says to his friends: &quot;There is a speech club tomorrow, who is free to go and play together?&quot; Friends will find it very novel, but once they arrive, When it came time to perform on stage, they felt &quot;too shy to do it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jingrui also faced such a dilemma. In Liu Yingzhang&#39;s view, Sun Jingrui is considered the &quot;elite&quot; of this group. When he first came to the center to participate in an event, Sun Jingrui wore sunglasses and greeted everyone in fluent English. This &quot;big brother&quot; temperament left a deep impression on Liu Yingzhang at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At work, Sun Jingrui initially had the inertia of &quot;relying on discerning managers&quot;. Currently, the Hemu Innovation Center&#39;s &quot;Palm Coffee&quot; and &quot;Healing Time&quot; massage parlor projects are managed by visually impaired people, who independently lead visually impaired and non-visually impaired employees to participate in market competition. Models of leadership for people with disabilities are fundamentally different. They hope that this model can break the prejudice that visually impaired people can only play subordinate roles in the workplace. One day, with a little guidance, they can actively explore the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sun Jingrui&#39;s personal photos widely circulated on the Internet.

The biggest change for the Ewenki people in this relocation is the ban on guns. This meant the end of their traditional safari life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was wandering around the countryside and talking to people about guns. A bystander immediately gave me directions: I have to ask Boss He for this. Who else knows better than him? There was a hint of teasing in the tone - at the time, I didn&#39;t know what the story was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to find Mr. He. Most of the time, he and his wife Zhuo Ye sit quietly on the bench in front of their home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boss He&#39;s real name is He Xie, the eldest son of &quot;China&#39;s last female chief&quot; Maria Suo, and the last generation of hunters among the Ewenki people. As soon as I arrived in front of his house, he invited me to sit down and opened a bottle of Hyrule beer for me, which was his way of hospitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I learned that the gun caused He Xie trouble just last year. When he collected his guns around 2003, he hid a small-caliber gun and sold it to someone else in 2022. After being reported, the court sentenced him for reselling firearms. He Xie couldn&#39;t figure out how the verdict was written, but he remembered that it was &quot;a second sentence with a three-year reprieve&quot; and his pension was gone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, He Xie doesn’t care about money that much, as long as it’s enough. The couple lives on Zhuoye&#39;s monthly pension of more than 4,000 yuan, and they are a &quot;moonlight family&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend of He Xie told me about what happened not long ago. Some time ago, He Xie borrowed 500 yuan from him and said he wanted to use it to repay the money. As a result, He Xie paid back the debt of more than 100 yuan, and the remaining money was spent on braised beef and beer. The couple bought more than 300 pieces of meat, but they didn&#39;t eat much of it, so they fed it all to the dogs in the village. &quot;Isn&#39;t this a waste of money?&quot; This friend was somewhat angry when he mentioned this. He also had nothing to do with He Xie, &quot;This guy doesn&#39;t worry about anything!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of He Xie&#39;s actions were really helpless. During the interview, He Xie and others, I went back to the old Ao Township before the relocation, and stayed in a nearby B&amp;B that night. Even though the no-smoking notice was prominently posted in the lobby of the B&amp;B, He Xie still started smoking as if no one was around. A fellow traveler advised him to go out and smoke, but he persisted again: What&#39;s wrong with having a cigarette? The rules of modern society are basically invalid for him. The owner of the B&amp;B had to remind us repeatedly that we must check He Xie&#39;s stay and that there must be no smoking in the room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Aoxiang, he became a type of person who &quot;has not made progress&quot;. Bai Lan, a researcher at the Institute of Ethnology of the Inner Mongolia Academy of Social Sciences, has been following the Ewenki people for more than 30 years and has become old friends with He Xie&#39;s family. She told me that in July 2023, she went to Aoxiang to participate in a tourism forum. When he met He Xie, he was almost done drinking. The township head quickly asked the staff to send him home. &quot;With so many leaders coming, (worried) He Xie would be embarrassed to leave him there.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving Aoxiang, I planned to say goodbye to He Xie. As soon as he entered the door, he was lying in the room with his head down and sleeping. Zhuoye told me that He Xie had been lying in bed all day. Two days ago, he had guests. He was happy and drank heavily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to Beijing, I read &quot;Aoluguya·Aoluguya&quot; written by the documentary director Gu Tao, which is a collection of his diaries while filming the &quot;Ewenki Trilogy&quot;. The He Xie described in the book looked completely different to me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Gu Tao&#39;s book, he is the &quot;little leader&quot; who has the dignity of a hunter in the mountains. &quot;When sawing deer antler, He Xie always had to take a few sips at the blood spurting antler, his eyes narrowed, his hair curly, and his face splattered with blood. Others would be frightened when they saw it, but he enjoyed it very much. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the hunter&#39;s point, He Xie&#39;s aura can calm those who steal wine. &quot;Weijia and Mao Xie (both are Ewenki hunters) did not go looking for deer, but took a ride to Aaron Mountain to look for wine. At noon, Mao Xie and Weijia came back drunk, and when they saw Boss He, they hid quietly back I fell asleep in my own tent.&quot; &quot;As long as He Xie is on point, Mariasuo won&#39;t worry.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I can’t help but think, if they still had guns and could go hunting in the mountains, why would the association be different from its current status? Of course, this is just an invalid assumption. It will happen sooner or later that the Ewenki people, who have only one to two hundred people, will be integrated into the modernization process. There will always be one or two generations among them who will become victims in this process. Their previous generation had fully enjoyed life in the mountains and forests, while the next generation, without so much baggage, had discovered new ways of living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some scholars believe that from the perspective of national governance, this is a sacrifice that must be made. The rational attitude is to remember those who sacrificed and provide them and future generations with certain compensation. &quot;This is reality.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Bai Lan said that she has been thinking about how to give the Ewenki people more freedom of choice in the development process and allow the tradition to continue. However, she still has no conclusion yet. &quot;As a researcher, sometimes I feel like I have failed.&quot; My heart skipped a beat when I heard Bai Lan say this. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a reporter, all I can do is record the current living conditions of the &quot;victims&quot; and resist forgetting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/CoPO3sir3sJ83J1WYSZA9THj2LsdK3ILWHYsS49V.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1073&quot; height= &quot;771&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/CoPO3sir3sJ83J1WYSZA9THj2LsdK3ILWHYsS49V.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254108&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the evening of July 23, 2023, He Xie sat on the curb in the settlement and drank. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[民政部：去年办理结婚登记683.5万对，比上年下降10.6％]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258666]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/15/07130c1404f69430cfe64d18eafb5200.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;597&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/15/07130c1404f69430cfe64d18eafb5200.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254111&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days ago, the Ministry of Civil Affairs released the 2022 Statistical Bulletin on the Development of Civil Affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statistical bulletin shows that in 2022, there were a total of 4,310 marriage registration institutions and venues across the country, including 1,103 marriage registration institutions. 6.835 million marriages were registered in accordance with the law throughout the year, a decrease of 10.6% from the previous year.

He persisted. In an empty classroom, he discusses with six students once a week the ultimate question of life - how to make himself and others happier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the second academic year, the number of students taking the course increased to 380, and more than 20% of students reported that this course had improved their personal lives; in the second semester of the academic year, 855 Harvard students took the course this course. Within a year, Shahar&#39;s positive psychology course became Harvard&#39;s most popular course, and his other course, &quot;The Psychology of Leadership,&quot; was also one of the school&#39;s most popular courses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This young scholar who just stood on the podium has become one of the most popular mentors in Harvard history. Driven by the spirit of sharing, since 2006, the &quot;Positive Psychology&quot; he teaches (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;is also known as the Happiness Course&lt;/span>; ) was filmed and made into a public course and open to the Internet for free. Its influence quickly overflowed from the Harvard campus and was watched, downloaded, and shared by countless people around the world. Together with Michael Sandel, a Harvard political science professor who teaches a course on justice, Shahar has become a world-renowned scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shahar, 53, was born and raised in Israel. His ancestors were Jewish businessmen living in Europe. During the Zionist movement of the last century, they brought their families back to the &quot;Promised Land&quot; given by God. In Shahar’s childhood memories, his grandfather, a businessman, would spend hours every day studying the Hebrew Bible and Talmud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the influence of orthodox Jewish culture, his childhood was also shrouded in the clouds of bloody violence and terrorist incidents in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. &quot;Every morning when we wake up, we worry about bombs on the bus going to school; when we go to the restaurant to eat, we worry about the restaurant being bombed,&quot; he recalled calmly. His first memory of the war came from the sirens outside his window when he was less than 3 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Childhood memories and the tenacity of his parents and grandparents left an indelible impression on Shahar. After studying in the United States and achieving academic success, he resigned from his position at Harvard and returned to his native Israel to establish the &quot;Happiness Research Institute&quot; to promote positive psychology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While studying at Harvard, he studied Chinese philosophy with the famous Chinese scholar Du Weiming. Confucian humanism and Taoist thought made him feel both familiar and &quot;illuminated&quot; by wisdom. In the process of promoting and developing positive psychology, he also drew theoretical and practical wisdom from traditional Chinese classics such as the Tao Te Ching, the Analects of Confucius, and the Great Learning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, Shahar came to China to give lectures on average twice a year. The &quot;Happiness Research Institute&quot; he founded had more than 400 students in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After four years, he visited China again at the end of September 2023. In a Shanghai hotel full of quirky 1990s style elements, we discussed trauma, antifragility, Confucianism and Taoism, and how to overcome PTSD (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Trauma &quot;Post-Stress Disorder&quot;&lt;/span>;) and to discuss topics such as growth, he was interviewed by me, a Chinese journalist who is partially skeptical of &quot;happiness science&quot; and instrumental methodologies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/w7Y894iV4LPPLjmkqLk3Qpe60cvMnPnWW9i6SQ6P.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/w7Y894iV4LPPLjmkqLk3Qpe60cvMnPnWW9i6SQ6P.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253681&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 27, 2020, due to the impact of the new crown epidemic, the training hall was closed.

Are there some changes? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I feel some. However, what I experienced and observed in China is not unique to China. The past three years have been challenging for people and they have become more anxious, sadder and more worried than before. The challenge we face is not just how to overcome anxiety, sadness, or worry, but also how to potentially become stronger after experiencing it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That’s why the science of happiness is so important today, because it provides us with tools, tips and advice to help us potentially become stronger after going through hardships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past four years, have you paid attention to the society from China?

We found that cultural differences certainly exist, but from a global perspective, people are more similar than different. Chinese, like Americans, Brazilians, Germans, and Australians, all have more differences than in the past. Feelings of security and anxiety. The global pandemic affects people in every corner of the world. So, that&#39;s why psychologists, political leaders need to work together to find solutions to the problem. That’s why I’m so looking forward to speaking with Professor Peng again. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What kind of societies did you talk about during the epidemic? Psychological problems? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We talked about a new concept proposed by New York University professor Nassim Nicholas Taleb - &quot;antifragility&quot; , is about how it is possible for us to grow after experiencing hardship, hardship, or trauma. Repair is just returning to the past state. We should also grow from the experience, not PTSD, but PTG (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;post-traumatic growth&quot;&lt;/ span>;). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, most people do not grow after experiencing trauma. They either suffer from PTSD or other forms of psychological problems, such as anxiety, loss of security, sadness, and even depression. . So, the real question is: What can our schools, institutions, and families do to help everyone increase the likelihood of getting PTG, and what can we do to improve antifragile capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A well-known psychologist put forward an insight. He said : In China, social psychology and cultural psychology are and will continue to be the mainstream of psychological research in the future, because the mental state of Chinese people is almost determined by the era in which they live; while in the United States, clinical psychology is Mainstream, because Americans always want to find a doctor to solve his/her individual mental crisis, such as why he/she just feels unhappy. In these two countries with such different mental and personality profiles, what role can &quot;non-mainstream&quot; positive psychology play? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Indeed. I would like to answer this question from a chapter found in the Confucian classic &quot;The Great Learning&quot;. Zengzi, a disciple of Confucius, said in &quot;The Book of Rites and Great Learning&quot;: &quot;In ancient times, those who wanted to establish virtue in the world first governed their country; those who wanted to govern their country, first organized their families; those who wanted to regulate their families, first cultivated their own bodies. ; If you want to cultivate your body, you must first rectify your mind; if you want to rectify your mind, you must first be sincere in your intentions; if you want to be sincere in your intentions, you must first know how to know, and knowing can be achieved by studying things. After studying things, you will know them, and after knowing them, your thoughts will be sincere. If the mind is sincere, then the heart will be upright; if the heart is upright, then the body will be cultivated; if the body is cultivated, the family will be in order; if the family is in order, then the country will be governed; if the country is governed, then the world will be peaceful.&quot; Confucianism believes that if a person wants to promote good morals in the world, he should start with himself, and then Ascend to the task of governing your family, then to govern your country, and then to the world. Do you know Du Weiming? He was my teacher at Harvard, and I studied Confucian humanism from him. He talked about how Confucius started from the large circle of &quot;the world&quot;, to the country, to the family, and then to himself, starting from self-cultivation. To me, Chinese philosophy is very good at integrating individual people with society. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confucius was right. If we want to build a better society, we cannot just focus on social matters, and certainly not just on the clinical (treatment plans). We need to look at it holistically, analyzing, understanding, and acting at all levels, including individuals, families, countries, and the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/9PlvUXlLLBpC3SxCC6bBVMWoIhmtHCr06tElGUJ7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/9PlvUXlLLBpC3SxCC6bBVMWoIhmtHCr06tElGUJ7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253682&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 12, 2020, Wuhan, the iron gate leading to the main road was still closed. Residents of the old alley spontaneously danced and worked out in front of their homes after dinner&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;Can you tell me specifically how to act? For example, young people in China are now facing employment difficulties. Many people are taking public exams, editing exams, and postgraduate exams, and the competition has become extremely fierce. If you repeatedly fail in employment, public examinations, and postgraduate entrance examinations, it will lead to what is called &quot;learned helplessness&quot; in psychology. How does positive psychology play a role in this kind of representative psychological state of a specific group? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The most obvious way to deal with &quot;learned helplessness&quot; is to continue to act. Because the typical feature of &quot;learned helplessness&quot; is to no longer act, but to just give up and retreat, and trying again becomes a huge challenge. So, even if you fail, still try. If you fail five times, try the sixth time. One of the most important qualities of successful people, such as successful entrepreneurs, is the ability to succeed despite repeated failures. This is for the general case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More specifically, one of the antidotes to &quot;learned helplessness&quot; is to help others. Let me explain: Over the years, there have been numerous social surveys in the United States focusing on high-risk groups. By &quot;high-risk&quot; we mean residents of poor neighborhoods, where crime rates are often high and children do poorly in school. Researchers first came to these poor areas to provide food, money, etc. to the residents there, and provided them with various funding projects. They found that very few of them had their situation changed. In the end, the researchers found that the most effective way to change their situation was to get them to stand up and help others. When they begin to do this, they can escape &quot;learned helplessness&quot; and become capable of helping others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the words of current Chinese people, this is very positive energy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It does work. Therefore, one of the best ways to make ourselves happier is to think about how we can make others happier instead of always leaving ourselves helpless. As Confucius taught, connect yourself to society and the community. Additionally, it is a way for people to feel better about themselves, which is often what clinical psychology is concerned with. We need to start thinking about the realities that impact society, the realities around us, because helping those around us is actually helping ourselves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because no one is an island, we are all part of the whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/P80kOVKz761jkiIMtGUA8hmR7dKfGgakxO3jtsAn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/P80kOVKz761jkiIMtGUA8hmR7dKfGgakxO3jtsAn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253680&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 11, 2022, in Jerusalem, Israel, medical staff performed nucleic acid tests for people&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Spiritual life&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As As a positive psychologist, how did you spend your time during the epidemic, especially the lockdown period? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First of all, I struggle from time to time. Life does get tough. You know I&#39;m eager to come to China, and I&#39;m eager to hug my friends. I probably couldn&#39;t see my parents for over a year. We live in New Jersey in the United States, and my parents are in Israel. They are very old, and we are worried about them getting infected with COVID-19, but we cannot travel. I miss them so much and it&#39;s challenging. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can’t go to a restaurant with my friends to eat either. We had friends visiting our house all the time, the door was always open, and there were a lot of people coming in and out, friends of my wife and I, friends of the kids. Suddenly, the pandemic hit and it was just us and the kids in the house. Of course we have to be grateful for what we have, but it’s always hard not being able to see and be with the people we love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, my main job is to attend classes and give lectures, so I also face challenges on the economic level. So, in a lot of ways, I was struggling with my feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to face these challenges, I returned to the most basic methods of positive psychology: for example, I know that fitness is important for a good life. I used to exercise three times a week, but during the epidemic, I increased it to five times; I used to do mindfulness training every day, and now I add more training, sometimes doing yoga, sometimes Tai Chi, sometimes Qigong, and sometimes meditation; I also try to spend more time with my family as much as possible, and the whole family is together every day Eating dinner, talking, and sometimes crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also continue to work, continue to write, and continue to read. The most important thing is to allow myself to experience all these emotions, not to fight the sadness, not to try to eliminate the anxiety, to accept that they are there, to allow these emotions and feelings to flow through my soul like water, that is the metaphor I use. , don’t try to “block” or block or interrupt them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During the lockdown, you had moments when you lost control of your emotions, such as Kids yelling? After all, being in the same house with three teenage kids all day can be challenging. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is very challenging. I don&#39;t usually yell at kids, but I do get really annoyed by them sometimes. Even now that I can go out freely, I still get annoyed by them sometimes. I think it&#39;s important for parents to love their children but also set boundaries for them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, during the epidemic, when one of my children didn&#39;t do his homework assigned by school, I got very angry and told him that something had to change because the teacher had complained. People think that if you are a professor of happiness, your home must always be filled with a happy and harmonious atmosphere. But that&#39;s not the case. You have to understand this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I would like to ask a very personal topic, do you have any religious beliefs? ? Personally, positive psychology is a social science that emphasizes value neutrality. However, compared with a set of tools and methods, are values, beliefs and even religion more important for a person to maintain a positive and healthy mental state for a long time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am religious. But in my classes, one of the main points I emphasize is that each of us can live a spiritual life, regardless of whether we are converted to a certain religion or not. Because when we find the meaning of what we do, we have a spiritual life. I can be a teacher, I can be an institutional administrator, I find meaning in my work and therefore feel spirituality. I was able to find meaning in raising a family and also had spiritual experiences. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, instead of saying that I am a religious person, it is better to say that I am spiritual. I feel meaning and purpose in both my personal and professional life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It seems that we all agree on one thing - in positive psychology Under the iceberg of learning, there must be more basic things, such as values, beliefs, beliefs or religions, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Indeed. These things will give us purpose in life and find purpose in life. Again, we can find it in different areas, some find it in faith, some find it in work, some find it in family, or elsewhere. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, do something that you believe in, is important to you, and is of great significance. That&#39;s the point. If you want to do well and stick with it over the long term, you also need to find where your talents lie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are from Israel and have a Jewish cultural background. Have you ever summarized some experience or wisdom from the life stories of your own family and ethnic group? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Many people ask me why you come to China more than other countries and why you have so many Chinese student. I replied that the first time I came to China was about 20 years ago, and it felt like I was back in my hometown. This is real. Because Jewish tradition and Chinese tradition share many similar values, such as the emphasis on family and family, the concept of family is very important in our history. I feel that I have a strong connection with China, including its history and philosophy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for you asking me what I learned from my ancestors and ethnic history? First, we are able to overcome long-standing suffering by connecting to sources of strength, including nature and community. These are two very critical factors. By nature, I mean both the external world and our nature as humans. So, Lao Tzu talks about the importance of learning from nature. Taoists say that &quot;Tao follows nature.&quot; The Tao of earth and the Tao of heaven are &quot;Tao&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to share with you a passage from the Tao Te Ching: &quot;Man follows the earth, earth follows the sky, heaven follows the Tao, and the Tao follows nature.&quot; When we connect with nature, we can gain strength from it. . This is the first source of power, then the second source. Confucianism talks most about community, and talks a lot about the various rituals when communities come together. In Judaism, we also have many rituals when family members are together. When I visit my friends&#39; homes in China, I often sit with their parents and sometimes grandparents. They usually speak Chinese and I don&#39;t understand what they are saying, but I understand the connection because the same scene can be seen in Israel. That is the source of our strength as Jews—nature, community, and that includes family. Just like Confucianism teaches: from oneself to the family, to the larger group-the country and the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I would like to ask a question with more personal experience. I remember that when I was a child, I could see international news about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on TV almost every day, including suicide attacks. I thought it was very scary. You spent your childhood and adolescence in Israel. Does this kind of violent information or even experience from the outside world bother you and your friends? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You know I grew up in Israel. Every morning when we wake up, we worry about the bomb on the bus to school; when we go to the restaurant to eat, we worry about the bomb in the restaurant. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My first memory of the war is from when I was less than 3 years old, when sirens rang in the streets and we had to rush to underground shelters to hide for fear of being bombed. Or get blown up. So, you understand what I grew up in and what I went through. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;He is less than 3 years old. As a child, how do you face this? The fear of brushing against death every day? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Shahar: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Just like you do with all other traumas, hardships and hardships. You have a community around you that supports you. You talk about it, write about it. In the meantime, keep exercising, find things that are meaningful to you, and find things that you can be grateful for. These strategies are always useful when we face a traumatic experience, whether it’s COVID-19, a job loss, or the loss of a loved one. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the tools and techniques taught to us by the science of happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
