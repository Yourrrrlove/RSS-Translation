Recently, based on the remarkable results achieved in the previous work, the crackdown has achieved another major result. 497 telecommunications network fraud suspects were handed over to the Lincang Public Security Bureau in two batches, and 209 telecommunications network fraud suspects were handed over to the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau. Among them, online There are 26 people at large, which has effectively dealt a blow to the arrogance of overseas fraudsters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since September this year, the public security agencies in Xishuangbanna, Pu&#39;er and other places in Yunnan have carried out border police law enforcement cooperation with relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar. A large number of overseas fraud dens have been successfully eradicated, and a large number of telecommunications network fraud suspects have been successfully eradicated. The person was handed over to us. In order to continue to build momentum and advance the crackdown in depth, under the command and deployment of the Yunnan Provincial Public Security Department, the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau further expanded its results. 209 telecommunications network fraud suspects were successfully handed over to us on October 1. At the same time, Lincang Public Security Bureau&#39;s border police law enforcement cooperation has made significant progress. The relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar handed over 497 telecommunications network fraud suspects to us in two batches on September 25 and October 7 respectively. This is another important breakthrough made by the Yunnan public security agencies in border police cooperation, following the Xishuangbanna and Puer public security agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, relevant criminal suspects have been detained by public security organs in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Chongqing and other places involved in the case. The public security organs will thoroughly investigate all the facts of his crimes, and while cracking down on fraud crimes in accordance with the law, they will also dig deep into related crimes such as black and gray products in the country to ensure that the entire chain is cracked down and severely punished in accordance with the law. After continuous and effective crackdowns, 2,317 suspects of telecommunications and cyber fraud in northern Myanmar have been successfully captured and handed over to us, including 23 behind-the-scenes &quot;financiers&quot;, organizational leaders and backbones, and 94 online fugitives, a powerful squeeze This has reduced the living space for overseas fraudsters, and the number of telecom network fraud cases across the country has recently shown a significant downward trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the public security agency stated that the telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar mainly involve fraud types such as bill rebates, fake online investment and financial management, fake reseller logistics customer service, fake online loans, etc. The general public is advised to be careful Be vigilant, enhance your ability to detect and prevent fraud, and beware of being deceived. The public security organs will continue to keep a close eye on telecom network fraud criminal groups in northern Myanmar, continue to deepen border police cooperation, continue to organize special crackdown operations, make every effort to clear out fraud dens, arrest fraud personnel in accordance with the law, continue to expand the results of operations, and resolutely protect the people. Property security and legal rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以冲突再起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258274]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On October 7, Palestinian armed groups in the Gaza Strip launched a large-scale rocket attack into Israel.

I wrote an article about an interview with a girl who quoted a poem called &quot;The Book of Songs: Biyang&quot; to express her desire to work hard. But there is no poem called &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; in the &quot;Book of Songs&quot;. The forged poem is all homophones. It is written in seemingly elegant words, but when read out it is full of swear words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This editor has probably not done any real interviews or face-to-face conversations. The swearing in this poem is so obvious that you can hear it right away. However, if you think of looking for materials in the Book of Songs, this idea is correct. The function of the &quot;Ode&quot; part in &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; is traditionally believed to be &quot;to describe the beauty and virtue, and to report success to the gods&quot;. Although the gods no longer believe in them today, the Book of Songs is still the highest example of how to declare success, speak solemnly but not rigidly, and be elegant but not pretentious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, although &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; is fake, and it only plays homophonic jokes, it is not considered clever, and it is &quot;joking and sadizing&quot;. But the poem seems to mean one thing, but actually it means another thing. It is also within the cultural context represented by the Book of Songs. There are so-called &quot;changing style&quot; and &quot;changing elegance&quot; in &quot;The Book of Songs&quot;, which pays great attention to this technique. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Daya·Dang&quot; repeatedly emphasized that &quot;King Wen said that he would consult his daughter Yin Shang.&quot; King Wen of Zhou couldn&#39;t help but sigh. What he sighed was the fate of the Shang Dynasty, and then he mentioned Shang Zhou in the poem. The various atrocities committed by the king were listed in detail and criticized repeatedly. The last sentence of the poem is the famous &quot;Yin Jian is not far away, in the time of Queen Xia&quot;. Shang Zhou wanted to know his own ending, and the mirror was at hand, it was Xia Jie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people have always emphasized that Shang Zhou was vilified by the Zhou people. The reason is that subsequent dynasties must vilify the previous dynasty&#39;s subjugated king, otherwise it will not be enough to establish their own legitimacy. It cannot be said that this reason does not exist, but the poem &quot;Dang&quot; was obviously not written for this purpose. This poem was written during the Western Zhou Dynasty. The author was clearly criticizing Shang Zhou, but his actual intention was to criticize King Li of Zhou. Firstly, the artillery fire was not directed at King Li of Zhou Dynasty, but was rebounded by Shang Zhou; secondly, it was not the poet who fired the artillery fire like this, but King Wen of Zhou Dynasty. The foundation of this dynasty was created by King Wen. As a descendant of King Wen, can you still oppose him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Book of Songs&quot; initiated this tradition of borrowing from the past to satirize the present. Confucius especially emphasized to his disciples that they must study &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; carefully. Naturally, later generations of Confucian scholars played this trick very well. Why did Qin Shihuang burn poems and books? Just because &quot;Poetry&quot; is indeed an excellent teaching material that reflects the past and the present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author of &quot;Dang&quot; was probably an important minister in the Western Zhou Dynasty. Traditionally, it is believed that he was Duke Zhaomu who pointed out that &quot;it is better to guard against the people&#39;s mouth than to guard against the river&quot;. At least it is reasonable. Most people can&#39;t talk about such advanced topics, but they also have a technique for venting their resentment through poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who have not read &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; have probably heard that &quot;under the sky, is it the king&#39;s land, and on the shore of the land, is it the king&#39;s ministers&quot;, and then judging based on intuition, they will also think this sentence The majestic praise comes from the official propaganda of the Western Zhou Dynasty. It cannot be ruled out that this sentence was originally propaganda. However, we can read this sentence today because the author of &quot;Xiaoya·Beishan&quot; was a small civil servant in the Zhou Dynasty. These four sentences are followed by two sentences: &quot;Doctors are not equal.&quot; , I am engaged in being an independent scholar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The six sentences strung together mean: The world is the king&#39;s land, and the land is the king&#39;s ministers. The leadership is really unfair, and the burden is heavy on me. ——Xian means more. It probably means that those who are capable work hard, and the boss assigned all the work to the author. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following section of &quot;Beishan&quot; elaborates on how uneven the work of this department is: some people &quot;sleep in bed&quot;, which is a more elegant way of saying &quot;lying down&quot;; some people &quot;don&#39;t know how to call&quot; , no matter how miserable the people are, it’s none of my business, I’ll just do it if I can; some people are “Qi Chi Yan Yang” and will definitely be late for work and will definitely leave early after work; some people are “Zhan Le Drinker” and indulge in drinking and having fun; &quot;Come in and out of the discussion&quot;, and the reason for going to work is to talk loudly. If there are more people like this, the work will naturally be particularly miserable. He &quot;does not do anything extravagantly&quot; and is &quot;miserably afraid of blame.&quot; The more he does, the more blame he will bear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This poem pursues the effect of a majestic slogan that seamlessly connects with the fly camp and the dog dog below. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you turn two pages back in &quot;Beishan&quot;, you will read another song called &quot;Xiao Ming&quot;. ——There is a poem in &quot;The Book of Songs·Daya&quot;, the first sentence is &quot;Mingming is down&quot;, and there is a poem in &quot;Xiaoya&quot;, the first sentence is &quot;Mingming is going to heaven&quot;. So the song in &quot;Daya&quot; is called &quot;Da Ming&quot;, and the song in &quot;Xiao Ya&quot; is called &quot;Xiao Ming&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Ming said: &quot;I have passed away in the past, and the sun and the moon are gone. Will the clouds return? There will be no clouds in the year.&quot; I came to work after the Chinese New Year. When can I go home? In the blink of an eye, It&#39;s the end of the year. &quot;I miss me alone, and I am a common man. I am worried and worried that I will not have enough time.&quot; I miss me alone, and the more things I do, the more busy I am. I feel really sad, and I am afraid that I will never be able to finish my work. &quot;Thinking of our common people, caring deeply for them! Don&#39;t you want to return home? I&#39;m afraid of the punishment and anger.&quot; I miss my family, I really do. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to return home? I&#39;m afraid of this wrath.&quot; Does it mean that I don&#39;t want to go home? I&#39;m afraid of being scolded by my boss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last chapter of &quot;Xiao Ming&quot; especially demonstrates the skill of converting grievances into official language:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sigh, gentlemen, I will never rest in peace.&quot; In fact, it is talking about you stewards Yeah, don&#39;t get too comfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Jing shares your position&quot;, please stay in your position. The implication is that when I report the work and ask you to make a decision, don&#39;t be unable to find someone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The good thing is integrity.&quot; You have to be an upright person. In fact, it means being a kind person and approving what should be approved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;God listens to you, and you will be blessed.&quot; God is also watching you. Don&#39;t make things difficult for others, and you will be rewarded with blessings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, after more than two thousand years, Xiao Ming is still Xiao Ming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国光大集团原党委书记、董事长李晓鹏被“双开”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258279]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 10:07:33&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;With the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission investigated Li Xiaopeng, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Everbright Group Co., Ltd.

However, on September 22, the environmental organization Institute for the Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) released &quot;Suspicious Clouds about the Carbon Neutrality of Apple Products&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Suspicious Clouds&quot;), questioning Apple&#39;s lack of information on the use of clean electricity and carbon offsets for carbon-neutral products. Adequate disclosure and explanation, and failure to push suppliers to disclose factory-level carbon data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, Apple responded to Southern Weekend reporters, promising to share strategies and progress, and responded to some details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;carbon neutral&quot; label has been controversial for a long time. Carbon neutrality simply means that greenhouse gas emissions can be offset. After companies save energy and reduce emissions themselves, they often offset carbon emissions by purchasing “carbon credits” (such as forest carbon sinks). However, recently Nestlé, Gucci, easyJet and other companies have announced their withdrawal from the carbon offset market, and the third-party consulting company Carbon Trust will no longer provide carbon neutral label certification from September 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the controversy is the increasingly common practice of &quot;greenwashing&quot; - companies exaggerating their environmental protection behavior and misleading consumers into believing it is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To prevent greenwashing, many interviewees told Southern Weekend reporters that the key is &quot;openness.&quot; However, there is currently no consensus on the granularity of carbon neutral product information disclosure, and standards need to be unified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Europe has taken the lead. France has put forward mandatory information disclosure requirements for “carbon neutrality”-related publicity. The EU reached a provisional political agreement on September 19, 2023. If it cannot provide proof, &quot;climate neutral&quot;, &quot;nature&#39;s friend&quot;, &quot;biodegradable&quot; and &quot;ecological&quot; Eco)&quot; and other labels will be prohibited. If passed, this agreement will take effect in 2026. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The six industry insiders interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters had relatively consistent views. They both affirmed that Apple’s information disclosure on its first carbon-neutral product is remarkable, and at the same time believed that there is room for improvement. Regarding IPE’s doubts, half of the respondents agreed that Apple needs to further disclose information on clean electricity use and carbon offsets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Apple’s level of data management and disclosure of suppliers leads the world, but it still needs to fully prove whether it has gone all out to achieve product carbon neutrality.” Founder of Climate Futures, &quot;Carbon Neutral&quot; &quot;Times&quot; author Wang Jun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/jM1wpQhW07Op9WGsVGUG1fvHbtcFiggO5v2c38y6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/jM1wpQhW07Op9WGsVGUG1fvHbtcFiggO5v2c38y6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253292&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 12, 2023 local time, the new Apple Watch was on display in California, USA. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What the first carbon neutral product disclosed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;How does Apple Watch become carbon neutral? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year of announcing that its products were carbon neutral, Apple played a creative advertisement called &quot;Mother Nature&quot; at the press conference and on social platforms - Apple CEO Cook and others paid tribute to &quot;Mother Nature&quot; &quot;Mother&quot; reported on environmental protection work. The environmental report of the latest product was also published on the official website, disclosing the carbon footprint of the carbon-neutral Apple Watch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the carbon-neutral model of Apple Watch Ultra 2 as an example: the baseline carbon emission is 63.2kg, and after the carbon emission is reduced by 81%, it is reduced to 12kg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;81% of carbon reduction starts from materials, electricity, transportation and other aspects: the weight of recycled materials accounts for more than 30%; 100% clean electricity is used; 50% and above product logistics are transported by non-air transport. The remaining 12kg of emissions are offset using carbon credits from the Restore Fund project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/hPC956MeD0XOs6ChYcF3UQgWM84eRnMypDAreBcP.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;928&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/hPC956MeD0XOs6ChYcF3UQgWM84eRnMypDAreBcP.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Carbon emission data of Apple Watch Ultra 2 carbon neutral model. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Apple official website, IPE compilation/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter learned from Apple that after drastically reducing product emissions, Apple has to deal with the current situation. High-quality carbon credits based on nature projects will only be used where solutions cannot yet avoid or reduce emissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Han, director of the ESG Center at the China Business School of the University of Hong Kong, told Southern Weekend reporters that Apple has adopted a clear and strict product carbon reduction method, giving priority to reducing the three largest emission sources in the product life cycle - electricity, Materials and Shipping. But he also suggested that Apple could refer to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) requirements for setting corporate net-zero standards, carry out the product carbon neutrality process, and strive to achieve a carbon reduction of no less than 90%. emissions, and then look for ways to offset carbon emissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among various global initiatives related to combating climate change, SBTi is known for its strictness and is consistent with the Paris Agreement&#39;s efforts to achieve a temperature control path of 1.5°C&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/258230&quot;>;&quot;More than 100 companies have been &quot;publicly delisted&quot;. How difficult is it to scientifically reduce carbon emissions? ?》&lt;/a>;)&lt;/span>;. Southern Weekend reporters found out that Apple has also joined SBTi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;81% mentioned that 90% is not without space. Wang Jun told Southern Weekend reporters that although Apple explained its progress in reducing emissions in materials, electricity, and transportation, it lacked comparison with its peers and failed to demonstrate whether it had reached its own emission reduction limits, such as 50% non-air transport. Logistics and 30% recycled materials, why can’t the ratio be higher? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to prove&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;100%&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;use of clean electricity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Apple’s carbon emission reduction path, Clean electricity contributes the most. How to confirm that 100% clean electricity is used in the production process of Apple products is the first question of &quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data collected by IPE through different channels show that some of Apple’s suppliers’ carbon emissions have only declined slightly, while some are even still growing. &quot;Suspicion&quot; raised concerns that the proportion of clean electricity actually used by these suppliers is very limited, resulting in double-counting - claiming to allocate clean electricity to Apple, but actually allocating it to other brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xun, chief sustainability expert of Quantis, an environmental sustainability consulting company, also believes that the supply chain of electronic products involves multiple layers of suppliers, and it is relatively easy to require first-tier suppliers, but second- to fourth-tier suppliers Suppliers are difficult to control. Without disclosing the proportion of renewable energy, it is difficult to prove that suppliers at all levels use 100% clean electricity to produce Apple products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Southern Weekend reporters learned from Apple that Apple closely monitors, reviews and verifies the data submitted by suppliers every year, and hires a third party to conduct independent reviews of suppliers’ clean energy plan methods to track and verify suppliers’ clean energy contributions and provide assurance on reported data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to interview questions such as double counting, SCS Global Services (hereinafter referred to as SCS), a third-party company that provides carbon neutrality certification for Apple, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;We will not provide non-public information about our customers to the media. information&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot; also believes that according to data disclosed by Apple, 24% of the more than 250 suppliers that have committed to using renewable electricity to produce Apple products are unable to purchase through on-site renewable electricity or renewable energy. To achieve clean electricity substitution, you need to purchase renewable energy certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun, founder of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), said that the use and procurement of clean electricity in foundries is quite complicated. Many of them are not directly connected to renewable energy, but through the purchase of green power or green certificates. Achieve carbon emission reductions. In this case, how to distribute the limited green power among its different product lines becomes the key. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple responded to a Southern Weekend reporter saying that newly committed suppliers will need some time to obtain clean energy solutions, so some of the clean energy already committed in the Apple Watch supply chain has not yet been put into operation. In the interim, Apple has used its own renewable energy projects to close the gap, reducing the electricity footprint of manufacturing the Apple Watch to zero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/oPvV6ckNV7gVCA15OIB0hUt2r2x56wnMeiu6J5MY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/oPvV6ckNV7gVCA15OIB0hUt2r2x56wnMeiu6J5MY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253295&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 27, 2023, local time, Denmark, Apple CEO Tim Cook (right) and Apple&#39;s head of sustainability Lisa Jackson (middle), CEO of European Energy Company Erik Anderse, behind the solar panels that power Apple&#39;s data centers in Europe. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Concentrate resources on one product line&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Suppliers often serve multiple customers.

The reduction instead of increase made Ma Jun suspicious: &quot;Theoretically, by concentrating indicators and resources such as clean electricity on one product line, it is possible for niche products to achieve carbon neutrality faster.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Apple emphasized to Southern Weekend reporters that there is no pinching problem and that the power allocated to iPhone or other products is not used for Apple Watch. iPhone 15 Pro reduces emissions by 28% compared to the baseline, with most of the reduction coming from renewable energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Apple did not clearly respond to why the carbon footprint of iPhone 15 Pro is larger than that of iPhone 14 Pro. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from industry insiders that it takes time for renewable energy projects to be put into operation, which may be reflected in the ups and downs of the carbon footprint of individual links. Apple&#39;s &quot;2023 Environmental Progress Report&quot; shows that total emissions in fiscal year 2022 decreased by 2.6 million tons compared with the previous fiscal year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun believes that in order to avoid &quot;digital transport&quot; carbon neutrality, Apple needs to disclose more information for verification. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Details of the carbon offset project are to be announced&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot; mentioned that Apple&#39;s information disclosure on carbon offsets is not transparent enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Apple stated in the Apple Watch Ultra 2 carbon neutral product environmental report that the remaining 12kg after emission reductions were offset using high-quality carbon credits from the Restore Fund project. However, no details were given on the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple&#39;s &quot;2023 Environmental Progress Report&quot; released in April 2023 shows that the Restore Fund will be jointly launched by Apple, Conservation International and Goldman Sachs in 2021. The focus of the first phase is Cultivate sustainably managed forests and generate high-quality carbon emissions rights. Key projects include the restoration and protection of high-quality production forests and native ecosystems in Paraguay and Brazil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going to a distant place to buy the carbon sequestration of a forest, how to ensure that the forest will not be cut down, burned by wildfires or double counted?

Shi Han believes that Apple’s first carbon-neutral product report did not disclose the specific details of the carbon offset projects it used, such as project type, location, quantity and price. This makes it difficult for outsiders to assess the quality and effectiveness of its carbon offsets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters obtained six carbon neutrality certificates for Apple Watch straps and watches from SCS. The certificates show the carbon emissions, carbon offset quantity, and reference of each product. The internationally recognized SCS-108 and ISO14067 carbon neutral certification standards, but do not include specific information on carbon offsets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; SCS Vice President of Marketing Karen Righthand and Apple confirmed to Southern Weekend that the above certificates can be made public, and the public can check them later on Apple’s official website and in Apple’s annual environmental progress report the year after the product is released. On October 6, the SCS green certification product platform launched certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/5kGm4JJ1bSIjPJm0bfUoKqIF4f7p3fWviLERgMgJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;732&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/5kGm4JJ1bSIjPJm0bfUoKqIF4f7p3fWviLERgMgJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253293&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Carbon Neutral Certificate of Apple Watch Ultra2 (with Alpine Loop Style). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(SCS/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that specific information on carbon credits is usually made public after the project is completed. At present, the Restore Fund carbon credit project corresponding to Apple Watch carbon-neutral products may not have ended yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the appendix page of Apple&#39;s &quot;2023 Environmental Progress Report&quot;, you can find information on two carbon offset projects used to offset Apple&#39;s 2022 corporate operational emissions footprint, namely Alto in the Peruvian Amazon. The Mayo Forest Conservation Project and the REDD+ project in the Kaiuru Mountains region in southeastern Kenya include a basic description of the project, year, repayment amount, and the project&#39;s registration link with Verra, a third-party carbon credit verification agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Restore Fund, you can currently check the location, planning, start time and other specific information of a completed project - Forestal Apepu on the Verra official website. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun said that Apple’s response to demands and disclosure of carbon neutrality certificates to the public is a step worthy of recognition. However, the current carbon neutral certificates still lack specific information on carbon credits. Now that carbon neutral products have been promoted and marketed, more detailed information on carbon offset projects should be disclosed to the public in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot; cited the PAS2060 carbon neutrality standard issued by the British Standards Institute (BSI). When companies submit applications for carbon neutrality verification to verification agencies, they should submit the amount, type, and issuance time of carbon offsets. , validity period, cancellation date, etc. Although the PAS2060 standard does not require companies to disclose the above information to the public, Ma Jun believes that there is currently a lot of controversy over carbon-neutral products internationally, and it is necessary to review and improve the current standards, improve data disclosure requirements, and build a publicly verifiable chain of evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Data Disclosure&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Granularity&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Dispute&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun believes that the best way to resolve disputes is The way is to fully disclose carbon data to society. However, &quot;Suspicion&quot; pointed out that Apple &quot;has regressed in its position on environmental information disclosure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2014, IPE has successively launched the &quot;Green Supply Chain CITI Index&quot; and &quot;Corporate Climate Action CATI Index&quot; to evaluate the environmental management performance of brands in China&#39;s supply chain. Apple has ranked among the best for many years in a row, becoming a CITI &quot;Outstanding Brand&quot; &quot;one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, the IPE carbon disclosure platform will be officially launched. Companies need to change the way they submit carbon data. IPE has repeatedly confirmed with Apple about changes in its disclosure policy, hoping that Apple will push suppliers to fill in the disclosure form, and Apple told IPE that “suppliers will not be required to disclose factory-level carbon data to the public.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this, IPE suspects that Apple has &quot;regressed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple has had several rounds of communication with IPE. &quot;Suspicion&quot; published Apple&#39;s email in response to IPE. Apple stated that &quot;there has been no regression in the requirement for suppliers to report carbon emissions to Apple&quot; and &quot;we continue to encourage suppliers. Publicly disclose its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, participate in IPE’s initiatives, and advocate for transparency.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from various sources that both IPE and Apple support the disclosure of carbon data by suppliers. The difference lies in the granularity of disclosure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IPE encourages companies to disclose factory-level data. &quot;Some supplier groups have many factories, and some are even distributed around the world. If we only publish data at the supplier group level, it cannot be mapped to specific factories, and we cannot clearly judge the emission reduction progress of actual OEM factories.&quot; Ma Jun explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple encourages suppliers to disclose carbon data at the company level rather than at the factory level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple responded to a Southern Weekend reporter saying that the most impactful action suppliers can take to combat climate change is to transition to renewable energy. Because this positive impact (of supplier access to renewable energy) spans regions and potentially many plant sites, it is best measured at the company level, with renewable projects additive and localized to the same grid where manufacturing operations occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;factory level&quot; data also involves disputes over whether it is a trade secret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Weijia, general manager of Guangzhou Jie Carbon Technology Co., Ltd., a comprehensive dual-carbon service provider, told Southern Weekend reporters that carbon data is associated with many core confidential data, and companies have the right to disclose and share such data. There are also trade-offs necessary, and gaps in some data are understandable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If only third-party organizations can obtain and verify corporate carbon-neutral product data, it will be difficult for other relevant parties to verify it. Ma Jun believes that in the process of promoting carbon-neutral products, Apple should not &quot;outsource&quot; its disclosure responsibilities to third-party organizations that do not have the right to disclose. Unless a third-party organization is authorized to disclose on its behalf, &quot;pollution and carbon emission data should not be Classified as commercial secrets, disclosure is the principle and non-disclosure should only be the exception. The starting point to curb climate greenwashing must be, and can only be, comprehensive and complete information disclosure. At a time when the concept of carbon neutrality is widely controversial, we hope Seeing publicly proven carbon neutral products emerge on the market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“What needs to be acknowledged is that the current basis and standards for accurate inventory of manufacturing carbon emission data are still not rigorous and complete enough. It is normal to be questioned, and doubts will also help promote the development and progress of the entire carbon industry. Guan Weijia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Should we first create a carbon-neutral product? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is also controversial whether to first create a carbon-neutral product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Han believes that choosing a product to achieve carbon neutrality throughout the life cycle is a key start for companies to gradually achieve carbon neutrality for all products. But he also pointed out that when consumers buy Apple Watch, they may not know which combinations are carbon neutral - because only when they choose a specific watch and strap combination can they meet the requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jun also holds a similar view. Through the carbon neutrality pilot demonstration of Apple Watch, Apple can run through the process and help achieve the goal of carbon neutrality for all products in 2030. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xun opposed it. He believes that there is nothing wrong with running through the internal process, but it is not appropriate to market the concept of &quot;product carbon neutrality&quot; at this stage. Carbon neutrality practices by companies are completely different from promoting carbon neutrality in products. The former is an action taken by companies out of social responsibility, while the latter is a market behavior directly facing consumers. “When carbon neutrality standards have not yet been perfected, companies Self-declared carbon neutrality has no practical significance and will face the risk of &#39;greenwashing&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马军表示，碳中和的标签在国际上存在争议，为此一些利益方已着手制定更加严格的要求。在相关标准需要完善的条件下，给产品贴上碳中和标签的企业，有责任通过全面的信息披露，来支撑绿色营销，以免误导消费者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;苹果碳中和绿色标识是五片醒目的绿色树叶，但也有企业表示放弃碳中和的标签。比如2023年5月，依云在其网站上发布消息称，依云对其获得的碳信托认证感到自豪，但不会寻求全球范围内的再认证。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月，碳信托也宣布不再提供碳中和标签认证。碳信托总部位于英国，有超过20年的咨询和认证经验，曾在2007年发布全球首个基于产品碳足迹认证的碳标签。碳信托中国区总裁赵立建告诉南方周末记者，“碳中和标签在全球依然有很高的需求，取消碳中和标签并非因为依云或其他公司不再继续使用”，而是因为“市场在不断地发展，需要提供更具雄心的碳标签来配合”。更新标签已经过深思熟虑，并非仓促取消。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵立建称，消费者希望企业采取更积极而透明的气候行动，碳信托更新后的碳标签不再强调碳中和，避免消费者误以为产品没有碳排放或零排放，而是重点关注碳减排和产品碳足迹比较。比如减碳标签会展示通过减排措施，产品碳足迹比以前减排了多少；低碳标签会列举：此产品的碳排放较同公司类似产品更低；或此产品的碳排放较市场上同类产品更低。标签还通过网址/二维码展示更全面的信息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们应该更谦逊地面对碳中和问题，认识到圆满达成碳中和背后的复杂性，正视其中的困难。”马军说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[钱伟长 最厉害的偏科生丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258236]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[把家庭财产、公司财产洗为个人财产？拆解三种洗钱类型]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258204]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-08 23:45:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Beijing TV station&#39;s &quot;Rule of Law in Progress&quot; column reported such a case, from free to high fees, over the New Year Ms. Chen, who was in her sixties, couldn&#39;t help being &quot;fooled&quot; again and again in a medical beauty institution in Haidian District, Beijing. She made 370 transfers in just 10 months, spending a total of 5.44 million yuan on beauty care, and even some The consumption in a single day reached 790,000 yuan, which consumed all the family’s savings and the life-saving money of my wife and children. The news triggered heated discussions, with some netizens asking, &quot;Is such an abnormal move suspected of transferring family assets?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the report, on the one hand, the medical beauty institution first claimed that it was free, and then gradually Ms. Chen introduced a fee-based item, and the sales consultant even said that he could &quot;help advance payment&quot; of part of the expenses and was unable to provide relevant medical records. This was indeed a violation of regulations. However, on the other hand, Ms. Chen knew that her husband was suffering from cancer, so she actually transferred the medical expenses and the entire family&#39;s expenses. He invested all his savings into it, but his behavior is also strange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The money at home cannot be used by either spouse as they wish. In 2022, the People&#39;s Court of Fangshan District, Beijing heard a divorce case. My wife loves beauty and other high-end purchases, and has squandered all the family savings of 600,000 yuan. After trial, the court held that the 600,000 yuan deposit involved in the case was the husband and wife&#39;s business income and was the joint property of the husband and wife. Both spouses have equal rights to dispose of common property, but when exercising the right to dispose of common property, one spouse should adhere to the principles of moderation, rationality and prudence, use it reasonably and standardizedly, and must not be squandered or damage the property rights of the spouse. In this case, the court protected the part where the wife exercised her right of reasonable disposal. The part where excessive consumption was done without the consent of the spouse, was not for the purpose of daily household expenses, and was squandering, which infringed upon the property rights of the spouse. In the end, the court ruled that the woman should pay her ex-husband 200,000 yuan in compensation for her deposit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on this reasoning, Ms. Chen spent more than 5 million yuan in family savings and her husband’s medical expenses on “exorbitantly expensive beauty treatments”, which is also suspected of harming her husband’s property rights. It is worth noting that the above report also mentioned a detail, &quot;The medical beauty institution gave a consumption details. Among them, there are many discrepancies between the total consumption amount, consumption records and the transfer details transferred by the bank.&quot; The actual expenditure It is inconsistent with the accounts. Are the relevant funds used for beauty expenses, or are they transferring family assets in the name of beauty? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As relevant departments intensify their publicity on &quot;anti-money laundering&quot;, the public has become aware of its concept. Money laundering is essentially the act of disguising, concealing, and transforming illegal assets or other assets that do not belong to individuals in various ways to make them legal in form. It can be roughly divided into three types: laundering family assets into personal assets, Criminal gangs or corrupt officials use their money to launder and turn company assets into their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the above-mentioned &quot;sky-high price beauty&quot; case, the onlookers lamented the greed and foolishness of the person involved in &quot;spending thousands of dollars for beauty&quot;. Perhaps some people&#39;s abnormal behavior is just in response to the old saying &quot;Others laugh at me for being crazy, but I laugh at others because they can&#39;t see through it.&quot; In the name of large consumption, they convert family property into personal property. Once the subsequent marriage relationship changes, , and preparations are made for property cutting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many ways to &quot;launder&quot; family assets into personal assets. For example, use the joint funds of the couple to buy valuable jewelry and put it in their own names; regularly give a large amount of &quot;red envelopes&quot; to their parents, and then ask their parents to transfer the money into their own accounts; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The whitewashing of funds with unknown future is common among corrupt officials, criminal gangs, etc. Corrupt officials clean up their corruption gains by investing in companies, purchasing art, and even regularly giving their children huge amounts of living expenses. Public officials use overseas companies to inflate the import price when importing equipment and raw materials, then receive huge kickbacks from them, and then keep the illegal gains abroad. This not only makes public funds their own, but also realizes the transfer of assets overseas. . Public officials can also use &quot;white gloves&quot; to set up shell companies to invest overseas, that is, first set up shell companies abroad, then use their powers to provide various conveniences, and finally remit domestic income abroad in the form of overseas investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Criminal gangs launder illegal gains into legitimate gains through investment in film and television dramas, virtual currency transactions, etc. There are criminal gangs that are linked to casinos, convert cash into tokens in casinos, and then deliver the tokens directly to the beneficiaries of the money laundering. Then he will exchange the tokens back into cash (usually requiring a handling fee of about 5%), and he can claim to have won the money by gambling in the casino. This avoids directly tracing the beneficiary of money laundering through the serial number on the banknote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the above two methods of money laundering, rich people complete the transfer of company assets to personal assets by purchasing overseas bonds issued by their own companies abroad and then using their authority to pay them first. For example, a company may be in debt due to poor business operations and face bankruptcy. As the actual controller of the company, the rich people let the company issue US dollar bonds with annual interest rates as high as ten percent or even higher, and then the rich people subscribed in large quantities. In this way, the rich man, as the actual controller of the company, theoretically only has limited liability within the scope of equity. It is the company&#39;s business to pay off its debts. In this way, through &quot;due process&quot;, the company was hollowed out, Jin Chan escaped from the shell, converted the company&#39;s assets into personal assets, and then took his family and children to enjoy the rest of his life abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子持刀列车上杀人，广铁集团通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258276]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;After review by judicial authorities, it was found that on the evening of May 4, passenger He used a black folding knife (blade) About 10.5 cm long) was hidden behind a belt buckle.

Even so, the attack on October 7 took many people by surprise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I started hearing the sound of artillery shells being fired around 6 a.m. on the 7th, and it lasted for several hours.” Zhang Feng said, “This time the sound was particularly dense. It was like boom, boom, boom. The sound was different. It was like setting off firecrackers during the New Year, dozens of them were fired at once.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the attack, the three-story apartment building where he and his colleagues lived was &quot;almost empty,&quot; and many Local people drove their families to the air raid shelters for safety. Compared with bullet shelters in apartments, air raid shelters are stronger and safer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the attack on the morning of the 7th, Zhang Feng and his colleagues were still discussing how to go to work in the restaurant. Looking out the window, the usually crowded lanes are becoming deserted. However, they soon received a holiday notice from the restaurant headquarters, &quot;No need to go to work, no need to go out.&quot; In order to explain the situation clearly, the headquarters specially arranged a translator who knew Chinese to explain it word for word during the voice call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This time is really amazing, different from before.&quot; Zhang Feng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;big battle&quot; Zhang Feng felt was a &quot;rare&quot; moment experienced by this region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israeli military claimed that on the morning of the 7th, Hamas fired about 2,200 rockets from the Gaza Strip to attack Israel, and armed gunmen also crossed the border and launched ground attacks in southern Israel. For a time, air defense sirens continued to sound in the southern and central areas of Tel Aviv, the former capital of Israel, and explosions were heard over multiple Israeli towns close to the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the Israel Defense Forces issued a statement declaring a state of war and recruiting tens of thousands of reservists to launch attacks on multiple Hamas targets in Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sudden escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict shocked the world. On the 7th, many Western countries, led by the United States, condemned Hamas for launching a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; on Israel, while many Arab countries called for an immediate ceasefire between the two sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 8, when answering a reporter’s question on the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that China is deeply concerned about the current intensification of tensions and violence between Palestine and Israel, and calls on all parties concerned to remain calm and restrained. , cease fire immediately to protect civilians and prevent the situation from deteriorating further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/GTkhYNgPyEqsEAmhI6hxnZzeInzbQ1goeFtlhDLa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;533&quot; height= &quot;877&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/GTkhYNgPyEqsEAmhI6hxnZzeInzbQ1goeFtlhDLa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253442&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After the explosion, the ground was in a mess. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Israel was unprepared”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After a day of fighting between Palestine and Israel, the number of casualties has exceeded 3,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Palestinian health department on the 7th, the Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip have killed 232 local people and injured about 1,700 people. According to a statement from the Israeli Ministry of Defense on the evening of the 7th, various attacks that day killed more than 200 people and injured more than 1,000 people in Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this raid, Israel, known for its intelligence and military strength, acted passively, triggering a lot of speculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It is difficult to describe how unprecedented today’s situation is.” The BBC reported on October 7 that this may be Israel’s “most serious intelligence failure” since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. It has the most powerful intelligence agency in the Middle East, but there was no early warning of the attack that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the US &quot;Capitol Hill&quot; news on October 7, former US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper bluntly stated in an interview with US media that Hamas&#39;s attack was &quot;surprising and made Israel &quot;There was no preparedness on the part of the Israeli side,&quot; he said, adding that this was an intelligence error on the part of Israel. He also believes that Israel’s mistakes will trigger chain reactions in many aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, in the first round of attacks by Hamas, Israel has been quite &quot;slow&quot; in its response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to rocket attacks, videos released by Hamas showed that Hamas armed personnel were heavily armed and used homemade simple gliders to infiltrate into Israel. Videos and pictures that appeared on social media showed Hamas militants also entering Israeli-controlled areas in pickup trucks and motorcycles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 7, local time, the Qassam Brigades, an armed faction affiliated with Hamas, issued a statement saying that dozens of Israeli officers and soldiers were captured during military operations that day. The men are currently being housed in a &quot;safe location.&quot; This news was also confirmed by the Times of Israel report. The media quoted Israeli military sources as saying that &quot;soldiers and civilians were indeed captured by Hamas and kidnapped to the Gaza Strip.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Israel&#39;s &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot;, photos released by Hamas show that its armed men captured Israeli Major General Nimrod Aloni and many other Israeli soldiers. It is reported that Aloni served as the commander of the Israeli Army&#39;s &quot;Gaza Division&quot; and the commander of the &quot;Depth&quot; force. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She Gangzheng believes that Israel has been in a state of guarding against surprise attacks for a long time, and the relative stability in recent years can easily lead to laziness and paralysis. This sudden large-scale attack by Hamas caught Israel by surprise. In addition, Israel has fallen into political chaos in recent years and has long lacked leading power. The judicial reform led by the Netanyahu government has further paralyzed the original political consensus, and all parties are busy fighting among themselves. This is also one of the factors behind Israel’s slow intelligence and military response this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of the 7th local time, the Israeli Political and Security Cabinet held a meeting. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated in a statement that Israel’s goal is to “eliminate Hamas’ threat to and harm to Israel for many years to come. the capabilities and desires of citizens”. He also added, &quot;The decisions taken by the cabinet include stopping the supply of electricity, fuel and commodities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We have started offensive mode and will continue without reservation and without breath until the goal is achieved .&quot; Netanyahu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;16 years&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;open-air prison&quot; under blockade&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;According to CNN, Hamas military commander Mohammed Dave said on October 7 that the operation was in response to Israel’s “attacks on women, the desecration of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and the The ongoing siege of Gaza.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The so-called &#39;reasons for action&#39; put forward by Hamas, although relevant incidents did occur, are more of a rhetoric to defend the legitimacy of its actions. However, Israel&#39;s blockade and siege of Gaza This has been one of the deep-seated conflicts between Hamas and the Israeli authorities for a long time,&quot; She Gangzheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops in 2005, Gaza has become the Palestinian sphere of influence. Since 2007, Israel has regarded Hamas, which controls the area, as a major security threat, and has begun to implement a comprehensive sea, land and air blockade of the Gaza Strip, with strict restrictions on the entry and exit of goods and personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, incoming and outgoing goods are subject to security inspections, personnel need to hold a permit to enter and exit, and fishing areas accurate to kilometers are set up in coastal areas. In order to prevent the construction of military facilities, Israel once banned any steel bars, cement and other materials from entering Gaza. It was not until 2010 that Israel narrowed the list of prohibited items to &quot;weapons and materials for military use.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since the implementation of the blockade, Israel has claimed that it will not let Hamas obtain any weapons. But judging from the results, despite spending a lot of manpower and material resources, Hamas still has various channels to import weapons .&quot; She Gangzheng believes that since Israel&#39;s unilateral withdrawal in 2005, the Gaza area has been basically blocked by Israel, showing a stable and continuous state. On the one hand, Israel provides corresponding support to the Gaza Strip, such as electricity supply, allowing some Palestinians to enter the country to work, and releasing humanitarian relief supplies. On the other hand, millions of Palestinians are confined to this small area, where people&#39;s lives are restricted and often subject to humanitarian criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public information, the current population of the Gaza Strip exceeds 2 million, which is approximately one-fifth of Israel’s total population, but the area is less than one percent of Israel’s land. The Gaza Strip is small and densely populated. The blockade has hindered the development of the Gaza region. People&#39;s daily life, health system, and infrastructure have gradually deteriorated. A large number of residents rely on relief from international organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Israel&#39;s comprehensive blockade, the Gaza Strip has become an isolated &quot;enclave.&quot; Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas once described the Gaza Strip as a giant &quot;prison.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 7, local time, Israeli Energy Minister Katz announced that in response to the conflict, he had signed an order requiring the Israeli Electric Power Company to cut off power supply to the Gaza Strip. It is understood that about two-thirds of the electricity in the Gaza Strip depends on Israeli supply. Israel&#39;s announcement of &quot;cutting off supply&quot; is likely to further exacerbate the energy dilemma in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Fan Hongda from the Institute of Middle East Studies at Shanghai International Studies University believes that as long as the Palestinian issue cannot be properly resolved and as long as Israel&#39;s current position on this issue does not change, conflict between the two sides will be inevitable. Hamas may launch similar operations at any time it sees fit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fan Hongda also pointed out that this conflict is significantly different from the past conflicts. The Gaza armed forces have entered Israel and captured some Israeli hostages, including soldiers, which will bring consequences to the Israeli people. A real sense of fear. Next, Israel will intensify its attacks on the Gaza armed forces, and it will be a heavier blow than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It is foreseeable that the situation of the people in the Gaza Strip will be even more difficult in the future.&quot; Fan Hongda said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 08 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
