(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past &quot;May Day&quot; and the approaching &quot;National Day&quot;, Dr. Sun from the emergency department of Zibo Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital went on two missions during two consecutive long holidays. In order to protect people from all over the country who came to Zi for barbecue, as a member of the city&#39;s medical security team, he stayed on duty at the makeshift barbecue city for several days during the May Day holiday. The constant flow of people made him, an &quot;Old Zibo&quot;, feel unreal. The outside world kept saying that it was going to be cold, but it was always crowded every time he passed by the popular barbecue spot Ba Daji when he went out. Just like that, half a year passed in a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this summer vacation, the streets have indeed regained some calm, but after a marathon, the streets are noisy again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There will definitely be a wave of traffic during the National Day holiday. This is what it means to hold a marathon at this time.&quot; On September 24, the last weekend before the National Day holiday, this internet celebrity city held its first marathon Marathon. Just after the game ended that day, Dr. Sun gave his prediction for the passenger flow during the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because it was held in Zibo, this marathon was nicknamed the &quot;BBQ Marathon&quot; by runners. “As soon as I heard it was the Zibo Marathon, I rushed (to sign up).” After getting off the high-speed train at noon on September 23, Feng Yanhua made an appointment with fellow runners to have a meal. They queued for an hour and a half, and many people in front of the store were carrying Marathon on their backs. The pre-game package looked like a contestant who stopped by for the tooth festival. &quot;Zibo people are very welcoming, and the barbecue is very affordable and delicious.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After several months of &quot;turbulent&quot; drama, Zibo Barbecue has experienced a fierce evolution from explosion to crazy expansion, and then to a brief period of calm. Many interviewees said that after the summer vacation, the market showed obvious signs of calming down. However, whether it will return to its original shape before the epidemic or maintain an average value of warm but not cool, people are still waiting and watching, and it is difficult to tell. Conclusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the interviewees agreed that at least during this National Day Golden Week, Zibo will still see a peak of tourists. For this reason, businesses and citizens are eager to try to seize this possible &quot;last wave of traffic.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Barbecue shop owner: Give it a try again on National Day&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The obvious &quot;turning point&quot; occurred after the summer vacation. &quot;You can see it all at a glance&quot; on Badaju Street, which is booming. The popularity of Zibo barbecue has dropped after half a year. &quot;It was still very busy in July and August, but after September, it subsided a bit quickly.&quot; Standing at the fork in the traffic flow, whether to advance or retreat, the owner of a barbecue restaurant in Zhangdian District, Zibo City was a little undecided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boss Shan’s shop was featured in the documentary &quot;A String of Life&quot;, coupled with the super popularity of &quot;Going to Zi for Barbecue&quot;, the business has been really booming for a long time. &quot;It was a bit broken at the time. There were too many people, and the whole store was spinning.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that he had hired a lot more waiters, and his salary also increased from 2,800 to 3,000, and then from 3,000 to 3,500. &quot;Salaries must not be reduced, and personnel cannot be laid off.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were too many stores, and the problem spread out. At that time, people all over the country went to Zibo, and no matter how many stores they had, they could digest it. Afterwards, the customer flow continued, but it was not as turbulent as before. Stores in poorer locations, or newer stores that were not well-known, did not even have many customers, so the wave of store openings slowed down. &quot;Newly opened stores have to hold activities, so they will have more customers, and old stores will be affected. New stores can&#39;t always hold activities, and if they don&#39;t hold events, they will have fewer customers.&quot; Boss Shan said that the Zibo barbecue industry has evolved from the previous &quot;dissuading customers&quot; to Now we need to compete on price and do fancy things to attract customers, &quot;it&#39;s starting to get rolled up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of Boss Shan’s “apprentices” resigned from his position as a bank lobby manager and joined the barbecue industry. He once doubted his choice, but persevered and caught up with the wave of traffic. He said that the barbecue industry is a low-investment, asset-light industry. After purchasing a store, it can open for business very quickly. Even so, without technology, it will still not be able to operate well. &quot;Making barbecue is very tiring, and you have to pay attention to quality.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It would also be a good thing to eliminate a number of hastily launched stores as the popularity drops. Boss Shan’s “apprentice” believes that the barbecue industry will get better and better, and he is actively stocking up to prepare for the National Day holiday. &quot;Keep your own quality and do long-term business. It&#39;s easy to open a store but difficult to maintain it. Now it&#39;s up to you to see who can endure it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I say that the heat is down, but I am very honest. Boss Shan is also planning A new store is planned to open during National Day. His judgment on the barbecue industry is that a number of stores will close down quickly and the customer flow will still remain at a high level. Therefore, taking advantage of the window period in September, he quickly decided to &quot;go against the market&quot; and expand. Coincidentally, the employees who were previously recruited do not need to be laid off and can be transferred to the new store on the spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course he is optimistic about the future market development, so he continues to bet on barbecue. More importantly, he has been doing barbecue for more than 20 years and can’t do anything else. &quot;I am in my forties. All my youth is invested in it.” At the beginning, Boss Shan called his mother and sister to work together. They worked from morning to night but could not make much money. After many years of persistence, the business started to pick up around 2014, and I slowly found my way into this industry. &quot;I get up earlier than a chicken and go to bed later than a dog. In the final analysis, I still earn hard-earned money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am just looking forward to the arrival of the National Day holiday and opening a new store. I plan to open a new store during the National Day holiday.&quot; Let&#39;s fight together.&quot; He said&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Zibo residents: Eat barbecue in the first half of the year and visit scenic spots in the second half of the year&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;I feel like I hope to continue the good impression of Zibo among the people across the country. .&quot; This Zibo Marathon is Feng Yanhua&#39;s 66th full marathon. She said that in marathons held in various places, due to the large number of applicants, qualifications often require a systematic lottery. This time, she and several friends won the lottery. Later, she learned that the organizers mainly reserved the places for out-of-towners. Although there are still many details of the event that need to be improved, runners clearly felt that Zibo left all the good things to the guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Very frank and enthusiastic, and the people here are very simple.” Feng Yanhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the Zibo Propaganda Department and the Zibo Barbecue Association to try to understand the preparations for the National Day in this Internet celebrity city, but the other parties declined the interview request. However, in the eyes of the outside world, Zibo has intentionally gradually increased its popularity. In the tweets on various platforms for this marathon, &quot;Zibo Barbecue&quot; was highlighted as a highlight of the event: &quot;Eat Zibo Barbecue, run Zibo Marathon.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he learned that his hometown had organized a marathon, Jia Yanhao, a Zibo native who was studying in Qingdao as a graduate student, realized that the government’s strategy for dealing with traffic had changed. From being inactive before and after the May Day holiday, It has even become so popular that it now actively spreads the topic. &quot;I definitely hope that the enthusiasm will last longer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During May Day, Jia Yanhao was still studying as an undergraduate. Because he couldn&#39;t get a train ticket, he didn&#39;t go home to experience the enthusiasm of the people across the country. I went back to live for a while during the summer vacation, and I still saw many foreign license plates and tour groups. In addition, he found that the government has done a lot of basic work: renovating some convenience markets, renovating municipal facilities, making roads much smoother, and streets becoming cleaner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key is that stars have come to Zibo to hold concerts, and marathons have also been held. The popularity is rising in waves, all in the relay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know whether it is intentional or God’s blessing. Since 2023, traffic has indeed favored Zibo. &quot;Because of Daolang&#39;s song, Pu Songling&#39;s former residence in Zibo has become popular again.&quot; Qi Feng is a native of Zibo, but he rarely visits these scenic spots. However, in line with the fine tradition of &quot;prioritizing outsiders&quot;, he decided to It’s better to wait until the heat subsides a little before visiting again. Unexpectedly, a friend from out of town came to visit and asked him to be a tour guide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu Songling’s former residence is located in a small village with narrow roads and inconvenient transportation. The government worked overnight to repair the road. Soon, stage plays adapted from Liaozhai stories came one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the first half of the year, I was doing receptions and having barbecues, which made me vomit. In the second half of the year, I mainly went to tourist attractions.&quot; Qi Feng said that recently, friends from out of town have been coming to Zibo one after another. She said she wanted to eat barbecue, but instead she named the ancient capital of Qi State, Liuli Museum, Pu Songling&#39;s former residence, and the Zhoucun Ancient Street where the TV series &quot;Da Ranfang&quot; was filmed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shows that the popularity of barbecue has begun to spill over to tourism projects. He felt a little relieved, but also a little regretful. &quot;After all, Zibo is not a traditional tourist city, and there are no good attractions.&quot; He explained that these attractions are relatively scattered, and they are not the kind of &quot;big-name&quot; leading scenic spots, so the tourist attraction is still limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancestors are still not strong enough, and God is not very good at receiving the rice. Qi Feng said that as an ordinary citizen, he certainly hopes that Zibo&#39;s popularity will stay as long as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Haiyue Dragon Palace BBQ experience venue on June 24, 2023. Can this grand occasion be repeated during the National Day?

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Entrepreneur: Taking over cultural and creative industries, sales of barbecue robots are bleak&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Pu Songling’s former residence became popular, Hu Changyue was not complacent about his forward-thinking vision. Instead, we need to take a serious look at this cultural out-of-circle phenomenon. &quot;Several cultural labels in Zibo have become popular in turn.&quot; He is the owner of a design company in Zibo. After Zibo barbecue became popular, his company designed a set of cultural and creative products with Zibo cultural themes. One of them is Liaozhai culture. Thinking of locking in the market demand in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Changyue said that their cultural and creative products are mainly tourist souvenirs such as fans and refrigerator magnets, and they have designed three major categories of themes: fireworks in the world, Qi culture and Liaozhai culture. At that time, the streets were full of banners saying &quot;Come to Zibo for Barbecue&quot;, and the focus was on the four words &quot;Zibo Barbecue&quot;. Therefore, the best-selling souvenirs at that time were &quot;Human Fireworks&quot;, and the theme was consistent with barbecue. , and even directly printed with the pattern of a barbecue grill, &quot;It must have the word Zibo, or the element of barbecue, to be easy to sell.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, colored glaze and calligraphy and painting became the top trend. At the small stalls on the roadside in Ba Daju, the previous purple potato cakes and wok cakes were all replaced by colored glaze handicrafts and fans with calligraphy and painting elements. . Hu Changyue didn&#39;t notice how they became popular, but they were popular anyway. &quot;This shows that the outside world is beginning to understand Zibo&#39;s culture through barbecue.&quot; He said that at this stage, the sales of Qi Culture&#39;s products soared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Pu Songling’s former residence became popular, Hu Changyue suddenly felt that God was indeed favoring Zibo, and hot topics came one after another, &quot;In fact, our government is also quite good at it. If one falls, it will catch up with them all.&quot; &quot;. As a result, their company&#39;s products completely covered all stages of Zibo&#39;s traffic curve and fought a beautiful surprise battle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave, there are also those who are frustrated and unable to get a share of the pie. &quot;I feel that my thing is too advanced, and the development of Zibo&#39;s barbecue industry has not been able to keep up.&quot; Before the epidemic, intelligent robot entrepreneur Li Guohua developed his exclusive product &quot;BBQ Robot&quot;. On May 1st in 2023 , he also applied for a booth from the government department to display and promote in the barbecue city. He thought that the opportunity had come, but he did not expect that the sales were dismal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He claimed that in 2019, he received an order from a large domestic chain restaurant giant. The company planned to create a barbecue sub-brand and asked him to provide a full set of automation transformation solutions. So he developed the barbecue robot. Unexpectedly, after three years of epidemic, the barbecue sub-brand project was scrapped, and his barbecue robot had no use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Guohua realized that compared with chain catering giants, Zibo’s barbecue industry ecosystem was still in its infancy, and the automation equipment was too advanced. The two were not well matched and could not handle Zibo’s traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Stall owners of the Eighth Bureau: Worried most about the transfer of leaders&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Li Dong, who runs a calligraphy and painting stall in the Eighth Bureau of Zibo, is not worried at all that the traffic will never return. &quot;I am very confident that Zibo has many ways and means to continue its popularity.&quot; Li Dong gave an example. The marathon is a government initiative to attract tourists to Zibo. The popular Liaozhai story not long ago can be regarded as the &quot;passive business&quot; of Pu Songling&#39;s former residence. Zibo Capture this hot spot astutely and follow the trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What I am most worried about now is the transfer of (government) leaders.&quot; Li Dong was originally a literary enthusiast who liked to write, draw, and collect. He heard that the government would set aside a part of the Eighth Bureau The stalls were provided to the public free of charge, but priority was given to culture and cultural and creative industries, so he took the initiative to apply. With his profound attainments in calligraphy and painting, he passed the review. Now, not only do I have room to display my literary and artistic talents, but I also gain a lot of income every month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A popular barbecue spot in Zibo is the Badaji Convenience Market.

Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the National Day holiday approaches, he is full of energy and ready to do something big. Taking advantage of the short off-season in September, he stepped up stocking and rushed to produce a batch of works. Moreover, when the time comes, he also plans to bring out the best products he has at the bottom of the box to dominate the scene. &quot;Large pieces of work, as well as meticulous paintings, will definitely be popular if they are brought out,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, it is closely related to his personal interests, and secondly, he is proud of being a Zibo native. He strictly demands himself, no longer running red lights when crossing the road, no longer littering when going out, and after smoking a cigarette, the cigarette butts are left behind. Be sure to find a trash can before throwing it away. &quot;Pay attention to your personal qualities. With so many outsiders looking at you, you can&#39;t discredit Zibo.&quot; He said that after the National Day, the weather gradually gets colder, and tourist attractions across the country are also in off-season, so We must take advantage of this &quot;Golden Week&quot; to do something big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before it became popular, Sister Fang opened an Italian pizza restaurant in Badaju. For dinner the day before the marathon, she hosted a local marathon runner. Sister Fang said that the purpose of foreign tourists coming to Badaju is usually very clear. The main meals are local delicacies such as barbecue or Boshan cuisine. Therefore, the business of the Italian restaurant is not directly affected. However, being in the core area, they still Received many benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a more stylish restaurant owner in Zibo, Sister Fang found that in addition to marathons, Zibo has more and more cultural attractions such as musicals and stage plays, so &quot;National Day&quot; will definitely There is a wave of tourists. However, after experiencing the baptism of &quot;May Day&quot;, she is now well-trained and does not need to be too nervous. She can just stock up normally and open the business normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, Sister Fang’s husband worked in Italy for many years. When he got older, he returned to his hometown and opened this restaurant, and the couple usually worked together to run it. The two of them decided that they would have to work hard for a few more days on National Day, and after this busy holiday, they would go out for a trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, the pizza shop was preparing to close. &quot;No matter how much money we make, we won&#39;t do anything. We want to spend the holidays with our family,&quot; said Sister Fang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[严惩环评造假，按季度对人员异常情况预警]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257756]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/8oXKTbNFgMhVHlddvU8sfkUq8kArMNfR36fFkATn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;919&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/8oXKTbNFgMhVHlddvU8sfkUq8k ArMNfR36fFkATn. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252345&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Severely punish falsification of environmental assessments, and environmental assessments with quality problems will be reported to the approval department, Assessment agency. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, crackdowns on fraud in environmental impact assessments have attracted much attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 26, 2023, at the regular press conference of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Liu Zhiquan, Director of the Environmental Impact Assessment and Emission Management Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, introduced that under the situation of severe penalties and severe penalties, the environmental impact assessment documents Quality continues to improve, and the environmental impact assessment market further stimulates vitality. However, there are still people who go against the trend and commit crimes, seriously disrupting market order and damaging the credibility of the environmental impact assessment system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May and September 2023, verdicts were announced respectively in the environmental assessment fraud case of Shandong Jinhua Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. and the environmental assessment fraud case of Jiangxi Zhanhang Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. The actual controller, legal representative, and &quot;Affiliated&quot; environmental impact assessment engineers and many others were sentenced. As typical cases, these two cases of environmental impact assessment fraud have aroused widespread concern in society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We must learn lessons deeply, use cases as lessons, draw inferences from one instance, and strengthen the implementation of responsibilities.” Liu Zhiquan said. While adhering to the &quot;strict&quot; tone, environmental impact assessment supervision will further improve daily supervision and long-term mechanism construction. Specific measures include continuing to strengthen daily supervision and carrying out quarterly early warnings for abnormal situations in the work of environmental impact assessment personnel. We will use intelligent review of environmental impact assessment documents to detect emerging problems in a timely manner, and jointly conduct regular inspections with the human resources and social security departments to strictly crack down on &quot;affiliation&quot; and other behaviors. We will revise the &quot;Supervision and Management Measures for the Preparation and Supervision of Environmental Impact Reports (Tables) for Construction Projects&quot; to comprehensively strengthen the quality of environmental impact assessment documents. Supervision, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;EIAs with quality problems&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;will be reported to the approval department and assessment agency&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Liu Zhiquan He said that environmental assessment units play a technical support role in the environmental assessment work of construction projects and bear direct responsibility for the content and conclusions of environmental assessment documents. They must operate in accordance with the law and operate with integrity in the industry, and rely on providing high-quality environmental assessment documents to win the market. “If someone is only interested in profit, Anyone who dares to test the law will be severely punished by the law.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Environmental impact assessment engineers play a vital role in the preparation of environmental impact assessment documents as the preparation host. Liu Zhiquan said that the environmental impact assessment engineer involved in the case &quot;affiliated&quot; his professional qualification as an environmental impact assessment engineer in order to make a small profit. He crossed the bottom line of professional ethics and the bottom line of the law, causing irreversible and serious impact on work, life and family. , “All environmental assessment engineers and all environmental assessment practitioners should take this warning and keep the bottom line of environmental assessment practice.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Environmental impact assessment laws and regulations clearly stipulate that the construction unit is responsible for the content and conclusions of the environmental impact assessment document, and should bear the main responsibility for the quality of the environmental impact assessment document of the construction project. Liu Zhiquan said that this is a warning that construction units must pay great attention to it, give priority to environmental impact assessment units with good credit and meet the requirements of capacity building guidelines, implement the main responsibilities, and review the content and conclusions of environmental impact assessment documents. Cause irreparable losses and even bear serious legal consequences.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Zhiquan also said that environmental assessment approval and assessment departments and experts must strictly implement their check-in responsibilities. If environmental impact assessment documents with quality problems are approved, the approval department, assessment agency and experts will be notified simultaneously. If there are serious quality problems, the approval will be revoked in accordance with the law and the responsibility will be strictly investigated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The number of environmental impact assessment approvals has surged, with new energy vehicle projects increasing by 179.5% year-on-year&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From January to August 2023, a total of 80,900 environmental impact assessment approvals were completed across the country. A year-on-year increase of 13%, involving a total investment of 14.7 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 9.4%. Among them, new energy-related industries are growing rapidly. There were 218 new energy vehicle projects, a year-on-year increase of 179.5%; there were 317 wind power projects, a year-on-year increase of 63.4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Zhiquan said that he will continue to implement the &quot;three ledgers&quot; of environmental assessment approval (list of environmental assessment approval services for major projects at the national, local, and foreign levels) and the green channel mechanism, and work with local governments to speed up review and approval, and provide the basis for major projects. Create conditions for the project to start as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as January 17, 2023, at the regular press conference of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Liu Zhiquan said that he would work with the development and reform, commerce, transportation, water conservancy and other departments to clarify the 2023 plan as soon as possible For the list of key projects such as railways, water conservancy, energy supply, and foreign investment, we will intervene in advance to guide the preparation of environmental assessments, strengthen ecological and environmental protection measures, open green channels to improve efficiency, and assist the implementation of major projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this press conference, Liu Zhiquan introduced that in 2023, the number of environmental impact assessment approvals for infrastructure, new energy, environmental governance and other projects across the country will grow rapidly. In the first half of the year, 1,642 environmental impact assessments of water conservancy projects were approved across the country, a year-on-year increase of 37%; 29 special railway line projects were approved, a record high number. In addition, environmental management industries such as air pollution control and solid waste disposal and utilization also maintain rapid growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of environmental impact assessment approval of major infrastructure projects, Liu Zhiquan said that the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has approved the environmental impact assessment of 20 major projects such as transportation, energy, water conservancy and hydropower, involving a total investment of more than 260 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the progress of environmental assessment approval of major infrastructure projects has been accelerated. On the other hand, the bottom line of ecological and environmental protection must also be firmly guarded. Liu Zhiquan introduced that in terms of transportation, 11 planning environmental assessments for ports, railways, subways, etc. have been reviewed in 2023, and 3 project environmental assessments have been approved. These projects have bypassed environmental protection goals such as national aquatic germplasm resource reserves and concentrated residential areas.

As women born in the 1980s and 1990s become a new generation of study mothers, they pay more attention to their self-worth and are no longer limited to the traditional &quot;full-time nanny&quot; status.

Currently, her son has successfully completed junior high school and high school and entered university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Ya said that some young international students will complain to their parents. For example, &quot;You don&#39;t understand&quot; and &quot;You haven&#39;t studied in the United States.&quot; However, this problem does not exist in her communication with her son, because she herself also &quot;study&quot; in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2021, Qiao Ya’s previous company dismissed a group of employees due to structural adjustments, and she was also on the disbanded list. Frustrated, Qiao Ya decided to go back to school to study for an MBA. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from college, studying for an MBA was Qiao Ya’s “unfulfilled dream.” The high-value MBA is also a &quot;shortcut&quot; to quickly integrate into the local area and enhance competitiveness in the workplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the application process, Qiao Ya retrieved her scores from China, commissioned an agency to translate them into English, found someone to write letters of recommendation, and took the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), etc. This is no small challenge for her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2021, Qiao Ya was successfully admitted to the University of California, Irvine. &quot;Although (the process) was extremely difficult,&quot; the result pleased her. &quot;I proved myself and realized my dream.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Ya will graduate from MBA in June 2024, while her son will graduate from college in June 2026. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We are both in sync.

At the same time, he also feels that his mother is very pursuing, which also plays a role for him. It serves as a role model,&quot; Qiao Ya said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Ya shared her dream-realization experience on social platforms, which attracted many likes in the circle of accompanying mothers. She believes that every woman has her own strengths. Whether you are good at cooking or gardening, you must realize your potential and see your own value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;40-year-old women are also an integral part of society.

On the one hand, her daughter can learn figure skating, music and dance here at very low cost, and she herself is also learning foreign languages, accumulating industry experience and preparing for a new job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This does not mean stability.

Currently, both children are international students, and the tuition fee is about 80,000 yuan per year. In Liangmei’s hometown of Shanghai, tuition fees for international schools have been priced at RMB 200,000-300,000 per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangmei said that she plans to apply for graduate school in Canada. &quot;If I can apply to school and get a study permit or work permit, my children can study in public schools here for free.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you choose to study in a developing country, the cost of accompanying you will further increase. compression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying was once a chicken mother in Dongcheng District, Beijing. Her eldest son&#39;s &quot;chicken baby&quot; experience left her physically and mentally exhausted, and she decided not to suffer the &quot;second crop crime&quot; again. In 2017, Liu Ying took her daughter to Johor Bahru, Malaysia, and enrolled in a local international school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying said that when she first arrived in Johor Bahru, her daughter’s annual tuition fee was about 6,000 yuan, which was lower than the monthly fee for her daughter’s public kindergarten in Beijing. Currently, my daughter is in seventh grade, and the tuition fee is about 30,000 yuan per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in international schools, the higher the grade, the more expensive the tuition is. If the daughter goes to grade 10-12 (equivalent to domestic high school), the cost may rise to RMB 130,000-150,000 per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying reminded that the cost of studying abroad varies from person to person, and developing countries are not synonymous with &quot;cheap&quot;. The order of tuition fees for studying in Malaysia is: private schools >; Chinese schools >; public schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, locals in Malaysia can study for free in government schools, while only those with good family conditions send their children to international schools. &quot;A friend just transferred his child to an American school. Even the school bus costs 1,800 yuan per month.&quot; Liu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from the &quot;private elite&quot; and &quot;direct access to Europe and the United States&quot; routes for middle-class families, there are also families who choose the &quot;niche&quot; education route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MJ4s2ihpFSYpKDPHowbLkLezeKSBQznqPk1TwPxn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MJ4s2ihpFSYpKDPHowbLkLezeKSBQznqPk1TwPxn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252248&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;July 16, 2023 is the Armenian Water Splashing Festival. Haili’s daughter Mu En (first from right) plays with local children. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haili said that the reason for choosing Armenia is that Armenia has low entry threshold. Foreigners do not need to purchase real estate, deposit funds, etc. to apply for a residence permit. On the other hand, compared with the same training programs in China, the education fees here are simply &quot;cabbage prices&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Haili has enrolled her 6-year-old daughter in a number of courses - including figure skating, violin, rhythmic gymnastics, etc. According to her, the monthly group class fees for these courses range from 200 to 400 yuan, and the courses include 8 to 12 classes. If you ask for one-on-one private tutoring, the cost is 100-200 yuan/session. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to the educational &quot;legacy&quot; left by the former Soviet Union, Armenia has rich educational resources and many cultural and sports projects are very strong. Take figure skating as an example. The ice rink where Haili&#39;s daughter learns figure skating attracts figure skaters for training every summer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trusova, who won the runner-up in single figure skating at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, has been here many times, and Haili’s daughter once took a photo with her. The group classes here only cost about 220 yuan per month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If we were in China, we might not even have enough ice rink tickets.&quot; Haili said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The most feared thing is&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;sickness and accidents&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;When the decision to study abroad is made, the division of labor among the families accompanying the students is mostly similar - the mother goes abroad to accompany the student while the father stays to earn money. In daily life, most fathers contact their wives and children through Internet phone calls. Only during holidays can the two places get together &quot;flyingly&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the mothers accompanying them, this division of labor is partly because women participate in more family childcare work and have more advantages in taking care of children. On the other hand, it is related to local immigration policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying said that in Malaysia, accompanying visas are only issued to female immediate family members. “So most of the people I see accompanying young international students here are mothers or grandmothers.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a foreign country, the lives of young international students depend entirely on the care of limited elders. Once they get sick or have an accident, the family operation basically stops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years in Malaysia, Liu Ying has met many Chinese mothers who have gone through the same experience, and has also heard many embarrassing stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On one occasion, a mother who was accompanying her to school suffered a burglary at home. &quot;The mother and son were sleeping, and suddenly a knife was placed on their necks.&quot; Although no one was harmed in the aftermath, it caused a considerable psychological shadow on the children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another time, a Chinese mother who was studying with her died suddenly in her apartment at night. The next day when the child was preparing to go to school with others, he was discovered by other Chinese mothers. Liu Ying said that because the father of the child could not enter the country for a while, the funeral arrangements for the deceased mother relied on the help of other Chinese accompanying mothers. After the father&#39;s emergency visa was issued, the child was safely brought back to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The biggest fear for mothers who study abroad is illness and accidents, and a string in their minds is extremely tight. Occasionally, when you return to China, you are more likely to get sick. That’s because the string finally has a chance to loosen. &quot;Liu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving for Canada, Shanghai mother Liangmei brought enough medicine. She said, &quot;I brought all kinds of medicines that I could foresee, such as cold medicines, antibiotics, etc.&quot; Even so, not long after arriving in Canada, Liangmei went to see a doctor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My waist flashed and I always felt uncomfortable. Later, accompanied by my friends, I decided to see a doctor.” Liangmei said that she went to a clinic at that time. &quot;The whole process can be communicated with the doctor in normal language, and it is not as complicated as I imagined.&quot; However, Liangmei is worried that if she encounters a &quot;big trouble&quot; like a child with a fever in the future, she will still feel uneasy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Families who have the conditions will also choose to have their parents study with them at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang Xinhe, a mother from Guangzhou, is engaged in the cosmetics industry in China. Because her child went to study abroad, they also went to Vancouver and Kuala Lumpur to accompany her. Zhang Xin believes that the company of parents is conducive to the growth of children. If only the mother accompanies the child to study, it will not only be detrimental to the growth of the child, but will also cause many family conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, no matter how thorough the accompanying plan is, the many differences between Chinese and Western education will still bring challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xin’s children previously studied in a public school in Vancouver, Canada, with annual tuition fees of about 90,000 yuan. But &quot;there is almost no hardware&quot;: in Zhang Xin&#39;s words, &quot;the school has no protective fences or security guards, and the door is open, making people feel insecure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The local concept of happy education also makes Zhang Xin anxious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the first few months when my child went to school, the teacher had been teaching the ABC letters. After the child came home, I asked her what she did all day, and she said that the teacher kept asking us to play. It rains often in winter in Canada. When it snows, children often have snowball fights on the playground,&quot; Zhang Xin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the influence of many factors, Zhang Xin decided to transfer her child to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to study in a private international school. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“The future is open”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Johor Bahru, Malaysia, Liu Ying’s daughter speaks three languages ​​on a daily basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I speak Chinese at home, English at school, and I need to speak a few words of Malay when I go shopping.” There are also many young international students from South Korea and Japan in local international schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to experience a better English-speaking environment in Toronto, Canada, Liangmei moved her children from the multi-ethnic city center to the suburbs where whites are relatively concentrated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the families interviewed, the young international students generally left China when they were in primary school or junior high school, and their ages ranged from 6 to 13 years old. Before their values ​​and worldview have yet to be formed, it is easier for them to master a new language and experience the collision of different cultures. However, in a &quot;multilingual growing up&quot; environment, you sometimes face unexpected &quot;conflicts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xin said that many young international students in Canada receive English education locally, but when they grow up, they cannot speak Chinese well, &quot;let alone write.&quot; Among the many reasons why Zhang Xin decided to transfer her children to another school, &quot;preventing them from forgetting their mother tongue&quot; was one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the young international students grow up, their future development paths are also put on the agenda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, some families accompanying students would pass the Overseas Chinese Student Joint Entrance Examination to allow their children to return to the mainstream domestic education system and obtain admission to key universities at a lower threshold. However, Liu Ying felt that this path was not easy to follow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We will basically not consider the joint entrance examination for overseas Chinese students, because the possibility of policy changes is quite high.” Liu Ying believes that the era of using studying abroad as a springboard and trying to overtake in corners has passed, and small students Parents of international students also do not let their children study. &quot;I have to pay such a high price to accompany them to study. I don&#39;t want to just get a diploma.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying’s daughter is currently in seventh grade in Malaysia, and she has an open mind about her daughter’s future. &quot;Currently, many Chinese in Malaysia and Singapore have immigrated to various parts of the world. They have a more open mind, a broader vision, and are willing to go further. In fact, this is worth learning from us.&quot; Liu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Ya hopes that after her son graduates from an American university, he will continue to apply for graduate studies at an American “Ivy League school”. As for the development after graduate school, it is up to my son to decide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Children’s roots are still in China, whether it is cultural roots, emotions, or social ties.” Qiao Ya believes that foreign humanistic environments play a great role in children’s growth (this points also apply to adults). But no matter where they are, children and adults need to gradually mature their minds and stabilize their foundations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Essentially, the world is the same, and there are beautiful places. It depends on how you shape your own life.&quot; Qiao Ya said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/1UXoq3AssTQKjlb96CDRWXJ2xzpTQBjYkZfPom8Y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1257&quot; height= &quot;942&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/1UXoq3AssTQKjlb96CDRWXJ2xzpTQBjYkZfPom8Y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shanghai mother Liangmei said that children&#39;s independence and hands-on ability have been improved by studying and living overseas. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangmei has just arrived in Toronto and has not yet made precise plans for the future of her children.

Big attention. On September 26, the Datong City Joint Investigation Team reported that it was confirmed that two 9-year-old male students &quot;repeatedly committed serious bad behaviors such as insults, beatings, and bullying&quot; against another male student in the same dormitory. The offender &quot;will be reprimanded in accordance with the law and ordered to receive psychological counseling and behavioral modification&quot;, and his or her guardian &quot;will be reprimanded and ordered to receive family education guidance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This official notification did not calm public opinion, but instead caused greater controversy, because the punishment for the two bullies was too light, and it was not even a punishment at all. The vague statement in the official report that &quot;repeatedly committed insults, beatings, bullying and other serious bad behaviors&quot; is actually so shocking that even adults can&#39;t imagine it. It is difficult to recount, but I can only say that in addition to long-term insults and beatings, it also included serious personal insults and sexual assaults. If these acts were committed by adults, they would undoubtedly constitute the crime of child molestation. Given the severity of the circumstances and the severity of the impact, they would likely be sentenced to the fullest possible sentence. If the victim is a girl, it is a crime of rape of a young girl, and the death penalty may not be an exaggeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference in punishment caused by the age difference between the perpetrators has been a matter of widespread public concern for a long time. Two little boys committed such serious crimes, but because they were only 9 years old, their punishment could only be &quot;admonishment, forced psychological counseling and behavioral modification.&quot; How can such a painless treatment comfort the victims? This is unacceptable to the public. However, according to a well-known police influencer, &quot;At this age, it really can only be like this.&quot; Is the law really powerless against young devils? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the purpose of &quot;protecting minors&quot;, China&#39;s criminal law does stipulate that minors under a certain age who commit crimes will not be held criminally responsible. Before the 11th Amendment to the Criminal Law comes into effect, minors who are over 14 years old and under 16 years old are only required to bear criminal responsibility when they commit eight serious crimes. Those under 14 years old are not criminally responsible for any crime they commit. . Even though the Criminal Law Amendment (11) stipulates that those who are over 12 years old but under 14 years old can be held criminally responsible for intentional homicide or intentional injury if the circumstances are serious and the impact is serious, but those under 12 years old are still absolutely exempt from criminal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the previous criminal law also stipulated that those who are not subject to criminal punishment due to age can, in addition to ordering their guardians to discipline them, also be &quot;cused and educated by the government&quot; when necessary. In 2019, after the C&amp;E system was abolished, the new criminal law changed this to &quot;specialized correctional education in accordance with the law.&quot; The new law on the prevention of juvenile delinquency makes specific provisions on this type of specialized correctional education: If a minor commits an act stipulated in the criminal law and is not subject to criminal punishment because he is under the legal age of criminal responsibility, the education administration shall, upon evaluation and approval by the Specialized Education Steering Committee, The department, together with the public security organ, may decide to provide special correctional education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;specialized correctional education&quot; here is compulsory. It only requires the evaluation and approval of the Specialized Education Steering Committee and is decided by the education administration department in conjunction with the public security agency. It does not require the consent of the guardian. The objects of this type of specialized correctional education, even in specialized schools, must receive education in &quot;specialized places.&quot; This specialized place must &quot;implement closed-loop management. The public security organs and judicial administrative departments are responsible for the correction of minors. The education administrative department shall be responsible for the education of minors.” There is no age limit for the subjects of this kind of specialized correctional education, and there is no &quot;no less than 12 years old&quot; rule mentioned by the aforementioned big V. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, there are no legal provisions for the treatment of young serious offenders. Although being sent to a specialized school for correctional education is not a criminal punishment, it is at least much stronger than indifferent treatments such as &quot;reprimands and orders to undergo behavior modification.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in reality, these legal provisions are rarely applied. The first reason is that there are few specialized schools, and the second reason is that most places have not yet established corresponding departments and procedures. According to research data from the Ninth Procuratorate of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, which is responsible for the prosecution of minors, as early as 2019, the central government proposed that &quot;local governments at or above the county level should reasonably set up specialized schools according to needs.&quot; However, as of May 2022, there are only There are more than 110 schools, and 9 provinces have no specialized schools, and many provinces and even the most populous provinces only have one specialized school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are many minors who need to receive such &quot;specialized correctional education&quot;. According to data from the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, in 2021, procuratorial organs in various regions, in collaboration with relevant departments, sent 2,159 minors who had committed crimes to vocational schools for correctional education. Hainan Daily also reported a few days ago that 4 specialized schools have been built in Hainan province, and have admitted 276 students in the first eight months of 2023 (the report did not specify how many of these students were forced to receive specialized correctional education in accordance with the law). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient places and institutions leave many delinquent minors who should be forced to receive &quot;specialized correctional education&quot; with nowhere to send them. They can only be &quot;reprimanded&quot; and let go. This may allow some minors to regard the Minors Protection Law as a talisman and engage in illegal and criminal activities without restraint: they will not be severely punished anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to providing powerful &quot;special corrective education&quot; for minors who have committed crimes, their guardians should also pay a greater price for poor education. For example, the amount of “mental damage compensation” in current Chinese legal practice is too low and has been criticized. Judicial practice should greatly increase the upper limit of the amount of mental damage compensation. On the one hand, this can better compensate the victims, and on the other hand, it can also improve the deterrence of illegal crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the protection of minors is not the protection of minors from crime. Only by severely punishing and dealing with minors who break the law and commit crimes can we better reduce minors&#39; violations and crimes and protect more minors. The compulsory specialized correctional education system should be implemented as soon as possible and implemented effectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为了避世、高考、不流浪……：在鹤岗买房的人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257724]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[走向抽象化的数学]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257669]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/jQiplTYJng0JKlmMwDq1HulW9MYmPLvLsk4KRtjJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/jQiplTYJng0JKlmMwDq1HulW9MYmPLvLsk4KR tjJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252166&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: left;&quot;>;The real counterpart to &quot;abstract algebra&quot; should be &quot;abstract art&quot;, which specifically refers to Those paintings without any identifiable subject, the Russian painter Kandinsky is considered the first &quot;abstract painter&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Set Theory and Axiomatization&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;The changes in geometry and algebra in the 19th century brought rapid development and unprecedented prosperity to mathematics in the 20th century. Modern mathematics is no longer just a few traditional subjects such as geometry, algebra, and analysis. It has become a knowledge system with many branches and a complex structure, and it is still developing and changing. The characteristics of mathematics are not only strict logic, but also add two other characteristics, namely high degree of abstraction and wide application, and thus form two major scopes of modern mathematics research, namely pure mathematics and applied mathematics. Some of the latter developed the computer, which, apart from its importance, has provided more employment to mankind than all other branches of mathematics put together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pure mathematics was initially driven by two factors, namely the penetration of set theory and the application of axiomatic methods. Set theory was originally founded by Cantor in the late 19th century. It was opposed by many great mathematicians, including Kronecker. It was later recognized because of its increasingly obvious role in mathematics. Sets were initially built on number sets or point sets, and soon the scope of the definition was expanded to include any set of elements, such as a set of functions, a set of geometric figures, etc. This allows set theory to enter different fields of mathematics as a universal language, causing profound changes in basic concepts such as integrals, functions, and spaces in mathematics. It also stimulates the changes between intuitionism and formalism in mathematical logic that will be discussed in this article. Further development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cantor was a Dane born in St. Petersburg. His Jewish parents did business in Russia when they were young, and their business expanded to Hamburg, London and even New York. Like Kelly, he can be said to be a role model for the children of businessmen outside the country, but Cantor&#39;s grandparents came to St. Petersburg. At the age of 11, Cantor moved to Germany with his parents, where he spent most of his life. He went to high school in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and later went to Zurich, Switzerland, and several universities in Germany. He gradually fell in love with mathematics and decided to make it his career, although his talent in painting once made his family proud. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cantor&#39;s eyes, a set is a totality of objects, whether they are finite or infinite. When using one-to-one correspondence to study sets, he came to a surprising result: rational numbers are countable, that is, they can correspond to natural numbers one-to-one. At the same time, he proved that all real numbers are uncountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, Cantor also gave a non-constructive proof of the existence of transcendental numbers. In fact, Cantor proved that algebraic numbers are countable just like rational numbers, and that real numbers are uncountable. In this way, since all algebraic numbers and transcendental numbers constitute the real numbers, transcendental numbers not only exist but are much more numerous than algebraic numbers. The study of transcendental numbers later became a landscape of number theory research in the 20th century. However, when Cantor determined that infinity was a real existence, he was opposed and attacked by his colleagues for a long time, especially Kronecker (1823-1891), a Jewish professor at the University of Berlin. The latter was not only an outstanding mathematician but also a successful mathematician. businessman and the most powerful fighter in scientific debates, while Cantor was so weak and incompetent that he spent his entire life as a professor at a third-rate university, although the truth was on his side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cantor introduced the theory of cardinal numbers to set theory, calling the cardinal number of all integers Alev zero, and calling the subsequent larger cardinal numbers Alev one, Alev two, and so on ( Aleph is a Hebrew letter and Cantor is also Jewish). That is, he classified the infinite. He also proved that the cardinality of the entire set of real numbers is greater than Alev zero. This leads to the so-called Cantor continuum hypothesis: there is no other cardinality between Aleph zero and the cardinality of all real numbers. At the beginning of the 20th century, when the German mathematician Hilbert delivered his famous &quot;Mathematical Problems&quot; speech at the World Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, he listed this hypothesis or conjecture at the forefront of the 23 mathematical problems left for the 20th century (Transcendental Number Problem is listed at No. 7). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Cantor discovered that the &quot;mathematical body&quot; was seriously ill and that the disease transmitted to it by Zeno in ancient Greece had not been relieved, he couldn&#39;t help but want to cure it. However, his Promethean attack on the infinite problem caused his own nervous breakdown when he was only 40 years old. He died much later in a mental hospital in central Germany. The year after Hilbert gave his speech, Russell also expressed his views:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zeno cared about Three problems: infinitesimal, infinite and continuous. The best minds of every generation have tried to solve these problems, but literally, they have gotten nowhere. ...Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor solved them thoroughly. Their answers were so clear that they no longer left any doubt. This achievement may be the greatest that this era can boast. ...The problem of infinitesimals was solved by Weierstrass, the solution of the other two problems was started by Dedekind and finally completed by Cantor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The axiomatic method was summarized by Euclid as early as the ancient Greek era and adopted in his famous work &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot;. As we all know, this book uses 5 postulates and 5 axioms. However, the axiom system proposed by Euclid is not perfect. The German mathematician Hilbert redefined the modern axiomatic method. He pointed out, &quot;Whether these objects are points, lines, surfaces, tables, chairs, or beer glasses, they can all become such geometric objects. For them, , the relationships expressed by the axioms are all true.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take points, lines, and surfaces as examples. Euclid gave these objects descriptive definitions, but in Hilbert&#39;s eyes they are all These are purely abstract objects with no specific concrete content. In addition, Hilbert also examined the interrelationships between the axioms and clearly put forward the basic logical requirements for the axiom system, namely compatibility, independence and completeness. Of course, axiomatization is just a method and is not as rich in content as set theory. Nevertheless, Hilbert&#39;s axiomatic method not only gave geometry a strict logical foundation, but also gradually penetrated into other fields of mathematics, becoming a powerful tool for synthesizing and refining mathematical knowledge and promoting specific mathematical research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hilbert was born in 1861 on the outskirts of Königsberg in East Prussia, which now belongs to the divided Russian territory, surrounded by Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea, and has long been renamed Kaliningrad. Although the greatest citizen born in that city was the philosopher Immanuel Kant (who spent his entire life in this remote city), he had an indissoluble bond with mathematics. It turns out that the Pregel River flowing through the city is divided into two branches. There are seven bridges on the river, five of which connect the river bank to a small island in the river. So a mathematical problem arises. Suppose that a person can only cross each bridge. Can you cross all seven bridges once? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seemingly simple problem later became the starting point of topology and was solved by the Swiss mathematician Euler. However, it was a boy from the same city who was two years younger than him, Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909), who directly guided Hilbert firmly on the path of mathematics. Hermann was born in Kaunas, Russia (now Lithuania), and moved to Königsberg with his family when he was 8 years old, just across the river from Hilbert&#39;s family. This talented Jewish boy won the Mathematics Prize of the Paris Academy of Sciences just after he turned 18. His 6-year-old brother Oscar is the &quot;father of insulin&quot; and discovered the connection between insulin and diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Associating with such a peerless talent, Hilbert&#39;s talent was not only not buried, but was honed and hoarded, prompting him to work quietly and lay a more solid foundation. The friendship between the two men (who later became brothers) lasted for a quarter of a century, stretching from Königsberg to Göttingen. Minkowski later died young of acute appendicitis, while Hilbert lived to Over eighty years old, he has accomplished the great achievements of a generation of masters. In 1900, Hilbert raised 23 mathematical problems at the World Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, which pointed the direction for the development of mathematics in the 20th century. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Abstraction of mathematics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The viewpoint of set theory and the axiomatic method gradually became the paradigm of mathematical abstraction in the 20th century. After they are combined with each other, they become more It has the power to lead the development of mathematics to a more abstract path, leading to the rise of the four major branches of abstract mathematics: real variable function theory, functional analysis, topology and abstract algebra in the first half of the 20th century. They can be called the four abstract branches. The flower of mathematics. Interestingly, the five mathematicians mentioned in the previous section (including Kronecker) are all Germans. They may be one of the nations best at abstract thinking. Mathematics is of course the most abstract branch of science, and Germany is also home to a large number of talents whether in the most abstract art - music, or in the most abstract humanities and social sciences - philosophy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The viewpoint of set theory first caused the reform of integral calculus, which led to the establishment of the theory of real variable functions. At the end of the 19th century, the rigor of analysis forced many mathematicians to seriously consider so-called &quot;ill-conditioned functions&quot;, such as the everywhere continuous but everywhere non-differentiable function defined by Weierstrass, and the everywhere defined by Gauss&#39;s student Dirichlet. Discontinuous function. On this basis, mathematicians have studied how to extend the concept of integrals to a wider class of functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first person to succeed in this regard was the French mathematician Lebesgue (1875-1941). He used set theory methods to define the concept of measure (Lebesgue measure) as the successor to the original concept of &quot;length&quot;. Generalization, the so-called Lebesgue integral was established, thus generalizing the concept of definite integral. On this basis, the reciprocity of differential operations and integral operations was used to reconstruct the basic theorem of calculus of Newton and Leibniz, thus forming a new branch of mathematics - the theory of real variable functions. Likewise, this new thing was rebuked by some mathematical authorities, and Lebesgue himself was unable to find a job for almost 10 years after publishing the results. Today, people refer to Lebesgue&#39;s previous analysis as classical analysis, and his subsequent analysis as modern analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to real variable function theory, another important component of modern analysis is functional analysis. The so-called &quot;functional&quot; can be regarded as &quot;a function of functions&quot;. This term was introduced by the French mathematician Hadamard (1865-1963, famous for being the first to prove the prime number theorem in number theory). Many mathematicians have made important contributions in the theory of functional analysis. Among them, Hilbert introduced a set of infinite real numbers. After defining concepts and operations such as &quot;inner product&quot;, he established the first infinite-dimensional space. , the so-called Hilbert space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the viewpoint of set theory helped to establish real variable function theory and functional analysis, axiomatic methods were also penetrating into the field of mathematics. The most representative result was the formation of abstract algebra. Since Galois proposed the concept of groups, it has developed from finite groups and discrete groups to infinite groups and continuous groups. Algebraic objects are also expanding, and other algebraic systems are further produced, such as rings, fields, lattice, ideals, etc. Since then, the center of algebraic research has shifted to algebraic structures. This structure consists of a number of binary composite operations between the elements of the set. It has the following characteristics: first, the elements of the set must be abstract; second, the operations are performed through stipulated by axioms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is generally believed that the &quot;Ideal Theory in Rings&quot; published by the German mathematician Noether (1882-1935) in 1921 is the beginning of abstract algebra. She is one of the most innovative mathematicians in this field. , and her disciples are all over the world. Noether is considered to be the greatest female mathematician to date, that is to say, surpassing the four famous female mathematicians before her, namely Hypatia of ancient Greece and Agnesi (1718-1799) of modern Italy. ), Germain of France (1776-1831) and Kovalevskaya of Russia. Despite this, due to gender discrimination, Noether was not able to be a lecturer at the University of Göttingen for a long time. Until the Nazi government came to power, she was not a professor at over fifty years old. After arriving in the United States, she was only a professor at a women&#39;s college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, we want to talk about topology. The German-American mathematician Weyl (1885-1955) said that the topological angel and the algebraic devil launched a magnificent fight to occupy every piece of mathematical territory. This shows the importance of these two subjects. In comparison, topology has earlier origins and more interesting examples than abstract algebra, such as the Seven Bridges Problem of Königsberg (1736) and the Four-Color Problem of the Map (1852). , and the Möbius Strip (1858). Topology studies the continuous properties of geometric figures, that is, properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformation (stretching, twisting but not cutting and bonding). The word topology was introduced by a student of Gauss (1847), whose Greek The original meaning of the text is &quot;the knowledge of position&quot;. Although it originally belonged to geometry, its two major branches are algebraic topology and point set topology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Point set topology is also called general topology. It regards geometric figures as a collection of points and the entire set as a space. Mathematicians started from the concept of &quot;neighborhood&quot; and introduced a series of concepts such as continuity, connectivity, and dimensionality, plus properties such as compactness, separability, and connectivity to establish this discipline. It also has some interesting examples. For example, at the North Pole of the earth, every direction faces south, which is a defect of longitude and latitude; there is always at least one place without wind (the center of the typhoon) at any time on the earth. These two completely different facts correspond to the fixed point theorem in topology: the continuous transformation of an n-dimensional simplex to itself has at least one fixed point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The founder of algebraic topology was the French mathematician Poincaré. Just like a wall made of bricks, he divided geometric figures into a finite number of interconnected small figures. He defined the so-called high-dimensional manifolds, homeomorphisms and homology. Later mathematicians developed the theory of homology and homotopy, and transformed topological problems into abstract algebra problems. One of the earliest famous theorems in this field was proposed by Descartes (1635) and discovered by Euler (1752), that is, the number of vertices plus the number of faces minus the number of edges of any polyhedron without holes is equal to 2. There is also the so-called Poincaré Conjecture (1904), which states that any three-dimensional simply connected closed manifold must be homeomorphic to a three-dimensional sphere. A $1 million reward was offered for proof of this conjecture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four-dimensional space is a special form of non-Euclidean geometry. When people are still debating non-Euclidean geometry and the philosophical consequences of violating Euclid’s fifth postulate, Poincaré taught us to imagine this. In the four-dimensional world, &quot;the images of external objects are depicted on the retina, and this retina is a two-dimensional painting; these images are a perspective view...&quot; According to his explanation, since a scene from the two-dimensional surface is viewed from the three-dimensional surface As a projection from the three-dimensional plane, an image on the three-dimensional surface can also be regarded as a projection from the four-dimensional plane. Poincaré suggested that the fourth dimension could be described as the succession of different perspectives on the canvas. According to the visual talent of the Spanish painter Picasso, he believed that these different perspectives should be displayed in time simultaneity, so there was &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon&quot; (1907) - the pioneering work of Cubism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that among the many readers of &quot;Science and Hypothesis&quot; (1902), there was a Paris actuary named Plance. On the eve of the birth of Cubism, he was the lover of the Spanish painter Picasso. Member of the &quot;Laundry Boat&quot; artist circle. It was under his introduction that new geometry became a new artistic language &quot;explored with passion&quot;. Apollinaire, Picasso&#39;s friend and Cubist interpreter, concluded, &quot;The fourth dimension is not a mathematical concept, but a metaphor, which contains the seeds of new art.&quot; In the poet&#39;s view, &quot;Cubism uses an infinite The universe has replaced a finite universe centered on humans.&quot; He also pointed out that &quot;geometric figures are essential to painting, and geometry is as important to plastic arts as grammar is to writing.&quot; Perhaps we can think that Cubism is a literary and art Since the Renaissance, painting and geometry have had another wonderful encounter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Abstract in Painting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The word &quot;abstract&quot; as a noun in Spanish means abstract, and it is often placed in an article. Begin your mathematics paper, below the title, author&#39;s name, and affiliation. In the field of art, it can be understood as something extracted from nature. Just as the emergence of abstract mathematics such as set theory once caused some controversy, the word has long been used in art with a somewhat derogatory connotation. It is also a matter of endless debate. Since Aristotle, painting and sculpture have been treated as imitative arts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the mid-19th century that artists began to lean toward a new artistic concept, that is, painting was an entity of its own existence, not an imitation of something else. Later, a kind of art gradually emerged, in which the theme became an accessory or something bent and deformed in order to emphasize the shape or means of expression. It was an art that did not aim at expressing nature. Cézanne can be said to be the pioneer of this art. He discovered that the eye views a scene continuously and simultaneously. His concepts of nature, people and painting are all displayed in the mountains, still lifes and portraits of his hometown of Provence. For Cézanne, abstraction was primarily a method aimed at recreating natural scenes in independent paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cézanne (1839-1906) is known as the &quot;Father of Abstract Art&quot; or &quot;The Father of Modern Art&quot;. Under his guidance, artists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries set off waves of modernism, typically Fauvism represented by the French painter Matisse (1869-1954) and Spanish painter Picasso. of Cubism. However, there are still some recognizable themes in the works of these painters, so they can only be called &quot;abstract&quot; or &quot;semi-abstract&quot; art. Here, abstract is just a general adjective, not a proper noun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real counterpart to the mathematical term &quot;abstract algebra&quot; should be &quot;abstract art&quot;, which refers specifically to paintings without any identifiable subject. The Russian painter Kandinsky is considered the first &quot;abstract painter&quot;. Since the 18th century, Russia, under Peter the Great and Empress Catherine, has long employed great scientists such as the Bernoulli brothers and Euler. At the same time, it has also begun a tradition of sponsoring the arts and has continued to have close ties with the West. In order to make contact, Russians often traveled to places such as France, Italy and Germany. Since the 19th century, Russian literature and music have reached a very high level, and drama and ballet have also made great progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1866, the year Riemann died, Kandinsky was born in Moscow. A few months later, Baudelaire also died in Paris. Kandinsky’s father’s lineage was a tea merchant from Siberia, and he was of Mongolian aristocratic descent. It is said that his grandmother was a Chinese Mongolian princess, and his mother was an authentic Muscovite. When Kandinsky was a child, he traveled to Italy with his parents and aunt, and soon moved to Odessa (now part of Ukraine) on the coast of the Black Sea. After his parents divorced, he lived with his aunt, attended high school in Odessa, and became a piano and cello player and an amateur painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 20, Kandinsky entered Moscow University to study law and economics until he obtained a doctorate. During this period, he still maintained great interest in painting, and once went to the northern Vologda state to work on it. While investigating racial history related to law, I became strongly interested in the colorful non-realistic style of local folk paintings. In 1896, the 30-year-old Kandinsky determined to become a painter. He resolutely gave up his position as an assistant professor at Moscow University and went to southern Germany to study at an art academy in Munich. He graduated after four years. Among his classmates were 13 years younger than him. The 20-year-old Swiss Klee (1879-1940) later joined hands to become the master of painting in the 20th century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was while in Munich that Kandinsky&#39;s style of painting of non-objective objects or without actual subjects began to take shape. After some exploration, he found and established his artistic goal: to express a spiritual reaction or decision through lines and colors, space and movement, without reference to visible natural objects. His early education in law also helped him become the most theoretical among painters. In the book &quot;On the Spirit of Art&quot;, he talked about the first time he noticed the artistic conception in the works of the French Impressionist painter Manet (1832-1883). The question of the dematerialization of objects continues to fascinate him. Revolutionary advances in natural science also shattered his belief in a tactile and perceptible physical world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Kandinsky, we can feel an inner power of mysticism, which is a spiritual product rather than a product of external scenes or manual skills. He himself wrote, &quot;Strictly speaking, the harmony of color and form must be based solely on the principle that touches the human soul.&quot; There is also such a description in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; published in his middle age: &lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The colors that left a deep impression on me at first were bright emerald green, white, magenta, black, and brown and yellow. These memories date back to when I was three years old. I have observed them on various objects, and now the shapes of those objects are far less clear in my eyes than the colors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As he grew older, Kandinsky began to evolve toward geometric abstraction, with circles and triangles as the main forms. This can also be seen from the names of his works, such as &quot;In Black&quot; &quot;In a Circle&quot; &quot;One Center&quot; &quot;Yellow Red Blue&quot; &quot;Three Voices&quot;. In his theoretical work &quot;From Points and Lines to Surfaces&quot; published in his later years, he even analyzed the imaginative effect of abstract factors in pictures, believing that horizontal lines represent coldness and vertical lines represent heat. Kandinsky is such a painter. He may not have a particularly memorable masterpiece, but any of his works has distinctive images and bright colors that will make you recognize it immediately and bring you pleasure or deep thought. This seems to indicate that abstract art (like non-Euclidean geometry) has a broader space for expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Kandinsky, the representative painters of abstract art include at least his compatriot Malevich (1878-1935), the Dutch Mondrian (1872-1944) and the American Pollock (1912) -1956). Malevich brought abstraction to a final geometric simplification, for example, by drawing a diagonal black-edged square on a white square. But Malevich and Kandinsky represent two directions of abstract art. He and his contemporary Mondrian were directly inspired by Cubism; while Pollock adopted the unconscious action technology of Surrealism to create With the technique of dripping and pouring paint on canvases and even car hoods, he and de Kooning (1904-1997), who smuggled themselves to the United States from the Netherlands, were the first New World artists to become world-famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[年轻人也会得老年病，关注阿尔茨海默症]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257699]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[外婆索要带孩费：“家务劳动补偿”的自然延伸？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257707]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Grandma sued her daughter and son-in-law for taking care of her children, demanding payment of remuneration from February 2018 to July 2023 192,000 yuan. Recently, the Guang&#39;an District Court of Guang&#39;an City, Sichuan Province ordered the daughter and son-in-law to pay 82,500 yuan to the grandmother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the court, because the child Xiaobao’s mother Hu and father Zhu had been working in Chengdu and were busy with work and had no time to take care of the child, they left Xiaobao in the care of his grandmother Duan. Hu said: She and her husband give her mother 1,000 yuan a month for living expenses and 2,000 yuan for child care. Hu said that he and Duan had signed an agreement on Xiaobao&#39;s custody, but the child&#39;s father did not know about it. When my grandmother tried repeatedly to get her, but to no avail, she filed a lawsuit in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court held that Hu and his wife had the rights and obligations to raise, educate, and protect Xiaobao, and were able to earn income through labor and had the ability to support the child. Duan had no legal obligation to support the child, so Hu The couple should pay the grandmother the necessary expenses incurred for daily care and nursing of the baby. However, the child&#39;s father, Zhu, said: The fundamental reason why the old man asked for &quot;child care fees&quot; was that he and the child&#39;s mother had a divorce dispute. &quot;The person she really wants to sue is me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a couple divorces, it is not difficult to understand why the elderly come up with unique strategies to obtain more benefits for their children. Of course, there is no problem with the court&#39;s decision. The current Marriage and Family Section of the Civil Code stipulates that both husband and wife jointly bear the obligation to raise, educate and protect minor children (Article 1058); Children and grandchildren have the obligation to support them (Article 1074), which is essentially consistent with the previously applicable marriage law provisions (Articles 21 and 28). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, statutory law and judicial practice now recognize small families, and large families only exist in the sense of customary law. Under normal circumstances, in the sense of statutory law, the elderly have neither any rights nor any responsibilities and obligations towards their small family members. Therefore, for the elderly of either party to help take care of the children is a matter of affection, not a duty. The elderly can choose to take them or not; they can take them voluntarily for free, or they can ask for compensation before or after the event. These are the rights of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time a similar verdict has been issued. There is a famous case in Nanjing. In 2010, Su married her husband Li. In August 2014, her son was born and was taken care of by her grandmother Fang. In August 2019, the two divorced. In December 2020, the court ruled that the divorce was granted, and the child was raised by Su. On October 10, 2020, Fang sued his daughter and son-in-law, who had not yet divorced at the time, demanding more than 200,000 yuan in childcare fees. The court held that Fang had no obligation to take care of the child and ordered Li to pay a total of more than 160,000 yuan in childcare fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judges have discretion and may make contrary decisions. There is a case in Tai&#39;an, Shandong. Yao married her husband Su in 2013 and had a daughter. The two divorced in 2021. During the marriage, both husband and wife worked, and Grandma Li took care of the children. In 2021, Li sued and demanded that Yao pay 100,000 yuan. The Ningyang County Court held that although the two parties are now divorced, the children still have a close relationship with their parents and ancestors, and the children should not be blamed for their elders&#39; entanglements. &quot;The children should be cared for and will not be supported,&quot; the court said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the elderly&#39;s request for childcare fees is also a natural extension of &quot;housework compensation&quot; and deserves attention and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In judicial practice, the concept of “housework compensation” often appears in divorce cases. One party works to earn money, creates wealth for the family, and provides transfer payments to those who stay at home full-time and their children; the other party stays at home full-time. According to the community property system, one person will receive half of the property upon divorce. For example, if the property is 2 million, each person will share 1 million. However, according to the idea of ​​&quot;family labor compensation&quot;, full-time earners need to provide some additional money to those who work full-time at home. The logic behind this division is that full-time stay-at-home workers contribute more to the family than full-time earners. Theoretically, because common property itself already means compensation for those who stay at home full-time, the so-called &quot;housework compensation&quot; is actually secondary compensation. Reasonable or not? There was endless debate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In actual divorce cases, one spouse who used to be a good couple can ask for additional &quot;housework compensation&quot; from the other spouse on the grounds that they stay at home full time. Then it would be more reasonable for one or both elderly people to ask for &quot;child care fees&quot; from the small family, because taking care of children is not the responsibility of the elderly in the first place. This is why when there are more and more divorce cases involving &quot;housework compensation&quot;, there are also more and more cases of the elderly asking for &quot;childcare fees&quot;. The two have both a positive correlation and a causal relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, even if it was just a matter of affection, not a duty, to take care of grandchildren in the legal sense, there were very few cases where one or both elderly people asked for &quot;child care fees&quot; from a small family. There were many reasons: or because they were The constraints of traditional extended family concepts and customary laws may be due to fear of hurting the relationship with grandchildren, or &quot;fear of being laughed at by others.&quot; But when a couple is divorcing, one party can ask for &quot;compensation for housework&quot; from the other party, and the constraints on these concepts of the elderly are invisibly relaxed and even disappear; one of the husband and wife may even secretly ask their parents for help, so that they can When an old man sues himself and his spouse, he will argue as much as possible, and &quot;the flesh rots in his own pot.&quot; This is why we are seeing more and more cases and reports like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贷中贷，“瑕疵案”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257726]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/26/VZjva2GziqcXupA02j2W8YDlQPOVfdpTWWeaVi6i.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;982&quot; height=&quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/VZjva2GziqcXupA02j2W8YDlQPOVfdp TWWeaVi6i. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252272&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2023, today’s Mujiangwang Village, Baqiao District, Xi’an City . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhai Xingli/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past nine years, Shaanxi businessman Hu Xufeng has been involved in 273 lawsuits. The origin of the 273 lawsuits is the urban village reconstruction project of Mujiangwang Village in Baqiao District, Xi&#39;an City that he began to develop in the 2000s. He was only 27 years old when he won this project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Huashang Daily&quot; report, on July 5, 2009, the Xi&#39;an Urban Reform Office released for the first time a list of 83 projects that had obtained the &quot;Approval of the Urban Village Renovation Plan&quot;. In terms of area, the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project covers an area of ​​785 acres, making it the largest one on the list. Based on the average sales price of commercial real estate surrounding the project, Hu Xufeng estimated that the market value of the project around 2016 was about 4 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the project development process, Hu Xufeng pledged the company&#39;s shares due to two private loans, and therefore lost control of the company. One of them was a cumulative loan of 6 million yuan from Wang Jian, a Zhejiang businessman who has lived in Xi&#39;an. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to regain his equity, Hu Xufeng launched a lengthy lawsuit against creditors and administrative agencies, and the lawsuit went all the way to the Supreme People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the Supreme People’s Court made a judgment on the civil case involving Hu Xufeng’s party suing Wang Jian, upholding the judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court, but found that the “Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement” on January 10, 2012 was illegal. The true expression of intention of the parties does not have the effect of equity transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng sued the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau based on this, petitioning to revoke Wang Jian&#39;s share change registration, but lost both cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng lodged a protest with the procuratorial organ. In July 2020, a prosecutor from the Seventh Procuratorate Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People&#39;s Procuratorate appeared in court to protest. After the protest, Hu Xufeng still lost the case in the retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Hu Xufeng’s opponent, the current shareholder of Hongrun Real Estate, applied to the Xi’an Market Supervision Bureau to change the legal representative, but was also rejected. On August 18, 2023, the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Intermediate Court made a second-instance judgment. The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau lost the case. The court ordered it to administratively handle Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s change application within 60 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that in this equity war that has lasted for nine years, the administrative agencies involved must make the final decision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of press time, the Xi’an Market Supervision Bureau had not responded to an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two private loans&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;International Happy City is located in the southeast of Xi&#39;an&#39;s central city, about 20 minutes&#39; drive from the city center, and close to the East Third Ring Road . Property staff said that at the end of 2022, with the opening of the subway Mujiangwang Station next to the community, the rent in the community will also increase slightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This real estate project with good market conditions is the origin of a series of lawsuits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng was born in Taibai Village, Shuigou Township, Shangnan County, Shangluo City, Shaanxi Province in 1980. After dropping out of junior high school, he went out to work. He claimed that he received advice from businessmen while working in other provinces, and returned to Xi&#39;an to do computer wholesale business and made his first pot of gold. Later, he was introduced to Xi&#39;an and started contracting projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, Hu Xufeng established Shaanxi Hongrun Industrial Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Hongrun Group&quot;) in Xi&#39;an. In May 2006, Shaanxi Hongrun Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Hongrun Real Estate&quot;) was registered and established. Hu Xufeng, who is only 26 years old, has the ability to buy a first-floor office building as the company&#39;s office space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, the Xi&#39;an Municipal People&#39;s Government issued the &quot;Opinions on Accelerating the Transformation of Urban Villages&quot; (Municipal Administration [2005] No. 92), proposing to &quot;encourage social capital investment to participate in urban village transformation projects to make up for the government&#39;s Fund shortage situation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave of urban village (shanty town) renovation, Hu Xufeng was introduced by someone and signed a joint development contract with the Mujiangwang Village Committee of Baqiao District in March 2007. After that, Hu Xufeng injected capital to start the project. While demolishing and demolishing, he built relocation housing and built commercial housing for sale to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hu Xufeng’s statistics, from the start of the project to the borrowing from Wang Jian in 2012, it invested a total of 820 million yuan in the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project, with the funds coming from self-raised and private loans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports of the year, the renovation of Mujiangwang Village was the largest project among the first batch of urban village renovations in Xi&#39;an. As for why it borrowed money from the private sector, &quot;the main reason was that the city&#39;s urban reform at that time was characterized by incomplete materials and insufficient procedures.&quot; Hu Xufeng&#39;s explanation was that the project land was developed first without the government purchasing and storing it, and the developer did not obtain the land use rights. Unable to get a bank mortgage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng named the commercial housing he built International Happy City, and the first batch of about 100 units were sold out within three days. During the development process, in 2010, Hu Xufeng’s friend Zhu Yaojiang proposed to take a stake. Judgment No. 1377 of Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu shows that Zhu Yaojiang was born in Shengzhou City, Zhejiang Province in 1966. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng said that in his early business activities, Zhu Yaojiang provided help. When buying shares, Zhu Yaojiang introduced him to the actual investor Li Bin and introduced Li Bin’s identity as a social worker in Shaanxi Province. President of the Charity Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 14, 2010, Zhu Yaojiang lent 80 million yuan to Hongrun Real Estate in the name of Xi&#39;an Zhongsha Investment Co., Ltd., and Hu Xufeng transferred 18% of Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s shares to Zhongsha Company for free, agreeing that The shares will be returned free of charge after Zhongxia Company obtains 18% of the project income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng said that when he borrowed money from outside the country before, no creditors asked him to mortgage his equity. &quot;Most of them were mortgages for houses that we have not yet opened.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 11, 2012, Zhu Yaojiang introduced Wang Jian to lend 6 million yuan to Hongrun Real Estate. The loan materials obtained by Southern Weekend reporters show that Wang Jian was born in 1968 in Taizhou, Zhejiang. The term of this loan is 3 months. Hu Xufeng will transfer 75% of the shares of Hongrun Real Estate to Wang Jian for free. After Hu Xufeng repays the loan, Wang Jian will transfer it back to Hu Xufeng for free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the market value of the Mujiangwang Village renovation project at that time, the proportion of pledged equity corresponding to the two loans of Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian did not conform to normal business logic. In the subsequent lengthy litigation, Hu Xufeng compared it to a &quot;snake swallowing an elephant&quot;, but did not provide a precise explanation for the abnormal equity pledge ratio. According to Hu Xufeng, he repeatedly asked for repayment of debts, but both creditors proposed to change the cooperation method, and the debt repayment was abandoned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/lm6tN82Qv6ijldU6z94DFvOHB4Ewn60YEuvNgeSH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1038&quot; height= &quot;778&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/lm6tN82Qv6ijldU6z94DFvOHB4Ewn60YEuvNgeSH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252273&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2023, 16 years after the project was launched, many unfinished buildings can be seen at the site of Mujiangwang Village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhai Xingli/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Forged signature&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In this regard, Hongrun Real Estate, which was originally 100% controlled by Hu Xufeng and his wife, is left with only Hu Xufeng&#39;s wife Chen and Hongrun Group holding a total of 7% of the shares. In March 2013, the legal representative of Hongrun Real Estate was changed from Hu Xufeng to Zhuyaojiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Hu Xufeng claimed that he only learned about the fact that only 7% of the equity was left in July 2014, more than two years after the loan agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his account, in the previous two years, he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, operated, and recovered. During the treatment, the capital chain of Hongrun Real Estate was broken. Although Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian jointly obtained Hongrun Real Estate 93% of the equity, but no further capital injection into the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng tried to restart the project. He went to the industrial and commercial department to inquire and found that on January 10, 2012, the industrial and commercial department received the application materials for registration of changes in equity interests of Hongrun Real Estate shareholders and approved the application on the 31st of that month. Registered the change of 75% of the equity of Hongrun Real Estate to Wang Jian&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the application materials, there is a &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012, which is the document recognized by the Supreme Court. The content is that the Hongrun Real Estate Shareholders Meeting has studied and approved the transfer of 75% of the equity. Transferred to Wang Jian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The date of the loan agreement between Wang Jian and Hongrun Real Estate is January 11, 2012. Hu Xufeng applied for an appraisal from the Judicial Appraisal Center of Northwest University of Political Science and Law. The appraisal opinion shows that the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on this shareholder transfer capital contribution agreement are not their own signatures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted Wang Jian after many attempts. Wang Jian responded via text message to a reporter from Southern Weekend: &quot;The whole lies and stories fabricated by Hu Xufeng have troubled me for more than ten years and caused a lot of pressure and shadow to me and my family. At present, there are irresistible problems in all aspects.&quot; Overturning the conclusion, I don’t want to be entangled with such social liars, ruffians, and scoundrels anymore, and I don’t want to explain anything in this matter. The government department will definitely come up with a conclusion about who committed the crime in violation of the law, but before the time comes, the company will go bankrupt. Everything will be revealed during liquidation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Wang Jian refused to explain the facts about his loan situation with Hu Xufeng, equity disputes and handwriting identification. He asked: &quot;He was really rich and capable back then. Do you want to engage in such a big project?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, Hu Xufeng and his wife took Hongrun Real Estate to court, claiming that the signatures on the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; were forged and completed without the knowledge of Hu&#39;s wife Chen. On the grounds that the transfer of 75% of the shares violated Chen’s right of first refusal, the court requested the court to invalidate the “Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement” and restore the industrial and commercial registration information of Hongrun Real Estate to the state before the change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 29, 2015, the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court made a verdict. The court found that the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on the &quot;Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 were not signed by the two of them, and Wang Jian himself had no objection to this. The court ruled that the agreement was invalid, but rejected the Hu Xufeng couple&#39;s other claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jian refused to accept the decision and appealed to the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. Wang Jian argued to the court that although the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 were not signed by the two of them, there was another agreement signed by Hongrun Real Estate on January 10. The &quot;Shareholders Meeting Resolution&quot; transferring 75% of the shares to Wang Jian has the signature of Hu Xufeng&#39;s wife Chen. Chen cannot prove that her signature is forged, so Chen knows and agrees to the agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly asked Hu Xufeng and his wife for verification. They insisted that the signature was not signed by Chen, but &quot;because the appraisal fee was very expensive and they were short of money at the time, they only authenticated the &quot;Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; &quot;The signature on the &quot;Shareholders&#39; Meeting Resolution&quot; was not authenticated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 25, 2015, the Shaanxi Provincial High Court made a judgment. The court found that after signing the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; on January 10, 2012, Hu Xufeng and his wife confirmed the authenticity of the agreement several times at the Hongrun Real Estate shareholders&#39; meeting and external agreements on March 15, 2013. The validity of the agreement was not raised and no objection was raised. Therefore, its appeal to determine that the agreement was invalid &quot;has no factual and legal basis and this court will not support it in accordance with the law.&quot; The second-instance judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court revoked the first-instance judgment of the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng refused to accept the lawsuit, and the lawsuit eventually went to the Supreme People&#39;s Court. On May 29, 2019, the Supreme People&#39;s Court issued (2017) Supreme Court Judgment No. 171, upholding the judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. However, the Supreme People&#39;s Court found that the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 was a pledge guarantee by changing the equity holder, and it did not have the effect of equity transfer because it was not the true expression of intention of the parties. As for both parties, &quot;whether the equity pledge in the loan relationship complies with legal regulations can be resolved through separate legal channels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Administrative Protest&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The reason why the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau became the defendant is also because of the above two signatures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng requested the court to order the bureau to cancel the change registration and re-register the shares under the name of Hongrun Group on the grounds that the bureau relied on the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; with forged signatures in the change registration. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case was assigned to the Xi&#39;an Xincheng District People&#39;s Court for trial. On July 8, 2016, Xincheng Court issued an administrative judgment. The court found that when the bureau reviewed the change registration application materials submitted by a third party, it did not find that the signatures on the shareholder capital contribution agreement were not made by the company&#39;s legal representative and shareholders. &quot;It was a flaw in the industrial and commercial change registration and did not affect the administration.&quot; the legality of the conduct”. Hu Xufeng lost the lawsuit. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Xi&#39;an Intermediate Court, which upheld the original verdict. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 18, 2019, Hu Xufeng filed a protest with the Xi’an Municipal People’s Procuratorate, and the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate supported the protest. The Shaanxi Provincial High Court ordered the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court to conduct a retrial. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the prosecutor of the Seventh Procuratorate Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate appeared in court to protest. According to the official website of the court, this is the first time that the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate has sent personnel to attend the retrial court for administrative protest cases after the internal institutional reform of the Shaanxi Provincial Procuratorate and the establishment of a separate administrative prosecution department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau argued that the law requires administrative agencies to conduct a formal review for the registration of changes in shareholder equity. The change application materials at that time were complete and met the formal requirements stipulated by the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Administrative Licensing Law, formal review is a concept corresponding to substantive review. Formal review refers to the review that the application materials submitted by the applicant are complete and in compliance with the legal form, while substantive review refers to the administrative agency’s review of the applicant. The authenticity and legality of the content of the materials provided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bureau argued that &quot;Although the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; was not signed by me, the content of the agreement represents the true intention of the parties, and there is evidence to prove that the facts of the agreement are recognized by both parties.&quot; In addition, although The Supreme People&#39;s Court determined that the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; is in the nature of an equity guarantee and does not have the effect of equity transfer, &quot;but it does not affect the outcome of the administrative case. Our bureau has fulfilled its reasonable review obligations and has no responsibility to revoke this administrative action.&quot; and obligations”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bureau emphasized to the court that administrative actions have conclusive power, and the registration of equity changes reflects the true meaning of Hongrun Real Estate’s equity transfer guarantee in appearance, and cannot antagonize bona fide counterparts. Likewise, it does not affect administrative matters. Effectiveness of behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng&#39;s litigation attorney objected, &quot;Equity transfer guarantee and equity pledge are two completely different legal relationships.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Civil Code, equity transfer guarantee means that the debtor transfers the equity to the name of the creditor. After the debtor pays off the debt when due, the creditor should return the equity to the debtor. Equity pledge can only obtain equity ownership after the debt matures through auction, (liquidation) or negotiation procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the finding in the Supreme Court&#39;s judgment that a pledge guarantee is made by changing the equity holder, it does not have the effect of equity transfer because it is not the true intention of the parties. The parties in the dispute case have argued that Each has its own understanding and expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 18, 2020, the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court issued a retrial verdict, and Hu Xufeng lost the case again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the application of law to the aforementioned two focus issues in this dispute, the Small and Medium Enterprises Business Environment Research Group of the Law School of Xi&#39;an University of Finance and Economics commissioned the Civil Law Research Society of the China Law Society on August 31, 2023. Four legal experts, namely Yang Lixin, vice president, Cui Jianyuan, vice president of the Civil Law Research Society of the China Law Society, Wang Xizhen, executive director of the Administrative Law Research Society of the China Law Society, and Wang Bo, dean of the Law School of Xi&#39;an University of Finance and Economics, organized the seminar and issued a legal Opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The legal opinions put forward by the experts at the meeting include: Hu Xufeng’s signature in the “Equity (East) Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement” dated January 10, 2012 is forged. This document is a false material, and any agreement based on this false material should be revoked. Administrative decision on the registration of change of equity transfer of Hongrun Real Estate; the agreement reached between Wang Jian and Hongrun Group is an equity transfer guarantee, not an equity pledge. If the aforementioned change registration is regarded as a valid equity transfer guarantee registration, Wang Jian will act as a creditor , has no right to exercise shareholder rights and can only receive priority repayment for the equity involved in the case; Hongrun Group, as the debtor and guarantor, has the right to request Wang Jian to return the equity and change the equity registration after repaying the loan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The final chapter is coming&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the dispute that lasted for more than ten years, the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project experienced unfinished work, changed hands, and the villagers many times During the petition, Southern Weekend reporters saw at the scene that there are still 10 buildings in unfinished condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from the villagers of Mujiangwang Village that around 2015, the government-funded relocation houses were delivered, and the last batch of villagers moved back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2015, the Xi&#39;an Bahe New District Management Committee changed the project subject from Hongrun Real Estate to Shaanxi Jiaxinyuan Industrial Co., Ltd. The government department advanced 140 million yuan to build some relocation houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The control of Hongrun Real Estate is still being contested by all parties. Zhu Yaojiang was sentenced by the Keqiao Court in 2017. According to the law, he can no longer serve as the legal representative of Hongrun Real Estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 13, 2017, the People&#39;s Court of Keqiao District, Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province issued the (2016) Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu No. 1377 Judgment. Zhu Yaojiang was sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment for the crime of embezzlement and illegal absorption of public deposits. 13 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are Hu Xufeng’s witness statements on pages 22 and 33 of this judgment. However, Hu Xufeng insisted that he was traveling between Xi&#39;an, Beijing and other places at the time and had not received any inquiries or evidence collection from Shaanxi or Zhejiang public prosecutors and law enforcement departments regarding the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on September 20, 2023, the Keqiao District People&#39;s Court responded to Southern Weekend reporters that after verification, during the handling of the case, the Economic Investigation Brigade of the High-tech Branch of the Xi&#39;an Public Security Bureau transferred 46 files along with it. A set of case materials, including Hu Xufeng&#39;s witness testimony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng’s sister said that on September 23, 2023, she contacted the police officer handling the case at the time, and the other party said that a report record had been made when Hu Xufeng reported the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report refers to the fact that in August 2014, Zhu Yaojiang’s sister was arrested by the Xi’an police on suspicion of illegally absorbing public deposits. Hu Xufeng reported to the Xi’an Public Security Bureau at that time that Zhu Yaojiang was the mastermind behind the case. Hu Xufeng produced the original reporting materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are crime report transcripts equivalent to witness statements submitted to the court? The policemen handling the case and Hu Xufeng each held their own opinions. However, (2016) Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu No. 1377 Judgment shows that Zhu Yaojiang was only criminally detained in November 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2017, Hui Xiping, then director of the Hongqi Subdistrict Office in Baqiao District, Xi&#39;an City, said in an interview with CCTV&#39;s &quot;News Investigation&quot; program that Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian collectively acquired 93% of the shares of Hongrun Real Estate. Later, it was discovered that the actual controller of Hongrun Real Estate was not these two people, but the aforementioned actual investor Li Bin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are different opinions about Li Bin’s life. Some media once quoted the article &quot;&quot;Luxury Monk&quot; Li Bin&quot; published in the 14th issue of &quot;China Entrepreneur&quot; magazine in 2007 to introduce his life. Southern Weekend reporters were unable to find the original text of the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned in Li Bin’s parents’ neighborhood that his father was a team worker at Xi’an Film Studio. He returned to his hometown in Mei County, Baoji City a few years ago. Li Bin also worked in Xi’an Film Production The factory worked briefly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as the relationship between Hu Xufeng and Li Bin is concerned, since losing control of Hongrun Real Estate, Hu Xufeng said that he can no longer contact Li Bin. After Hu Xufeng started litigation to defend his rights, Li Bin reported Hu Xufeng to the public security agency on the grounds of gang involvement. Hu Xufeng also publicly reported Li Bin with his real name for the same reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 25, 2019, the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department handed over to Xi&#39;an the clues that Hu Xufeng reported about Li Bin and others&#39; suspected crimes in the form of a Director&#39;s Supervision Order (Supervision of Crime Leads No. 044) Verification by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi’an Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that regarding the two people’s reports of each other, the public security organs did not find any illegal or criminal facts on both sides after a lot of work. Whistleblower”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a series of processes such as notarized delivery, convening of extraordinary shareholders&#39; meetings, and announcements, Hongrun Real Estate submitted materials for changing the legal representative to the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau in April 2022. The bureau issued a &quot;Notice of Refusal to Registration&quot; on August 22 of that year, rejecting the application for change of registration on the grounds that the identity of the convener of the shareholders&#39; meeting did not comply with the provisions of the Company Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the processing results alone, Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau did not support Hu Xufeng&#39;s application for change of registration, nor did it support the applications of Li Bin and Wang Jian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hongrun Real Estate then sued the bureau to the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Court. On December 30, 2022, the court issued a first-instance judgment in which Hongrun Real Estate won the case. The court ordered the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau to re-administer Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s change application within 60 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau was dissatisfied and appealed to the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Intermediate Court. On August 18, 2023, the second-instance court made a final judgment and upheld the original judgment. The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau lost the case again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that the bureau must re-administer the change application of Hongrun Real Estate within 60 days after the judgment takes effect. This equity war that has lasted for 9 years will come to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Note: The Xi&#39;an Municipal Public Security Bureau was interviewed about the transfer of Hu Xufeng&#39;s witness statement, and had exchanges with Wei Hua, deputy chief of the Information Section, The other party later asked for confirmation and there is a WeChat record.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
