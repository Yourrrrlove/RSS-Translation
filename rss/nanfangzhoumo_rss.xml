The announcement shows that the total investment in education funding nationwide in 2022 will be 6.132914 billion yuan, exceeding 6 trillion yuan for the first time, an increase of 5.97% over the previous year. The national financial education funding is 4.847291 billion yuan, an increase of 5.75% over the previous year, accounting for 4.01% of the GDP, and achieving &quot;generally no less than 4%.&quot; The national general public budget education funding was 3.925696 billion yuan, an increase of 4.79% over the previous year, accounting for 15.07% of the general public budget expenditure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the statistical announcement, the national average general public budget education funding based on the number of students in school in 2022 will be 15,731.97 yuan, an increase of 2.44% over the previous year. The growth rates of general public budget education funding per student in kindergartens, ordinary primary schools, ordinary junior high schools, ordinary high schools, secondary vocational schools, and ordinary colleges and universities across the country are: 7.29%, 3.32%, 2.14%, 1.64%, 2.14%, and -1.69% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 14:55:22 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[那些痴迷过山车的人：“事故是小概率事件”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261892]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73989&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70780&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9194657f29.jpeg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG239.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;2016, Busch Gardens Tampa, USA , the roller coaster &quot;Cheetah&quot;.

Photo by Xun Hang&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On National Day this year, Xun Hang completed the 480th roller coaster check-in in Europe. As a high-risk amusement equipment, roller coasters have a history of more than 100 years since their birth in the 19th century, and have been introduced to China for nearly 40 years. To some extent, they have become a reference for measuring the configuration level of an amusement park. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I don&#39;t have the most, some friends have more than 800.&quot; Xun Hang, 32, has been riding roller coasters for ten years. &quot;. He could not remember the details of his first roller coaster ride as a child. He only remembered that &quot;it felt like I was going to fly. It was very exciting and very happy.&quot; Since then, I have wanted to go to an amusement park every holiday, and every time I go to an amusement park, I must ride the roller coaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Among the many projects in amusement parks, most equipment is highly homogeneous, but roller coasters can be infinitely varied.&quot; In order to have a better and more experience It’s a rollercoaster. When he was a student, Xun Hang visited many cities in China. After working as an adult, he expanded his footprints to North America, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is difficult to explain to outsiders why my hobby is riding roller coasters. Around 2010, Xun Hang found several roller coaster fans like himself through some forums and forums. In order to keep warm and share information, they formed a fan group called &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot;. Thirteen years later, this small team, which started with just a few people, now has nearly 150 members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 27, 2023, an accident occurred at the roller coaster &quot;Snow Eagle&quot; project in Shenzhen Happy Valley. A roller coaster broke down after going uphill along the track. It slipped and collided with another roller coaster that had arrived at the station and was discharging passengers, resulting in 4 serious injuries and 13 minor injuries. In November, the State Administration for Market Regulation deployed a nationwide special investigation and management of hidden dangers of roller coaster accidents to resolutely prevent the recurrence of roller coaster accidents like the &quot;10·27&quot; roller coaster accident at Shenzhen Happy Valley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Despite major negative events, the enthusiasm of roller coaster fans has not diminished. Xun Hang noticed that most members of &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot; regarded the above-mentioned accidents as sporadic cases and regarded them as &quot;small probability events.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73962&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70753&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/86d66a1897.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;VCG111461504461.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On October 20, 2021, tourists at the Shenzhen Happy Valley roller coaster &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; kept screaming while playing.

Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;One in 17 million chance of injury&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is reported that the &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; roller coaster in Shenzhen Happy Valley , officially opened in July 2012, with a total of two trains. The track length of the car is 887 meters, with the highest point reaching 60 meters. It is one of the tallest and longest catapult roller coasters built in China. It can run at a speed of 135 kilometers per hour. It is also one of the fastest roller coasters built in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We didn&#39;t believe it at first, but later we realized it was true.&quot; Yang Kaichun, a member of &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot; said that the reason why he was surprised was because &quot; &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; has the &quot;very safe&quot; elements recognized by experienced players - brand parks, large-scale equipment and first-tier manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;23-year-old Yang Kaichun has experience riding nearly 200 roller coasters. The first time he rode a roller coaster, he was in sixth grade at Lotte World in South Korea. He was timid and reluctantly got on the roller coaster with the encouragement of his mother and the companionship of his younger brother. &quot;I sat down and took a lap and found that it was different from what I thought. Not only was it not scary, it was also very exciting. After sitting there, I was still unsatisfied and wanted to wait in line again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;This experience made Yang Kaichun have a strong interest in roller coasters. What is the control system of this unpowered car? How are the track paths designed? How to grasp human physiological limits during tumbling and spinning? How relevant is the human riding experience to the overall design? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to satisfy his curiosity, Yang Kaichun not only searched for roller coaster-related materials on the Internet, but also visited various parks at home and abroad. He even chose to go to college. majored in mechanical engineering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Roller coaster is a niche hobby, but Yang Kaichun has found many like-minded friends. In addition to sharing his experience on roller coasters, he also enjoys discussing the mechanical principles and control systems of roller coasters with like-minded people. &quot;It was a very pure and selfless exchange. Everyone didn&#39;t care whether they offended others. They just quarreled over an issue, but it didn&#39;t affect their feelings at all. Everyone purely loved roller coasters.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the &quot;October 27&quot; roller coaster accident at Shenzhen Happy Valley, a heated discussion started in the &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot; WeChat group. &quot;The discussion started mainly at the technical level, and everyone speculated that there might be a problem with the anti-retraction device.&quot; Xun Hang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xun Hang said that among the members of &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot;, some may reduce the frequency of riding similar roller coasters from the same manufacturer in the near future, but overall, &quot;the It’s time to go to the amusement park to visit the amusement park.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past ten years of riding experience on hundreds of roller coasters, these roller coaster fans claim that they have never encountered personal safety incidents, which makes them believe that roller coasters The safety is very high. &quot;If the probability of an accident on an airplane is much lower than driving to the airport (the probability of an accident), then the probability of an accident on a roller coaster is also much lower than driving to the amusement park.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xunhang brushed 480 cars. He only experienced a bumpy ride caused by the uneven track of the roller coaster, which &quot;knocked his knees red&quot;; fans both (pseudonyms) brushed the cars More than 320 vehicles have never experienced a &quot;risk situation&quot;, but they encountered service personnel buckling their shoulders but not wearing seat belts when riding in a car, and did not carry out &quot;double insurance&quot;; Yang Kaichun brushed 200 vehicles and experienced this in the United States. During a &quot;hanging parking&quot;, the car climbed to the highest point and got stuck. Finally, under the command of the park management staff, everyone collectively &quot;jumped&quot; forward before continuing to &quot;start&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The safety of roller coasters reflected in individual experience also has some objective basis. According to statistics from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions in October 2023, the probability of people being injured on amusement equipment is about 3.7 times per million people, which is lower than playing football, swimming, cycling, etc. Based on a three-year average, the probability of someone being injured on a fixed theme park ride is one in 17 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;If the vehicle hovers in the preset area, or encounters collisions, etc., these are common problems that will not cause safety issues for passengers. Not only are we not afraid , such as hovering, sometimes I hope to experience it and enrich the riding experience.&quot; Xun Hang said. Other roller coaster enthusiasts interviewed were similar to Xun Hang in their identification of roller coaster safety risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, in the eyes of professionals, hovering is not always a &quot;common problem&quot; even if it does not cause casualties. &quot;Under normal circumstances, if passengers hover in a normal position, there will be no safety problems. However, if the hovering time is too long, or if the hovering is upside down with the head down, many parks will pay special attention to it, and even if the situation is serious, Report it to the national competent authority,&quot; said Han Zhiyi, a well-known theme park executive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Huanjie, president of the China Theme Park Research Institute, reminded that whether it is a small problem or a major accident, tourists should maintain their safety when riding a roller coaster and encounter unexpected situations such as hovering. Stay calm and wait patiently for guidance and rescue from the staff. Do not shake the car violently out of excitement and panic. &quot;Because people&#39;s excessive reactions may affect the equipment&#39;s ability to handle emergency situations according to the design plan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73963&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70754&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/dcbccc433c.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;VCG111454610890.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;September 17, 2023 local time, A roller coaster at the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany.

On September 16, two roller coasters collided at the Munich Oktoberfest, injuring eight people. Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Every car has a new experience” &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different from the short-lived stimulating experience that ordinary tourists occasionally ride on a roller coaster, The experience gained by these experienced players from high-frequency car brushing seems to better capture the designer&#39;s intention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I think roller coasters are the epitome of contemporary human wisdom. Whether roller coasters are excellent or not often tests the artistic aesthetics, manufacturing technology, scientific and technological level of designers and manufacturers, and even medicine. Common sense.&quot; Xun Hang said. He believes that the wonderful thing about roller coasters is that almost every car has a new experience, and even the same car has a different feeling every time it is ridden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the National Day holiday this year, Xun Hang rode a catapult-type spinning roller coaster in Belgium. In his opinion, this car not only combines two seemingly unrelated elements of spin and electromagnetic ejection, but also relies on the up and down track to allow riders to experience ejection one after another. &quot;The car body is always spinning irregularly, and you never seem to know what the next spin will feel like.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This roller coaster also has an electromagnetic section In the ejection area, the vehicle travels to the second section. Relying on a vertical undulating slope section, the roller coaster accelerates while losing weight. There are also tumbling elements interspersed in the middle, making people feel like they are in a washing machine. The overall feeling was hearty and comfortable, so much so that Xun Hang &quot;swiped it 8 times a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Compared with the feeling of pushing back and explosive power, I especially prefer the feeling of weightlessness brought by roller coasters. The heart feels like being pulled up, and people will experience a kind of weightlessness. The ultimate pleasure.&quot; Xun Hang said. This ride experience in Belgium greatly satisfied his preference for weightlessness, so it became his &quot;favorite&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for Yang Kaichun, in addition to the ultimate riding experience, he also hopes to know what is happening and why. All aspects related to the roller coaster riding experience will become his exploration issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of the appearance of the track, the material used is often hard steel, but when it forms the winding and circling track of the roller coaster, it appears smooth and smooth, and the overall appearance A kind of beauty that combines strength and softness. The track construction of some large-scale parks can often become landmark buildings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a vehicle without power, the riding experience of a roller coaster is often closely related to the direction of the track. Under different logics, designers need to consider not only whether the passengers will The physical safety of being dropped also needs to consider what physiological reactions a person will have as their physical position changes under a given sprint, rotation or gravity acceleration, and explore the safety margin of this reaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Under a given acceleration of gravity, a person&#39;s body may be suspended in the air, or as if he is flying, or as if he is climbing on top of a boulder... I am very curious about this kind of How do you create a safe, moderate but exciting feeling?&quot; Yang Kaichun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Both like the ups and downs of riding a roller coaster, and can also immerse themselves in the fun of different themes. Parks in different countries will have different themes when building roller coasters. For example, most Chinese parks will incorporate some traditional cultural elements, while European and American parks will be linked to Disney, Marvel and other styles. Along with lighting, VR, water spray and other effects, riding a roller coaster is often like experiencing a &quot;fantasy journey&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More often, they simply like the happiness brought by roller coasters. This kind of happiness is not only brought by physical stimulation, but also by the excitement surrounding them. A happy atmosphere. &quot;Whether you are watching the roller coaster or riding the roller coaster, everyone is very happy. Seeing so many happy smiling faces makes you happy too.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73988&quot; group- id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70779&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e246b49bf9.jpeg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG230.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;In 2016, the roller coaster &quot;El Toro&quot; at Six Flags Great Adventure in the United States.

Photo by Xun Hang&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“China’s safety standards are stricter”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Car fans believe that their trust in the safety of roller coasters does not arise blindly . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As an iconic amusement facility that has gone through a century of history, roller coasters have corresponding safety standards for their production, installation, operation, maintenance, and retirement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Huanjie introduced that at present, domestic large-scale roller coasters are mainly imported. Such equipment must be submitted to China&#39;s special equipment testing agency for review during the design stage. Place an order for production, and a dedicated person needs to be assigned to supervise on-site during the production process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the roller coaster is installed, it needs to complete a certain hour of testing in accordance with the manufacturer&#39;s requirements, and then conduct an idling test and load test again in accordance with China&#39;s national standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the equipment declaration and operation stage, the regulatory authorities will not only review the filing materials, but also conduct on-site testing of the equipment. After completion, the trial operation qualification will be issued first. During this period, no safety problems will occur, and then the formal operation qualification will be given. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the official operation, in addition to regular inspections such as daily inspection, monthly inspection, and annual inspection, the roller coaster will also conduct safety management and maintenance of the equipment in accordance with the requirements of the manufacturer. Welcome the random inspection by the superior unit of the park and the corresponding regulatory department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Corresponding to the aforementioned security defense lines, there is a series of institutional documents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many interviewees mentioned that when it comes to the management of roller coasters, China’s safety standards are stricter than those in countries such as Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea. &quot;For example, when we play in China, we are generally not allowed to bring backpacks, mobile phones, keys and other items, but in European and American countries, they are more casual and don&#39;t care much.&quot; Yang Kaichun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Huanjie believes that safety problems in roller coasters are generally related to front-end design flaws, mid-end detection loopholes, and inadequate follow-up operation and maintenance. In reality, &quot;it is difficult for a large-scale accident to occur if there is a simple flaw in a certain link. Safety problems are often caused by the accumulation of layer-by-layer failures in multiple security inspection links.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the interviewees related to the operation and management of the park said that the safety issues of roller coasters in the real environment are often related to whether the operator strictly follows the Provisions are made to implement inspection, maintenance and upkeep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For example, in order to save money, some operators do not replace some parts that should be replaced, do not repair those that should be repaired, and do not repair some equipment that should be overhauled; Some problems are also related to unprofessional operators, who cannot detect problems, or it is difficult to strictly enforce regulations during peak seasons.&quot; A professional close to a special equipment testing agency revealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In November 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation launched a nationwide safety inspection of roller coasters, which emphasized the need to consolidate the manufacturing, operation and use of large-scale amusement facilities. The main responsibility for unit safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, whether the management and operation of the equipment are professional and standardized is also related to the scale and conditions of the park where the equipment is located. Many interviewees said that in some cities, small parks, street parks, carnival venues, etc., because most of the equipment are non-first-line brands, and there are fewer passengers, the management and operation are also relatively loose. In comparison, the stability of the equipment and poor security. Respondents do not recommend riding roller coasters in some overseas countries that rely on human traction, roller coasters that are old and rusty in appearance, or roller coasters that have a high rate of bumps and complaints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When safety incidents occur on roller coasters, passengers sometimes bear some responsibility. &quot;It happened once before. Because there was a lot of cash in the bag, a tourist took the bag from the locker on the platform to the foot of the car at the moment of departure after depositing the bag. As a result, when the car flipped over, the bag was hit upside down. Passengers in the back.&quot; Han Zhiyi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, the aforementioned professionals also introduced that the roller coaster track is equipped with multiple highly sensitive sensors, and sometimes small objects dropped by passengers can be broken into as foreign objects. Identification, affecting the regular operation of the roller coaster. However, Lin Huanjie said that among the many roller coaster problems, the probability of them being triggered by tourists is extremely small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xun Hang believes that some people currently have some misunderstandings about roller coasters, such as equating roller coasters with extreme sports, or equating excitement with danger, but &quot;this project It’s about experiencing excitement, not looking for conventional comfort.” In his opinion, in most cases, riding a roller coaster is safe and can bring people some ultimate pleasure. &quot;We hope that everyone can understand it more comprehensively and enjoy it more relaxedly.&quot; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多近的关系，才应该给份子钱？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261890]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, there has been a lot of talk about molecular money.

Living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to media reports, in some Haidilao stores, as long as the customer says &quot;I want a subject three&quot;, there will be &quot;professional waiters&quot; to perform a magical dance, with the dynamic music shows the dynamic music show shaking flowers The dance of hands, twisting waist, and swinging, this is the &quot;three dances&quot; on the short video platform. In response to &quot;Nine School Finance&quot;, Haidilao also said that Haidilao has always encouraged store partners to use their own specialty and customer needs to innovate, and set up corresponding innovation incentive mechanisms. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I can&#39;t help but be emotional. Nowadays, the catering service of Haidilao has become more and more developed to the &quot;ancient dance banquet&quot;. Customers alone feel that &quot;the banquet is not happy&quot;, I hope &quot;Dance with help&quot; or enjoy other special services, turning the hot pot into &quot;Zhong Ming Ding Shi&quot; and &quot;Han Xizai Night Banquet&quot;. The active encouragement of the store and the pole response of the audience itself has explained a lot of problems, and it is worthy of detailed analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, the &quot;human settings&quot; set by Haidilao can be described as consistent, which is the thoughtful and intimate diversified special service to satisfy the emotional value other than the customer&#39;s taste buds. Bring more happiness to customers. &quot; This &quot;human setting&quot; of this characteristic service has also caused a lot of imitation in the catering industry. &quot;God -like service&quot; has become the most distinctive label of Haidilao. There has been a saying that &quot;Haidilao You can&#39;t learn&quot;, which shows that Haidilao&#39;s development is &quot;continuously evolved&quot; in order to &quot;maintain people&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Looking at the iterative road of Haidilao&#39;s characteristic services, from the &quot;first -generation special services&quot; of nails, poker, free snacks, origami meal fees, to the staff singing birthday songs, sending dolls with individual diners This kind of &quot;advanced service&quot;, then to the later &quot;help children&quot;, &quot;help change PPT&quot; or even &quot;open stay&quot;, can be described as &quot;more and more rolled&quot; and &quot;more and more fight&quot;. The response also rose all the way. The topic of Haidilao this year is not only &quot;waiter dancing&quot;, but also special services such as &quot;recruiting bus car pick -up&quot; and &quot;free shampooing for customers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Recently, the hot search title of &quot;the number of people queuing up to dancing Haidilao has risen to 500 people&quot; and &quot;waiter dancing to get 3,000 yuan reward&quot; also shows that Haidilao&#39;s characteristic services are itself a topic marketing Or event marketing. Haidilao&#39;s new special services can always be searched on the news again and again. While bringing traffic and free advertisements to themselves, in turn, it also solidifies Haidilao&#39;s &quot;special service&quot;. Continue to &quot;evolve&quot; on the way to encourage the waiters to make more attempts to meet the differentiated needs of customers&#39; discerning and even wonderful differentiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, Haidilao&#39;s characteristic and event marketing roads are not unobstructed along the way, and there will always be some controversy. &quot;Waiters refused to celebrate their birthdays for their dolls&quot;, &quot;Haidilao stayed in tourist special soldiers affects customers&#39; meals&quot; often appeared, which shows the contradictions in it: Many customers are enjoying them, enjoying it, and some customers are unbearable. Its disturbance and complaint. There is also a voice in the public opinion field that Haidilao should &quot;return to the dining service base&quot;, appropriately suppress &quot;excessive service&quot; and &quot;over -entertainment&quot;, and avoid &quot;brand image damage&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But as everyone knows, Haidilao has achieved two -way screening with the consumer group with continuous iterative special services. Recently, the hot search &quot;Women&#39;s 9 -year spending nearly 270,000 to eat Haidilao&quot; shows that compared to customers who &quot;talk&quot; or even &quot;alarm&quot;, Haidilao is more willing to screen out &quot;loyal users&quot; and use the characteristics of a round of characteristics of a round of characteristic services With event marketing, strengthen the loyalty of these customers, and serve the basic disk. Haidilao creates its own settings that are different from other catering brands. It is also to further create more topic effects and achieve the effect of event marketing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a merchant, Haidilao enjoys independent management rights, has the right to decide &quot;how to provide goods and services&quot;, and also have the right to adjust the rules and scope of services, integrate the &quot;waiter dancing&quot; into its &quot;real -time processing, commercial sales, commercial sales Business category with service labor &quot;. As long as the waiter dances does not violate laws and regulations, Haidilao encourages the waiter to dance. The result may be to screen out those customers who are disgusted dancing. More people who like to watch dancing are more likely. As for this, the source value of the screening of the customer is not worth it, whether the brand image is damaged, and the decision -making power is also in the hands of Haidilao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many netizens suggest that Haidilao may be divided into &quot;singing dancing areas&quot; and &quot;quiet dining area&quot;. This proposal represents a considerable number of customers who &quot;just want to eat quietly&quot; customers. They may still love Haidilao&#39;s catering and other special services, but they just sing and dance. How to take care of the needs of these customers in Haidilao? Whether this part of customers will not be able to eat in pain because of this, everything should be given to Haidilao to decide how to choose. Whether it is a special person set or event marketing, it has not been separated from its own operating rights. The category of categories is just to do not catch a cold and even feel noisy and annoying customers such as &quot;subject three&quot;, I am afraid that it will stay away from Haidilao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx. run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打不过就加入，年轻人成了抢秋裤的主力军]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261004]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-05 08:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[威慑“致使他人感染艾滋病”的违法犯罪行为，是阻断传播的有力之举丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261848]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-04 23:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; According to the Beijing News, on November 26, the Beijing CDC released the city&#39;s latest AIDS The epidemic situation. According to reports, from January to October 2023, there were 1,404 newly rested in Beijing infected people and patients, a decrease of 3.97%compared with the same period last year; 95.51%of the propaganda transmission in new cases, of which male homosexual behavior spread 71.94%, and men&#39;s homosexual behavior was 71.94%. The heterosexual transmission was 23.58%; the other channels were 4.49%. At present, a total of 27,285 infected people and patients are survived in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This statistics are worthy of in -depth analysis. It can be seen that the current transmission of AIDS in Beijing is still dominated by sex, occupying the absolute majority of 95 %. This has followed the trend of many years, that is, in the three major ways of communication of AIDS, &quot;Sex, Blood, Mother and Baby&quot;, ordinary people are the most likely &quot;sexual transmission&quot; ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the propaganda and education of Chinese and foreign prevention of AIDS communication, it is indispensable to call for the content of being cleaned up and taking safety measures, such as the &quot;ABC principle&quot; of &quot;control sexual desire, loyalty to partners, and condoms&quot;. However, the traditional values ​​that promote &quot;control&quot; and &quot;loyalty&quot; lack forced force and lack of deterrent power. Promote the use of condoms and popularize HPV vaccines, but it is only a technical means to cure the standards. Once the parties embrace the values ​​of &quot;sexual freedom&quot;, can they still take safety measures? In other words, at least to inform the sexual partner to inform the obligation and quickly block the spread of virus? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; How to further prevent AIDS communication is not only the &quot;propaganda education&quot; in the traditional sense, but to do more in legislation and law enforcement to adapt to the new situation in the current situation of AIDS. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Article 38 of the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations stipulates that the infection of AIDS virus and patients have the obligation to &quot;inform those of the facts of the infection or onset in time&quot;; Article 62 stipulates Or if AIDS patients deliberately spread AIDS, they are liable for civil compensation in accordance with the law; if a crime is constituted, the criminal liability shall be investigated in accordance with the law; Article 77 of the &quot;Control of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; also stipulates that the unit and individuals violate the law, which will lead to the spread of infectious diseases and the spread of infectious diseases. If it is popular and causes damage to others&#39; lives and property, it shall bear civil liability according to law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the dissemination of AIDS in the &quot;failed to notify the obligation&quot; is still there, and there is still some distance between whether it should bear criminal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2017, the two highs of the two highs of the &quot;Explanation of Several Issues of Organization, Compulsion, Lure, tolerance, Introduction to Prostitution Criminal Cases&quot; stipulates that &quot;knowing that he knows that he is infected with AIDS virus and deliberately does not take precautions. The &quot;situation of the&quot; serious injury &quot;referred to in Article 95 of the Criminal Law can be identified as the&quot; serious injury &quot;of measures in the case of sexual relations with others. If there is sex with others but does not cause others to be infected, it only needs to bear civil liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The privacy of AIDS should not nor higher than the health of their partners and spouses. The marriage and family editor of the &quot;People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; have affirmed the obligation of &quot;disclosure of major illnesses before marriage&quot; with legislation, which is of course related to major AIDS. If HIV carriers or patients fail to fulfill their obligations, the victims can ask for a cancellation of marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On January 12, 2023, the Supreme Law announced a number of typical cases of civil law. Among them, &quot;Lin complained about Zhang&#39;s cancellation of marriage&quot;: Lin Zhang was registered for marriage through a blind date. After marriage, Zhang confessed to Lin for many years. Lin claimed to the court that the marriage was invalid or canceled the marriage, and the court sentenced to revocation of the marriage relationship between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But the question is that it is easy to revoke the civil relationship between marriage, and who should be responsible for infection with AIDS? In the cases of &quot;deliberately having sexual relationships with others, maliciously spreading AIDS&quot;, should the law still protect their privacy and sexual rights? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For this reason, the judicial community is also trying to make some attempts. Article 20 of the &quot;Regulations on the Prevention and Control of AIDS in Yunnan Province&quot;, which is implemented from March 1, 2021, stipulates that &quot;infected people and patients should inform their spouse or sexual partners in time to inform the facts of infection with AIDS virus; The right to notify. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This legislation is a breakthrough that shows the consideration of the privacy of the people&#39;s health on the Privacy of AIDS. However, it still does not solve the problem of &quot;how to inform&quot; and &quot;whether there is an obligation&quot; for medical and health institutions, nor does it break through the Privacy Terms of the AIDS Prevention Regulations. Technically, there are many cases of &quot;non -marriage and non -fixed partners&quot;. How can medical and health institutions notify one by one? How to further increase the deterrent of such behaviors is worth further investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since the two -high judicial explanation positions the behavior of &quot;causing others to infection with AIDS&quot; as &quot;serious injury&quot;, then there is no reason for the law without severe punishment for prostitution. The behavior of the law is bound to be greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, justice can be clear that if the parties know that they have carried AIDS virus and do not inform and have sexual relationships with anyone else, they are maliciously harmful to others and cause injuries with deliberate injuries. According to Article 234 of the Criminal Law, the punishment criteria for imprisonment of less than three years or less, attempt, that is, if it is not infected, it is light or reduce the punishment. Fortune of the subject protects potential victims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In short, further prevention and treatment of AIDS can not be limited to promoting and educating those &quot;ABCD&quot; principles, or counting on technical means to check the leakage, letting the law grow to teeth, and deteriorate the illegal crime that &quot;cause others to infect AIDS&quot;. The behavior is a more powerful move to block the pathway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[低调收官，女性群像剧不香了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261801]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-04 21:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p data-mpa-mpa-popered-by = &quot;yiban.io&quot;>; &lt;span>; The 2023 Employment Blue Book shows that the proportion of graduates in the past five years has risen, from 43%to 47%. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; This reflects the new choices of young people: they all say, &quot;The hometown cannot pretend to be the body, and the soul of his hometown cannot be allowed.&quot; &lt;/span>; &lt;span>; &amp; nbsp; &lt;/spsp; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; A big city with better resources symbolizes ambitions and ambitions; The seductive &quot;nostalgia&quot; points to a more comfortable life. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/64544E07F7F7A76E17DE74.PNG&quot; Border = &quot;0&quot; style &quot;style = &quot; opacity: 1; &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 606 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04ddddd4544f7f7a76e17De74. png &quot;data-key =&quot; 260590 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Film and television creation is based on this, forming two momentum of the trial: one of the wandering of other peoples, tap their bitterness, struggle and embarrassment; another focus on young people Return to the hometown, dig out their emotions and motivations for returning home, and set off in their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For example, the female group portrait drama &quot;I am pretty good in his hometown&quot; (2021) and &quot;Hometown, don&#39;t come without it&quot; (2023), two &quot;sisters&quot;.

These soil -flavored micro -short dramas have emerged in domestic social media, and they have become the favorite of foreigners. The micro -short drama is dense, sweet, ups and downs, and it only makes people unable to stop. Data show that the number of micro -short dramas in my country in 2022 was close to 2,800, an increase of 600%over 2021. The myth of wealth of &quot;Great President of Battle to the Sea and Entering Millions of Daily&quot; has also begun to spread. With the situation of Cyclonus, there are many chaos: rough system, malicious drainage, and three views. When the special rectification is a messy and disorderly micro -short drama, what will this industry leave in the end?</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 21:25:57 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
