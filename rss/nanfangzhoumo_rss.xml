The losses include the Russian Black Sea Fleet&#39;s Ropcha-class landing ship &quot;Minsk&quot; and the Kilo-class diesel-powered submarine &quot;Rostov-on-Don&quot; which cost up to US$300 million and was commissioned in 2014. Rostov-on-Don). Satellite images of the scene showed that the two ships were severely damaged and were extremely difficult and expensive to repair. Considering that such a project was difficult to complete under the wartime system, they basically had to be scrapped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russia also admitted that it was attacked by Ukrainian missiles and that some ships were damaged. The situation announced by both sides basically confirmed the results of this attack. This is the largest loss suffered by the Black Sea Fleet since the sinking of the flagship Moskva after the war between Russia and Ukraine. It also sets a record for the first time in history that a submarine is hit by a missile. What’s even more amazing is that just two days after this attack, Ukraine announced that it had used missiles and drones to attack the S-400 air defense missile system on the Crimean Peninsula. This system has always been considered the strongest in Russia. Currently in active air defense weapons, Turkey even had tense relations with the United States and NATO in order to purchase this system. This time, it was beheaded by Ukraine behind enemy lines in actual combat, which was shocking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This round of continuous attacks with a combination of punches is obviously not the result of an accident, but a joint military operation between the Ukrainian intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense, in which the actions of the Ukrainian special forces can be said to be indispensable. without. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before launching the missile attack, that is, on September 11, the Ukrainian intelligence agency announced that the special forces had successfully seized two offshore oil and gas drilling platforms in the Black Sea and successfully removed Russian equipment from the platforms. military installations. The map shows that the two platforms captured by the Ukrainian special forces are about fifty kilometers away from the Crimean coastline. The Russian army has set up air and sea warning radars on them to control the Black Sea area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This attack did not attract much attention from domestic public opinion. Some media even believed that it was a political show after Ukraine’s counterattack failed, because the battle to seize the two platforms was not fierce and not too big. military value. However, in my opinion, the battle to seize the sea platform is the prelude to this attack, because Ukraine does not have stealth fighter equipment that can penetrate the enemy&#39;s air defense network, so it must try to shorten the reaction time of the opponent&#39;s air defense weapons, and these two This platform happens to be Russia&#39;s peripheral observation point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the start of the 2003 Iraq War, the U.S. military used special forces to successfully seize three Iraqi offshore drilling platforms in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, it is to prevent Iraq from dumping oil into the Persian Gulf and polluting the environment like it did during the Gulf War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the operation that year, in addition to the British and American special forces, the Polish Thunder Special Task Force also assumed the offensive mission of a platform. This kind of battle to seize maritime platforms is referred to as VBSS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Visit, board, search and seize&lt;/span>;) in the field of special operations. VBSS The mission is often only accomplished by elite maritime special operations units. The complexity of such operations lies in the fact that it involves combat maneuvers from underwater to the surface, and also includes extremely close indoor combat. It not only requires a large amount of pre-war reconnaissance, but also requires a large amount of targeted actual combat training by operational units before they can make up their minds to implement it. This kind of maritime point-taking operation generally cannot be just a political statement mission, because the risks and costs are too high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the missile attack two days later that Ukraine&#39;s action to seize the Black Sea drilling platform is only part of its huge action plan. In fact, the follow-up actions are the key to victory. After the submarine and landing ship were attacked by missiles, Ukraine launched a missile attack one day later. The battle rhythm seemed not compact enough. But in fact, the U.S. special forces did not delay after seizing the platform. Another attack team quietly landed on the Crimean Peninsula under the cover of night, approached the submarines and landing ships in the shipyard, and used thermal imaging Shoot it from multiple angles. After the attack, these latent special operations personnel conducted reconnaissance and assessment of the bombing effects before quietly withdrawing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because air-launched missile attacks involve issues with the angle of incidence, it is necessary to construct a three-dimensional image of the target, and the inspection needs to confirm its radar information or thermal imaging information, all of which require multi-angle technical reconnaissance. The United States may be able to rely on its powerful satellite and reconnaissance aircraft platforms for reconnaissance. For Ukraine, which lacks technical reconnaissance means, using special forces or covert operators to conduct close reconnaissance is a good alternative. And even for a country like the United States with strong technical reconnaissance capabilities, close-in reconnaissance by special forces is still one of the optional methods. For example, during the Gulf War, the United States sent multiple special operations teams into Iraq in order to find Iraqi Scud missiles. Conduct close reconnaissance from the rear. In addition, for collecting the signal characteristics of enemy air defense weapons, deploying special operations personnel for close detection is also a very feasible method, because with only a set of signal receivers, these lurking personnel can obtain the spectrum information of surrounding warning radars for a long time , and can also obtain more comprehensive signal intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe that the emergence of drones can replace special operations personnel, but in fact it is people, not machines, who win wars. Only when the quality of people matches technical means can we defeat powerful opponents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 20:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10人遇难，强龙卷风突袭江苏后，救灾与保险赔付正进行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257406]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/d0f40bac84.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d0f40bac84. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, the scene of the tornado disaster in Nancai Township, Suqian City.

This sudden disaster hit parts of Suqian City and Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province on September 19, 2023. According to official reports from the two places, a total of 10 people were killed and 8 injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days later, on Liyuan Road, Nancai Township, Suqian City, Li Peng had been immersed in picking up all kinds of debris at home and in the supermarket, and cleaning the passage; in another town in the city, Daxing Town North Street, a 68-year-old Chen Jianqiang climbed up to the roof of his house, collected the tiles blown by the tornado, and prepared to re-roof the roof. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two-kilometer-long Nancai Township South Street has generally returned to its usual order. Downed trees and broken glass have been cleared away, and temporary stalls are ready to be set up. Among the photos provided by local residents on the 20th, only the pears on the small truck were half burnt and blackened by the high-voltage cables that fell on the day of the tornado, and they were still stacked neatly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this tornado, the tornadoes in Daxing Town, Suyu District, Suqian City and Nancai Township, Economic Development Zone were EF2, and the tornadoes in Lupu Town and Banhu Town, Funing County, Yancheng City were EF3. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Service Center’s official Weibo account “Jiangsu Meteorology”, the intensity of tornadoes is divided into levels from EF0 to EF5. Tornadoes of level EF2 and above are generally called strong tornadoes, and tornadoes of level EF2 are generally called strong tornadoes. It can cause considerable damage, it can uproot trees; an EF3 tornado can even knock over a train. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Suqian, tornadoes are not a common natural disaster and they come and go quickly. In Yancheng, according to the Propaganda Department of the Funing County Party Committee in Yancheng City, an average of 4.8 tornadoes occur in Jiangsu every year, of which 2.6 occur in Yancheng. Yancheng is the urban area with the highest frequency of occurrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I was so scared at that moment”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the tornado hit at around 5 o’clock in the evening on September 19, Luo Qi was picking up his children from school and did not notice it. figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I got home, the street was in a mess. Luo Qi saw that on South Street, electric wires were blazing and cars were on fire. There is a small market on the street every day, right in front of Luo Qi&#39;s house. One of the sheds in front of her house was blown away and disappeared, and the other one was tied to a tree with a rope, but it hit the freezer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Qi checked the surveillance video at home and found that the three minutes before the tornado struck were unusually calm, with only light rain falling. Starting at 17:11, the surveillance video recorded a loud wind noise, and the shed at the door was blown. Then the wind became louder and louder, a red four-corner tent floated by the roadside, the big box was blown away, and all the small objects on the ground began to fly everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Qi said that the child&#39;s grandmother was washing vegetables at the door. When she saw something was wrong and wanted to go back into the house, the tricycle was blown up by the wind and pushed against the wall. The car window glass penetrated her elbows and feet, and she went to the hospital that night for stitches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stall owner next to Luo Qi’s house was not so lucky. He was picked up by the wind and fell to the other side of the road. At that time, a wrist-thick main cable suddenly fell down on the street, bursting into flames, and everyone was afraid of being electrocuted. &quot;I was so frightened at that moment.&quot; Luo Qi said that it was the first time in more than 30 years that she had seen such a violent tornado. The stall owner&#39;s wife kept asking for help, but no one dared to rescue her. Later, the police cordoned off the scene, and the cables were still on fire after the power was artificially cut off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Liyuan Road, which intersects with South Street, Li Peng opened a small supermarket. In his memory, the tornado lasted no more than a few minutes. But in those few minutes, the tornado tore off almost all the roofs on both sides of the street. &quot;Those asbestos tiles and sheds were hanging in the sky, as high as an airplane, blowing everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Peng’s home is a 16-year-old tile-roofed house. Since the house has never had any problems before, Li Peng has not reinforced or renovated the house. The tile-roofed house suffered heavy losses in this tornado. The roof kept leaking and the furniture and doors inside were smashed. &quot;I haven&#39;t calculated the amount of damage. I can only make detailed statistics when repairs start.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the tornado moved all the way to Daxing Town, it was already around 6 o&#39;clock. Fante, a 14-year-old girl, just came home from school. She saw a black thing slowly rolling up from a distance. &quot;It seemed to be connected to the sky, very long.&quot; During dinner, the lights at home flickered on and off, and soon the power went out. A strong wind blew into Fanter&#39;s house. Grandma went to block the two glass doors, but she couldn&#39;t close them. Fanter ran to help, &quot;but there was a strong suction that sucked me to the door and blew me into the tree.&quot; Fanter, who weighed 85 pounds, hugged the big tree outside the door and did not dare to move. He did not come down along the trunk until the wind stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Jiangsu Weather&quot; news on September 20, Jiangsu was affected by two tornadoes on September 19. The first tornado was in Suqian Economic Development Zone and Daxing Town from 17:00 to 18:00; the other was in Funing County, Yancheng City from 20:16 to 35:00. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official public account of the Suqian Emergency Management Bureau, the tornado disaster mainly occurred in towns and villages, with densely populated areas, complex building structures, and the occurrence period coincided with off-duty hours. According to preliminary statistics, 5,512 people were affected by the strong tornado, 1,646 houses were generally damaged, 137 houses collapsed, 41.8 hectares of crops were damaged, 405 people were temporarily relocated, and some walls of more than 2,000 square meters of pig houses collapsed and the roof collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/9a3ba8adc3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/9a3ba8adc3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251666&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the roadside in Nancai Township, electric workers are repairing lines. Visual China Picture &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Public housing insurance is verifying compensation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Wei, assistant captain of Suqian Blue Sky Rescue Team, told Southern Weekend Reporter, a common disaster in Suqian is heavy rain. Relatively speaking, tornadoes occur more frequently in Yancheng City. The private rescue teams along the Jiangsu coast have conducted targeted training on thunderstorms and hurricanes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 6 pm on the 19th, 13 members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team rushed to Nancai Township, Economic Development Zone. The local fire rescue team had arrived at the scene. The Blue Sky Team members assisted in clearing down fallen trees and scattered debris. etc., to open up a smooth road; at the same time, we checked the power supply lines to prevent secondary disasters such as leakage. &quot;We continued working until two o&#39;clock in the morning the next day.&quot; Road cleanup in Nancai Township was basically completed on the 20th. Suqian Blue Sky Rescue Team sent 12 reinforcements to Daxing Town in the afternoon to investigate the disaster situation, mainly assisting township staff to verify whether there were any people who had lost contact after the disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Wei said that after the tornado passes through, another task is to clean up the debris on the facade of the building. For example, the air conditioner on the edge of the eaves was blown to the outside of the bracket and needs to be adjusted. The severely damaged roof There are broken tiles on the floor, which should be cleaned as soon as possible. &quot;Prevent the heavy rain after the tornado from falling down the originally skewed items, causing secondary disasters.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Chen Jianqiang and his wife, residents of North Street in Daxing Town, the main problem is that after the roof tiles are broken, How to fall asleep at night. Daughter Chen Guo said that the roof of her parents&#39; house had just been renovated a few days ago, and they spent three to four thousand yuan to replace it with new tiles. Unexpectedly, the tornado ripped through most of the roof, and the electrical appliances in the house were also soaked in rain all night. Fortunately, the corridor was made of hard cement boards, so the two old men laid several layers of quilts on the corridor and spent the night. On September 20, my uncle, who was in his seventies, came to help repair the roof. I didn’t know when it would be repaired. Someone from the village registered the loss of the house, but the old man didn&#39;t know how to subsidize it in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 20, the Suqian Emergency Management Bureau issued a WeChat article stating that it had insured urban and rural residents of Suqian City with public safety urban and rural assistance insurance, which would cover urban and rural housing in Suqian City due to floods and typhoons. Compensation for house losses caused by natural disasters such as landslides, landslides, fires and explosions. The compensation standard is that for urban housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 120,000 yuan/household; for rural housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 40,000 yuan/household. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The underwriter of this project is mainly the Suqian Branch of the People&#39;s Insurance Company of China Co., Ltd. Zheng Xinbo, the company&#39;s contact person, told Southern Weekend reporters that this private housing insurance is purchased by the government, and each household pays 2 yuan. , have been purchasing continuously for many years. After the disaster occurred, they sent more than 30 staff to the villages and towns on the 20th to verify the damage and determine the damage. The first batch of compensation will be completed before the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively speaking, Yancheng City has more experience in dealing with tornadoes. Public information shows that on June 23, 2012, Yancheng &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;>;City&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E9%98%9C%E5% AE%81/871643%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Funing&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text -decoration: none;&quot;>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E5%B0%84%E9%98%B3/871862%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Sheyang&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;An EF4 tornado occurred in some areas, with winds exceeding level 17. 99 people were killed and 846 injured. The local government built the Yancheng Memorial Hall for Fighting the &quot;6.23&quot; Tornado. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Funing County Party Committee Propaganda Department stated that Funing County has also formulated corresponding emergency plans for natural disasters that occur more frequently. After the tornado, the &quot;9.19&quot; Typhoon Emergency Rescue Command was established in the affected town as soon as possible; special teams were arranged to go to each disaster-stricken village to find out the situation, grasp the disaster situation as soon as possible and report it quickly. Four rounds of sifting search and rescue operations were carried out overnight on September 19. In addition, 129 disaster-stricken people were urgently relocated and resettled by staying with relatives and friends, staying in hotels, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiangsu is a tornado-prone area in the country. According to &quot;Jiangsu Meteorology&quot; news, from 1956 to 2015, a total of 109 tornadoes occurred in Jiangsu, with the highest proportion occurring in summer, reaching 79.8%, with an annual average of 1.5. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Jiangsu is prone to tornadoes is that the province has a flat terrain, dense rivers and lakes, and is located in the north-south climate transition zone. Cold and warm air currents frequently meet, which can easily form strong convective weather including tornadoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meteorological experts in the above article said that Jiangsu is usually less prone to tornadoes in mid-to-late September, but recently due to higher temperatures and the influence of the Jianghuai cyclone, relatively strong tornadoes have occurred. dynamic conditions. Against this background, a relatively rare tornado event occurred in Jiangsu on September 19. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 21st, Wang Xiaohua, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory, said in an interview with CCTV that the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory has built a strong convection and strong wind demonstration system from 2021 to 2023. , some preliminary forecast and warning capabilities of tornadoes. In the next step, the meteorological department will use multi-source observation data such as multi-band radar collaborative observation to improve and optimize tornado early warning technology and indicators based on the characteristics of climate change, and further improve forecast and early warning capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Local residents are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[白切鸡寿司走红，年轻人流行的“中餐日作”是真香吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257296]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:30:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[钱锺书回避鲁迅？No，他开启了“悄悄关注”模式]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257339]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B0asgnIe8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; height=&quot;487&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B 0asgnIe8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251595&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From left: Lin Yutang, Lu Xun, Soong Ching Ling, Smedley, Li Peihua (Secretary of Soong Ching Ling) ). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Qian Zhongshu rarely talked about Lu Xun publicly, he could not &quot;avoid&quot; Lu Xun. Crystal once said in &quot;Miscellaneous Notes of Shi Qian&#39;s Throwing Books&quot; that at a symposium, Qian Zhongshu praised Lu Xun&#39;s short stories for being well written, but not suitable for long stories. The most well-known person is Qian Zhongshu&#39;s opening speech at the &quot;Lu Xun and Chinese and Foreign Culture&quot; academic seminar. This article was later published in &quot;Literary Journal&quot; on October 23, 1986, and collected in &quot;The Edge of Life&quot;. In his opening speech, Qian Zhongshu said a few words &quot;as usual&quot; based on people&#39;s &quot;public opinion&quot; of Lu Xun at that time: &quot;Lu Xun was a great man. The greater the figure, the more aspects can be observed; &#39;Chinese and foreign culture&#39; is a big The bigger the topic, the wider the scope of the problems that can occur.&quot; The main spirit of his speech was to hope that everyone can &quot;speak freely without bending the meaning to seek consensus&quot;, and could not see the true evaluation of Lu Xun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Qian Zhongshu and Lu Xun also had a period of time in the same city. In September 1927, Lu Xun left Guangzhou and lived in Shanghai until his death in October 1936. Qian Zhongshu graduated from Tsinghua University in the summer of 1933 and taught at Guanghua University. He began studying at Oxford in the autumn of 1935, so he spent more than two years in Shanghai. However, they were only from the same city, and the two of them had never been seen crossing paths. However, as a later scholar and because of Lu Xun&#39;s huge influence, Qian Zhongshu inevitably had to &quot;encounter&quot; Lu Xun intentionally or unintentionally when writing. &quot;On the Parallel Study of Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu&quot; written by Liu Yukai and &quot;On the Comparative Study of Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu Literature&quot; written by Sui Qing&#39;e have all made comparisons from an academic level. Scholars such as Xie Yong, Wang Peijun, Li Guotao and Qian Zhijun have made comparisons in their writings. There are also elucidations from time to time, and I would like to unearth several examples related to Lu Xun from Qian Zhongshu&#39;s writings, which may fill the gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Besieged City&quot;, Sun Roujia&#39;s uncle and aunt hold important positions in a large cotton factory and have always looked down upon Fang Hongjian. Once, Fang Hongjian and Sun Roujia quarreled again over the arrival of his aunt. When he learned that his aunt wanted to find a position for him in the factory, he jumped up and shouted: &quot;Who wants her to find trouble for me? I can&#39;t even beg for food.&quot; Don&#39;t ask her for it! Isn&#39;t it enough that she has two lackeys, Bobby and you, Sun Roujia? You tell her that Fang Hongjian &#39;has no skills but a very bad temper&#39;, and you won&#39;t be a lackey of a capitalist lackey.&quot; This paragraph of text , immediately reminds people of Lu Xun&#39;s famous article &quot;&quot;Bereaved&quot; and &quot;The Capitalist&#39;s Lacking Lackey&quot; published in 1930, which criticized Liang Shiqiu. Although Qian Zhongshu was studying in Tsinghua University at the time, he would not have missed the articles on the Lu-Liang debate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 84 of the first volume of the Commercial Press&#39;s &quot;Notes of Rong&#39;an Pavilion&quot;, reading the notes of Yue Ke&#39;s &quot;History&quot;, Qian Zhongshu excerpted the following paragraph in Volume 12 and added a note:&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the summer of the 10th year of the reign of Emperor Xizong (Wanyan) of the Jin Dynasty, Long Jian (present) in the Yuzhai Palace, there was a heavy thunderstorm Arrive, break the pillar and go away. Everyone was shocked, thinking it was ominous, and wanted to look at it in disgust. Some people thought that a general amnesty should be granted, so they called Zhang Jun, a bachelor, to draft the imperial edict. Among them are the words &quot;Gu Zi is ignorant&quot; and &quot;Looking at Yu Xiaozi&quot;. The translator did not know the meaning of Tuo Qianchong, so he said: &quot;Han&#39;er is strong in knowledge, and he relies on words to criticize my Lord&#39;s ears.&quot; When asked why, he translated and explained its meaning: &quot;The widowed is lonely and has no relatives; the ignorant is ignorant of human affairs; the eyes are blind; the brat is a child.&quot; He was furious and summoned Jun to question him, but he failed to answer him. , slash (cut) its mouth with a hand sword, and dig it with thorns. I didn&#39;t know that it was translated as &quot;foolishness&quot; or &quot;treachery&quot;. So... According to this, Lu Xun is also the ancestor of literal translation. &quot; (&quot;Notes of Rong&#39;an Pavilion&quot; page 146)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jin Xizong Wanyan Dan was the third emperor of the Jin Dynasty. It is said that he studied under Han Fang before he came to the throne and was able to write poems in Chinese. After he came to the throne, he was particularly diligent in studying Chinese classics. According to this article in the &quot;History of the Emperor&quot;, Wanyan Quan did not seem to be very proficient in Chinese, and the translator could only &quot;literally translate&quot;, taking out of context the commonly used imperial edicts. Formulas such as &quot;Gu Zi is ignorant&quot; and &quot;Xiao Yu Xiaozi&quot; can be &quot;directly interpreted&quot; as cursing the Lord, thus losing the original meaning of &quot;retreating, trusting, and rushing&quot;, and Zhang Jun was convicted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Zhongshu&#39;s note &quot;This is the ancestor of Lu Xun&#39;s literal translation&quot; naturally reminds people of the &quot;Lu-Liang Controversy&quot;. In September 1929, Liang Shiqiu published &quot;On Mr. Lu Xun&#39;s Life&quot; in &quot;Crescent&quot; &quot;Hard Translation&quot;&quot;, Lu Xun refuted it by publishing &quot;&quot;Hard Translation&quot; and &quot;The Class Nature of Literature&quot;&quot; in &quot;Jinya Monthly&quot; in March of the following year. The debate has exceeded the boundaries of translation. As far as translation is concerned, Lu Xun advocated &quot;literal translation&quot; (or &quot;hard translation&quot;), such as the translation of &quot;The Symbol of Depression&quot;, which &quot;is translated sentence by sentence, or even word for word according to the rules&quot;, and its purpose is to &quot;prefer to believe rather than obey.&quot; Qian Zhongshu is obviously familiar with translation However, his views were different from those of Lu Xun, so Qian Zhongshu went on to write:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yu Reading &quot;Shuowen&quot; to the &quot;Kou&quot; part of the 26th word &quot;囮: 译也&quot;, Chang sighs Ji Chang (Editor&#39;s note: refers to Xu Shen), a true saint, foresees Tradutore, traditore! Wang Yuanzhi&#39;s &quot;Little Animals Collection&quot; Volume 14 &quot;Translation Dui&quot; says: &quot;Translation means Yi. It can change one&#39;s mind if it is big, but it can only change one&#39;s words if it is small. &quot;So on and so forth. After liberation, the trend of translating books became more and more popular. They did not know how to make mistakes, but they were eaten alive. Not only were they changed beyond recognition, but their hearts and minds were completely changed. They were the so-called &quot;great translators&quot; in Xun Yuan Dynasty. Gu Tangsheng&#39;s &quot;Records of Zhang Wenxiang&#39;s Shogunate&quot; Juan Xia said: &quot;Chen Lanbin envoy to the United States, one of his attendants, Xu, is not familiar with Western languages. One day, he suddenly picked up the Western Newspaper and seemed to be reading it with gusto. His colleagues asked him strangely. Xu said: I can&#39;t understand the Western Newspaper. I read Zhu Jun&#39;s translation. Also puzzled. If you still don&#39;t understand, it would be better to just read the Western newspaper. &quot;In this way, both this and Zhang Jun&#39;s incident can be used as the motto of today&#39;s translators. (ibid., pp. 146-147)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This note is related to the fact that &quot;after liberation&quot; the translation industry &quot;does not know what to do. Talking about &quot;eating alive&quot; is also a denial of &quot;literal translation&quot;. Regarding translation, what Qian Zhongshu pursues is the realm of &quot;translation&quot;, although &quot;thorough and complete &#39;translation&#39; is an unattainable ideal.&quot; Therefore, Qian Zhongshu pursues In the article, Zhongshu praised Xu Shen (Jianchang) as a &quot;true saint&quot; and said that he could predict that the translation would be &quot;囮&quot; (false) and that the translator (Tradutore) was a traitor (traditore). For details, see &quot;Lin Shu&#39;s Translation&quot; and There are several discussions in &quot;Guan Zhui Bian&quot;. The following part of this article is based on Gu Hongming&#39;s story of Xu reading a Western newspaper, and combined with Zhang Jun&#39;s view, he believes that &quot;all can be used as the motto of today&#39;s translators.&quot; It is humorous without losing irony, which is quite obvious. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s writing style is consistent. The most eye-catching part of the whole note is the note &quot;the ancestor of literal translation&quot; and so on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1920s and 1930s, Lin Yutang was trying to change the &quot;Chinese-style humor&quot; &quot;Joking attitude&quot; to reshape the virtues of gentlemen, so he advocated &quot;humorous literature&quot;. Unexpectedly, it backfired, as Qian Zhongshu criticized in his essay &quot;Joking&quot;: &quot;Since the promotion of humorous literature, joking has become a literati career. &quot;Lin Yutang helped the &quot;current ills&quot; by rescuing &quot;current ills.&quot; The actual effect of &quot;humorous literature&quot; ran counter to its original intention. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Jokes&quot; was inspired by &quot;humorous literature.&quot; As for Lin Yutang&#39;s ideas, Lu Xun In &quot;One Thought and Action&quot;, he once criticized: &quot;Boom, there is no shortage of humor and sketches in the world. &quot; (&quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&quot;, Volume 5, page 473) also pointed out in &quot;Explanation of &quot;Funny&quot;&quot; that humorous literature just gives &quot;slick, frivolous and obscene&quot; the &quot;title of &#39;humor&#39;&quot; (&quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&quot;) &quot;Volume 5, page 342). Some people therefore believe that &quot;Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu really echo each other in their views on promoting humorous literature&quot; (Li Qinye, &quot;Reading &amp;lt;Writing on the Edge of Life&quot;), This statement is specious.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of modern literature, Lu Xun, Lin Yutang and Qian Zhongshu are all famous for their humor. Lu Xun&#39;s humor is like a dagger, with the edge of a scalpel to remove tumors, while Lin Yutang&#39;s humor is The breeze is like a purifier for the soul. At that time, Lin Yutang&#39;s humorous literature was naturally not as powerful as Lu Xun&#39;s essays, so it seemed out of date and was publicly criticized by Lu Xun. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s humor was like cold rain hitting his face, cold and thorny, like a pretender The embarrassment and uneasiness after his soul was exposed. However, although Qian Zhongshu also criticized Lin Yutang, if you compare his &quot;Laughing&quot; with Lin Yutang&#39;s &quot;On Humor&quot;, you will find how similar their views on humor are: Qian Zhongshu It is said that a person who is really humorous will have a &quot;knowing smile&quot; about humor. Lin Yutang said that a calm and distant bystander will give a &quot;knowing smile&quot; to humor; Qian Zhongshu said that humor is &quot;funny and wise&quot; , Lin Yutang said, &quot;wisdom has begun&quot; and &quot;there is humor&quot;; Qian Zhongshu said that humor is &quot;a breath of breath for the dull life&quot;, Lin Yutang said that humor is &quot;a part of life&quot;. Humor originates from wisdom, famous humorists It is not surprising that Qian Zhongshu and Lin Yutang have similar concepts but different expressions and effects. Because of this view of humor, Lin Yutang advocates humorous literature to cultivate the people&#39;s sense of humor and cultivate educated citizens, while Qian Zhongshu believes that true humor can &quot; &quot;Anti-bowing and laughing at oneself&quot; will become a laughing stock once advocated, so he said: &quot;Humor is at most a kind of temperament and can never be labeled as an idea, let alone a profession.&quot; ” It can be seen that although Qian Zhongshu and Lu Xun both criticized the “humorous literature” advocated by Lin Yutang, it cannot be said that their views on humor are of the same origin. On the contrary, Qian Zhongshu and Lin Yutang’s views on humor are “similar to each other.”&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;As a witness and participant in the same literary and artistic trend, although Qian Zhongshu never had direct contact with Lu Xun, it even made people think that he sometimes deliberately &quot;looked sideways&quot; at Lu Xun, and followed the trend to find out the source. If we open the &quot;fog&quot;, we can still see their figures at the same time in major events in the history of modern literature, and then we can see Qian Zhongshu&#39;s consistent indifferent attitude towards Shi Xian, including Lu Xun, &quot;It&#39;s like seeing from flying sand, wheat waves, and ripples &quot;The posture of the wind&quot; (Qian Zhong&#39;s calligraphy). (The original title of this article was &quot;The posture of the wind&quot;, the current title was proposed by the editor)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“4.2千年事件”：地球大降温，华夏新生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257310]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At the beginning of this century, with the advancement of molecular biology, we were able to explore the origin of rice through gene testing - detection The results show that cultivated rice was first domesticated in the Yangtze River Basin about 13,500 to 8.2 thousand years ago, and then spread to Southeast Asia and South Asia. After hybridizing with wild indica rice in South Asia, cultivated indica rice was produced and returned to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the process of studying the origin of rice, genetic testing has brought questions. Scholars suddenly discovered that there are many strange things about its spread time: after rice was domesticated, it stayed in China for thousands of years and did not spread outside. However, around 4.2 to 4,000 years ago, almost at the same time, rice suddenly appeared on the Japanese Islands, the Korean Peninsula, the Philippines, Indo-China Peninsula and the South Asian subcontinent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This makes people wonder: What happened more than four thousand years ago? ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from ancient Chinese books, 4,000 years ago was around the time when the Xia Dynasty was established. It is said that after Emperor Yu controlled the floods, he sent envoys to measure &quot;the whole world&quot; and finally calculated that the distance from east to west and north to south of the earth was 233,500 miles and 75 steps. Although this is just a myth in the &quot;Book of Mountains and Seas&quot;, mythical stories often have prototypes: Maybe after Dayu established the Xia Dynasty, he sent envoys to explore the unknown world and spread rice to surrounding countries by the way? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, from an archaeological perspective, the world between 4.2 and 4,000 years ago was suffering unprecedented disasters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you pay attention to Chinese archeology, you may have heard the saying &quot;a sky full of stars&quot;, which describes ancient civilizations before the Xia Dynasty: China between 5000 and 4300 years ago was full of archaeological sites. There are Hongshan in the western Liao River basin and Longshan in the Yellow River basin. These two are already city-state civilizations; in the Yangtze River basin there are Liangzhu and Shijiahe, both of which have entered dynastic politics. At that time, the earth was in the famous &quot;Holocene Warm Period&quot;. The humid and warm climate allowed civilizations all over the world to thrive. Even the deserts of Central Asia and the Sahara Desert of Africa were livable places with widespread forests and lakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, by 4.2 to 4,000 years ago, the civilizations in the three major river basins all collapsed, and the entire land of China fell into chaos:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cities in Shijiahe and Liangzhu in the Yangtze River Basin collapsed one after another Destroyed and abandoned, the territory shrank sharply. By 3800 years ago, the original core area had almost become a no-man&#39;s land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many settlements in the Xiliao River Basin disappeared completely, and the population was directly replaced: genetic testing found that the Xiajiadian lower-class culture that later emerged in the local area had no genetic connection with the previous residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yellow River Basin is also full of victims: Archeology shows that the number of settlements in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River decreased by nearly 90% during this catastrophe, and the population may only be 1/10 of its original size. The exquisite and brilliant Longshan black pottery disappeared, and it was not until more than a hundred years later that a very rough gray pottery culture appeared - which means that the original civilization, the original knowledge and technology inheritance were also lost in this catastrophe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the origin of this catastrophe, the most common hypothesis is the Great Flood: Based on archaeological evidence, some scholars speculate that about 3920 years ago, a huge barrier lake formed in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, blocking the Yellow River. nearly 9 months. Afterwards, the barrier lake burst its banks, and about 16 billion cubic meters of lake water poured down instantly. The flood almost flattened the entire Yellow River Basin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this hypothesis has some truth, it cannot explain the great collapse that also occurred in the Yangtze River Basin during the same period - in fact, not only the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, but also the whole world experienced a great collapse of civilization at that time. This was obviously a Climate disasters affecting the world:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The forests and Saharan lakes in Central Asia disappeared, and the great desert was born; in the Nile River Basin of North Africa, the early dynasty that had flourished for five hundred years came to an abrupt end, severe drought led to the collapse of agriculture, and Egypt fell into The century-long famine and civil strife is known to history as the &quot;First Intermediate Period&quot;; in the two river basins of West Asia, the Akkadian Empire completed its unification for the first time. A large amount of farmland was abandoned and was immediately attacked by foreign barbarians; in Central and Northern Europe, The cooling made the climate cold and humid, leading to the great migration of many ethnic groups...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This climate catastrophe is now called the &quot;4.2 Millennium Event&quot;, a catastrophe that can be called the end of civilization. . The superposition of turbulent ocean currents, super volcanic eruptions and El Niño may be the culprits of this natural disaster. The 4.2 millennium event manifested itself differently in different regions. Some places experienced severe droughts, while others experienced floods, but generally speaking, major cooling occurred. In fact, this event occurred from the end of the &quot;Younger Dryas Little Ice Age&quot; until the end of the Little Ice Age. Today, humanity has experienced the most severe cooling. The temperature in many places has never returned to the level of the Holocene Warm Period, and the good days of comfort and warmth are gone forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, it was the 4.2 Thousand Years Incident that exterminated the ancestors of the Western Liao River, severely damaged the ancient city-states of the Yellow River, and destroyed the two ancient dynasties in the Yangtze River Basin. Agriculture collapsed, famine was rampant, and mourning was widespread. In just a few decades or even a few years, 90% of the population has been lost. This is a doomsday scene that we today cannot imagine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The few survivors in South China, namely the ancient farmers of the Yangtze River and their descendants, had to take their rice seeds with them and flee in search of new land that could barely be cultivated. They crossed the sea to the east and reached the Korean Peninsula and Japan, becoming the ancestors of Koreans and Japanese immigrants; they reached the Philippines to the south and became the first stop for the Austronesian people to conquer the Pacific; they crossed the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the west and reached the Indochina Peninsula and India. , and the local hunter indigenous people, merged to form the Mon-Khmer language family (South Asian language family)...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the saying goes, misfortunes and blessings depend on each other, and new life is also born in the doomsday disaster. After the catastrophe, China bid farewell to the &quot;starry sky&quot; and began to unite: the ancestors of South China (ancient Yangtze farmers) who fled famine, and another group arrived in the northern Central Plains. Here they met the ancient farmers of the Yellow River who had also fled here. The two integrated and communicated to build a new home together - the north and south areas of Songshan Mountain where Erlitou in Henan is located were not prominent during the Holocene warm period, with only some scattered small settlements. However, hundreds of years after the Great Collapse, probably ancestors who had fled from various places gathered here, and the place rapidly revived and grew. About 3,800 years ago, Erlitou had developed into the largest settlement in the entire Yellow River Basin and became the undisputed master of the Central Plains. It immediately began to expand aggressively, and soon became an unrivaled and powerful dynasty in the entire East Asia - many scholars believe that it is the Xia Dynasty in ancient books, and the era of unification of China has arrived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[凉山警方破获特大贩运毒品案，缴获各类毒品146千克、抓捕31人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257324]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the summer public security crackdown and rectification operations of public security agencies across the country, Liangshan Public Security focused on the characteristics of summer social security laws , focusing on prominent local illegal and criminal activities, using the &quot;Sharpening Sword&quot; operation as the starting point, strengthening crackdowns and rectification efforts, and implementing special work measures to effectively protect the peace of people&#39;s lives and maintain the overall stability of social security. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/5e015de2df5bfed8a0005a8fd8d1b0e2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;677&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/5e015de2df5bfed8a0005a8fd8d1b0e2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251585 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 20, the Liangshan Prefecture Public Security Bureau held a press briefing on the summer public security crackdown and the &quot;Strengthening the Sword&quot; operation, focusing on reporting on the results of the operation and typical cases.

In the screenings that lasted for 10 days, he was Gan Yaozu in &quot;Looking for Her&quot; and &quot;The Annual Party Can&#39;t Stop!&quot; &quot;Ma Jie&quot; and Pan Congcong in &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, whether he is the protagonist or supporting role, comedy or drama, he has appropriately expressed the character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Baike, becoming an actor was unexpected. On the eve of his graduation from college, he became famous for his dubbing work. In 2010, after graduating from Nanguang College of Communication University of China, he briefly worked in a television station, and then quickly went north to join the film and television company Wanhetianyi. When the company was on the verge of collapse and everyone was planning to go their separate ways, they filmed the short play &quot;Unexpectedly&quot;, which saved the company and made the director and actors an instant hit. The male protagonist of &quot;Unexpectedly&quot;, the narcissistic, self-deprecating, grassroots Wang Dachui, was played by Bai Gugu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of becoming popular in his early years was intertwined with the family teaching of &quot;live your own little life&quot;, and finally derived a happy-go-lucky character. He has his own comfort zone and feels good staying there. After work, I play football with my friends, watch football, read comics and TV shows, and spend time with my parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only time he experienced stepping out of his comfort zone since he was a child was when he decided to apply for the broadcasting major because he liked football and wanted to be a football commentator. After studying media for four years, although he failed to become a commentator, he became sensitive to the matter of &quot;recording&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also related to this that Baike liked the script of &quot;Looking for Her&quot;, a female self-awareness exploration in a traditional village. He said: &quot;This kind of thing is very meaningful to me. I think the topic needs to be recorded.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because he had to memorize Cantonese lines and play opposite Shu Qi, the filming of &quot;Looking for Her&quot; was not easy for Baike. There was a scene where he and Shu Qi quarreled, and there was a lot of Cantonese dialogue, which was originally going to be filmed after the actors got used to each other. However, the crew encountered a typhoon as soon as they arrived in Huizhou, the filming location. In order to avoid the bad weather, director Chen Shizhong planned to shoot the quarrel scene indoors first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He would not say that I was scared before the shooting, nor would he say that I would definitely be able to do it, and then he would complete it very well. He is very relaxed, but has strong energy inside.&quot; Later Chen Shizhong said Then I realized that Bai Ke was nervous, but he hid it. Chen Shizhong had seen a journalist role he played, and on the day after watching it, he posted on WeChat Moments: Bai Ke can give the director a great sense of security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He is an actor like water.

It first premiered on August 4 with 4 episodes, and then stopped airing the next day due to &quot;media reasons&quot;, setting a record for the &quot;fastest offline&quot; of a domestic drama. It did not resume broadcast until September 6, dispelling the audience&#39;s doubts that it disappeared out of thin air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/5a25a4a369827783352e693c7158d38e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/5a25a4a369827783352e693c7158d38e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251571&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Stranger&quot; &quot;Under&quot; is adapted from the well-known Chinese comic &quot;Under One Person&quot; created by Mi Er. The original work is not only well-received but also extremely popular. Since the animated version came out in 2016, it has been broadcast for a total of five seasons, with an average score of 8.4 on Douban. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;qi (qi) warrior&quot; in traditional fairy tale novels was fictionalized by Mi Er into a &quot;stranger&quot; hidden in the real world in the original work. &quot;Extraordinary people&quot; are gifted with special abilities and can skillfully control their own &quot;qi&quot;, thus possessing special abilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that during the Jiashen period (1944), several strangers discovered the &quot;Eight Wonderful Skills&quot; such as the Origin of Qi Ti, Ju Ling Qian Jiang, Fenghou Qimen, and the Tongtian Rui, which caused the strangers to People in the world fought for it, which triggered a bloody storm, known in history as the &quot;Jiashen Rebellion.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/0c12eb18e51067c31c3f414d93f0f34f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; height= &quot;270&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/0c12eb18e51067c31c3f414d93f0f34f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251573&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The comic is adapted into Dramas have a natural barrier, which is mainly reflected in the degree of casting and adaptation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the live-action version of &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Under the Stranger&quot; also experienced a difficult casting controversy when it first aired. Zhang Chulan, played by Peng Yuchang, was questioned for her poor appearance and lacked the ruffian spirit in the original work; Feng Baobao, played by Wang Yinglu, was questioned for her dull acting skills, like a humanoid AI; Zhang Lingyu, played by Bi Wenjun, had inconsistent appearance and temperament , was criticized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/3e397c0a9ab9647b08e98a436e959af9.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;736&quot; height= &quot;308&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/3e397c0a9ab9647b08e98a436e959af9.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251570&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although these doubts It&#39;s not unreasonable, but it&#39;s also common for people to have difficulty in choosing the right characters for comic book adaptations. Since the audience watches the original work first, they are bound to have preconceptions and view the comic-adapted drama with resistance. When the domestic comic drama &quot;Soul of Chess&quot; came out, it was labeled as &quot;ruining childhood&quot; due to casting and styling issues. It was not until the story got better in the later years that the reputation changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/36a6d71ccad0a47b673eee745a80a5f7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;450&quot; ​​data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/36a6d71ccad0a47b673eee745a80a5f7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251572&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, select Whether the corner sticks to the face or not is very important, but one move will not determine life or death. Because there is still a plot, and a good storyline can also turn the tide. And this involves the &quot;degree&quot; of adaptation: too few adaptations, and it is suspected of copying and pasting; too many adaptations, and the characters and famous scenes are not restored enough, and it is easy to fall into the misunderstanding of &quot;magic modification&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the comic drama &quot;Under the Stranger&quot;, the male protagonist Zhang Chulan accidentally got involved in the world of strangers because his grandfather Zhang Huaiyi&#39;s bones were stolen. In the process of searching for his grandfather&#39;s body, he first met Feng Baobao, a girl who behaved strangely, and then was recruited by the mysterious organization Nadu Tong. He passed the trial of the Tianshi Mansion in Longhu Mountain and got the opportunity to participate in the Alien Martial Arts Competition. Opportunity...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the descendant of the &quot;Eight Skills&quot; Qi Ti lineage, Zhang Chulan quickly became a popular star in the alien world, attracting the attention of all forces. In the process of wrestling with various forces, he gradually came to face the various alien abilities that his grandfather had taught him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e74900efbaca076c702130cdaa78d40b.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;727&quot; height= &quot;311&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e74900efbaca076c702130cdaa78d40b.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251574&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Original author Mi Secondly, &quot;Under the Stranger&quot; has restored the rich world view constructed with imaginative settings to a greater extent, including various sects, families and stunts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disguised as a logistics company, &quot;Everywhere Connect&quot; has employees who are all composed of aliens. They are responsible for maintaining the balance and stability of the alien world and ensuring that ordinary people will not be aware of the existence of aliens. It is a bit like a cartoon. S.H.I.E.L.D. in the Marvel Universe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the alien world, the ten men with the highest say are from the Tianshi Mansion, the Lu Family, the Lu Family, the Tianxiahui, the Wang Family, the Mu Family, and the Chen Family. Zhang Zhiwei, the Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain, is the leader of the ten men. He has a very high level of cultivation and is over a hundred years old.

It was founded by Yang Zhu, one of the hundreds of scholars in the Warring States period. It originally emphasized &quot;preserving integrity and not burdening the body with things&quot;. Unfortunately, it gradually went astray in the later period and became an evil spirit in the alien world. group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the number of episodes currently aired, the overall quality of &quot;Under the Strangers&quot; is still good. First of all, director Xu Hongyu set a clear main line for the whole play, changing the unit-style narrative habit of the original work, using the male protagonist Zhang Chulan as the entry point, allowing him to lead the audience into the world of strangers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, as the plot progresses, several suspense points in the original work become clear and intriguing, such as the reasons for the &quot;Jiashen Rebellion&quot; and the mystery of Feng Baobao&#39;s life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, in addition to restoring the characters and famous scenes, the main creator also showed good subjective initiative, such as rationalizing the popular character Wang Ye in advance. Under the interpretation of actor Hou Minghao, this The charm of the character continues in the play. Many viewers said that they came for the comic adaptation and eventually became fans of Wang Ye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the entire plot is dense and fast-paced. The plot has advanced to the 20th episode, and the content of the first two seasons and extra chapters of the animated version has been completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e1f0d2c3443b5dc9a4c30ec286e96262.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;455&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e1f0d2c3443b5dc9a4c30ec286e96262.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251577&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the core idea It seems that &quot;Under the Stranger&quot; has firmly captured the essence of the original work, that is, &quot;What is a Stranger?&quot; Mi Er once mentioned in an interview that this story began with the word &quot;foreigner&quot;. He wanted to express the theme of &quot;if one day you find that you are different from others, how should you deal with yourself and how should you get along with the world?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone will encounter such torture when growing up. Some people choose to stick to themselves, while others choose to blend in with others. There is no right or wrong way to do this. No matter what choice you make, the ultimate goal is to find your own place in this world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/cba1cf717be21996e7db64fffed47ee5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;789&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/cba1cf717be21996e7db64fffed47ee5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251576&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Stranger &quot;The word itself has two meanings, one is a person with special powers, and the other is a rejected alien. The male protagonist Zhang Chulan happens to possess these two characteristics. But what he yearned for wholeheartedly was to be an ordinary person and live an ordinary life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, he endured it for 12 years, in order not to expose his strength and to survive. But the tree wanted to be still but the wind didn&#39;t stop. The more he wanted to be calm, the more he couldn&#39;t be calm. When things finally came to a head, he gave up his patience and began to explore the truth about the alien world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e75c9fa1134fb62283f569f81e90c661.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;597&quot; height= &quot;248&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e75c9fa1134fb62283f569f81e90c661.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;251578&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you say before In 22 years, being a stranger but being willing to be ordinary is a kind of strength. After that, it is another kind of strength to face one&#39;s own abilities and choose to live a life with dignity and confidence. What the play emphasizes is not &quot;strangers&quot;, but &quot;people&quot; - people&#39;s choices, people&#39;s confrontation with fate, and people&#39;s pursuit of the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, this is not an impeccable drama. If you are repulsive to the &quot;secondary sense&quot; itself, you will probably accept incompetence. But if you like this style and the passion of teenagers, then it will most likely provide you with happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[李硕：直面历史深渊，再现惊心动魄的华夏新生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256821]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;The book &quot;Jian Shang&quot; has caused waves in the circles of archeology, history and literature and history enthusiasts, making the author Li Shuo the best performer in 2023 The most dazzling academic newcomer.

He said that because there were no groups in his circle of friends, he sent a message to inform his friends: If you have any debts, please contact him. As for other messages, he will not reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person who has been looking forward to meeting each other for months may suddenly never have the chance to meet again. For the next week, I was in a state of trance, savoring the extremely plain words of the Japanese tea ceremony - &quot;One period, one moment, should be cherished in this life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shuo&#39;s &quot;last words of life and death&quot; were screenshotted and forwarded by good people, and added The media followed up, and public attention surged. This also made his new work &quot;Jian Shang&quot; unexpectedly &quot;break the circle&quot; and sold out within a few days. For a time, &quot;Jian Shang&quot; and several past books by Li Shuo were marked with the word &quot;pre-sale&quot; on major book websites. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A wonderful book of genius&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since the beginning of 2023, Li Shuo has been listed as a scholar of our focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if there was no last words incident that attracted public attention, the book &quot;Jian Shang&quot; was enough to make Li Shuo the most outstanding academic rookie in 2023. Since its publication at the end of 2022, the book has caused waves in the circles of archeology, history and literature and history enthusiasts. According to data provided by the publisher, the print run had reached 100,000 copies by the end of February. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Hong, the former captain of the Erlitou archaeological team and archaeologist, used &quot;shock&quot; to describe his feelings after reading the manuscript. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a strange book with a bloody atmosphere, in which Li Shuo reveals a dark past in the early days of Chinese civilization. After examining the archaeological excavation results from the end of the Neolithic Age to the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, he found that: during the Yin and Shang Dynasties, there was a nationwide, large-scale, and normalized phenomenon of human blood sacrifice, and various methods of cruelty and sacrifice were very mature; But starting from the Zhou Dynasty, this phenomenon suddenly almost completely disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analyzing the oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions of this period and re-interpreting the &quot;Book of Changes&quot;, Li Shuo believed that the disappearance of human sacrifice was directly related to the Zhou Dynasty&#39;s destruction of the Shang Dynasty. After King Wu destroyed the merchants and died of illness, Zhou Gongdan, who was assisting the government, banned the merchants&#39; custom of human sacrifice, almost completely erasing the records and historical memories of blood sacrifices, and replaced them with &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;the concept of destiny&quot; centered on etiquette and music. ”, thus recreating a new Chinese civilization characterized by peace and tolerance, which continues to this day. Since then, the history of human sacrifice has been blank in the Central Plains for more than three thousand years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The insight and understanding of the &quot;Shang and Zhou Dynasties&quot; began with Wang Guowei in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. In &quot;On the Institutions of the Yin and Zhou Dynasties&quot;, he put forward the view that &quot;the changes in Chinese politics and culture did not occur during the Yin and Zhou Dynasties&quot;, and from the perspective of his eldest son ( ;&quot;>;This paper discusses the differences between the Yin and Zhou Dynasties in three aspects: the patriarchal system, mourning clothes, enfeoffment, etc.&lt;/span>;), the number of temples, and the non-marriage of the same surname, which opened the prelude to the study of the &quot;Shang and Zhou Dynasties&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Jian Shang&quot; is a further development of Mr. Jing&#39;an&#39;s views. Li Shuo focuses on &quot;blood sacrifice of human animals&quot; to explain why the theocracy of merchants was so drastically transformed into the secular moral-political system of the Zhou Dynasty centered on &quot;morality&quot; during the Shang and Zhou Dynasties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shuo, who has always been a talented writer, also showed his outstanding writing talent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to calmly and calmly restoring the large-scale killings at human sacrifice sites during archaeological excavations, he also carved out dramatic story lines in the Shang and Zhou Dynasties - for example, the Zhou people hunted for the Shang king The &quot;black history&quot; of human sacrifice, the love and marriage between Boyikao, the eldest son of King Wen, and Yijiang, the daughter of Jiang Taigong, the dark memories and pain caused by the blood sacrifice to King Wen&#39;s family, and the care King Wen took with tortoise bones in the dark cellar Deducing and plotting the great cause of destroying business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &quot;Jian Shang&quot; re-understood and reshaped King Wen of Zhou, King Wu of Zhou, Gongdan of Zhou and others. In particular, Zhou Gongdan, the seemingly broad-minded &quot;moral incarnation&quot; in the Confucian classics, presents a rich and complex appearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shuo wrote &quot;The Great History of Confucius&quot; in his early years. He connected the two Confucian saints who were five hundred years apart and speculated that Confucius may have discovered the bloody history that Duke Zhou deliberately erased and the The intention behind it. This explains quite convincingly why a scholar from the Spring and Autumn Period paid homage to the Duke of Zhou, as well as the sadness and heaviness that he felt in his old age: &quot;I no longer dream of seeing the Duke of Zhou.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQOWYvUQtlpFaN27HtwaRxiP225au4c8TbRLnN0J.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQOWYvUQtlpFaN27HtwaRxiP225au4c8TbRLnN0J.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250537&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Shuo at the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, Pakistan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;Puzzle game super player&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first time I learned the name Li Shuo was 10 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2012, an article of tens of thousands of words, &quot;Zhou&#39;s Destruction of Shang and the Rebirth of Chinese Civilization,&quot; has been circulating in the online community of literature and history enthusiasts. The author is Li Shuo. Its novel and unique viewpoints, strange imagination, and vivid narrative have left an unforgettable impression on many people. The article has also become a long-lasting hot topic in the literary and historical circles. Because it was too strange and strange, I regarded it more as an imaginative &quot;historical possibility novel&quot;, similar to &quot;The History of the Mayan Conquest of the Yin Shang Fleet&quot; by the best-selling author Ma Boyong in his early years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following more than ten years, Li Shuo continued his exploration, thoroughly delved into the professional fields of Neolithic Age and Xia and Shang archaeology, visited archaeological sites, and reinterpreted the &quot;Book of Changes&quot;, and finally wrote this inspiring article He Chuangjian&#39;s &quot;wonderful articles&quot; have developed into a work of nearly 500,000 words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Jian Shang&quot; has not only been highly praised and recommended by academic authorities, but also caused considerable controversy in the field of classics and history - mainly questioning Li Shuo&#39;s logic and arguments in constructing the entire book. Excessive use of reasoning and imagination is the so-called &quot;too much imagination&quot;. Some conservative academics even believe that &quot;Jian Shang&quot; should not be classified as a serious academic work, but more like a wonderful novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This reminds one of what a famous Qin and Han historian said: It is a blessing that less than 10% of historical records have survived. In the ancient times when civilization itself was still in its infancy, historical reconstruction relied almost entirely on sporadic archaeological excavation results, leaving a huge blank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the leaders of all spirits, we are so eager to understand our ancestors and past. When faced with the reality of a long history, lack of records, and limited cultural relics that make it difficult to form a complete and convincing narrative, how should we find and restore our past? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shuo provides a new research and writing method full of personal color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Jian Shang&quot;, he is like a super player playing jigsaw puzzles: with extremely talented imagination, powerful analysis and reasoning, based on fragmented archaeological information, sporadic Ancient documents, reasoning, imagination, and connections provide us with a possible overall picture of the early days of Chinese civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is no exaggeration to say that for the formation and transformation of early Chinese civilization, Li Shuo came up with a complete and logically consistent explanation model that is currently the most convincing. As archaeologist Xu Hong pointed out: Li Shuo&#39;s research and writing are certainly not &quot;perfect&quot;; but in comparison, many current studies of ancient times are mediocre works of little value and significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the interview, many young scholars agreed on one point: &quot;Jian Shang&quot; is a true milestone in the research and writing of ancient history. If there are more archaeological discoveries and research in the future, many of his inferences and imaginations will be tested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Whether it is confirmation, supplement, or partial falsification, it is very valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/09/13/iBkO5ZxbWsP0L4wnSODOV8lMvFDYULlf5ApSlkLR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/13/iBkO5ZxbWsP0L4wnSODOV8lMvFDYULlf5ApSlkLR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250542&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Born to Death&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Li Shuo and I met in January 2023, for The book &quot;Jian Shang&quot; made an interview with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That winter, Li Shuo was collecting and conducting research in Pakistan. The signal on the road was sometimes good or bad. I suggested that we meet and chat after he returns to China: in addition to communication issues, the main reason is because I have a lot of things I want to communicate with him outside of &quot;Jian Shang&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more I learn about Li Shuo and his writings, the more curious I become: a young scholar who was originally from a mainstream elite and possesses talents can definitely have a more comfortable and leisurely life, and it is easier to achieve success and fame. , why did he choose such a marginal, difficult, and dangerous path? He also laughed at himself as a &quot;homeless scoundrel&quot; who wandered around all year round. He was forty years old, had no house, no car, no money, and was sometimes burdened with making ends meet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shuo was born in 1977. He studied in the liberal arts experimental class of Peking University for his undergraduate degree. He worked as a reporter for several years and later entered the History Department of Tsinghua University to study for a master&#39;s and doctoral degree. When he graduated with a doctorate, he had every chance of getting a teaching position in a university in a major mainland city, but he went to a border area to find a job. In his spare time, he travels to the Himalayas and South Asia all year round, which are geopolitically sensitive areas where ethnic, religious and military conflicts occur frequently. During the trip, he was questioned and &quot;clinged&quot; by the local military and police as a suspicious person, but he also made some interesting new friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Spring Festival of 2023, a crisis broke out in Pakistan and the situation suddenly became tense. Friends were all worried about his safety on the road. Every day, he recorded his &quot;awkward&quot; encounters with the military and police along the way, and talked and laughed with them without taking it seriously, until he suddenly lost contact and disappeared for more than ten days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I had a very bad premonition at the time, thinking that his life was in danger.&quot; One of his friends recalled - later I learned that Li Shuo suddenly fell ill and fell into a coma on the road. After being rescued locally, Was rushed back to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shiping, a young scholar who has a close relationship with him, said: Li Shuo is not a simple adventurer. The reason why he travels in seemingly unstable areas all year round is out of his interest in the historical Silk Road and the history of the Silk Road. Interests and passions in a multicultural and ethnic intersection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In fact, his research and writing path has inherited the historical writing tradition of the East and the West since ancient times. Whether it is Herodotus, the &#39;father of history&#39; in the West, or Sima Qian in China, In ancient times when transportation was inconvenient and travel was full of dangers, they traveled around and conducted field surveys.&quot; &quot;Today, when transportation and communication are so convenient, many historical researchers and writers have abandoned this tradition.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shuo has a wild heart and great feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than ten years, he has been walking, thinking and writing with his life. In the few years when he was writing &quot;Jian Shang&quot;, Li Shuo fell into a state of depression because he faced that extremely bloody and violent dark history for a long time. His friend and travel writer Suishui believed that this was probably the main factor that caused him to suffer from the dangerous disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is an extraordinary year for Li Shuo. In this personal disaster, his calmness and indifference in the face of life and death made many people who knew him or did not know him respect him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a brush with death, his physical and mental state improved significantly after the operation. He is currently receiving treatment while starting to write a new book that he has been preparing for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
