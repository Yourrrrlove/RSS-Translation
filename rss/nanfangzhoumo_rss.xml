She is still in the intensive care unit. The owner of the ferocious dog Criminal enforcement measures have been taken. This incident brought the existential conflict between humans and dogs to the focus of social attention, and triggered widespread discussions: how to defend yourself when vicious dogs attack, what legal basis are there for pets to hurt people, and how to raise dogs in a civilized manner... &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; Several attorneys and canine behavior experts were interviewed about these hot topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Private or sue? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;One late night in February 2021, He Qing (pseudonym), who lives in Chaoyang District, Beijing, was walking his dog in the community when he was suddenly attacked by an unleashed German Shepherd (commonly known as the &quot;black dog&quot;). &quot;back&quot;) fell to the ground. Hei Bei bit He Qing&#39;s left cheek, tearing a hole and causing blood to flow out. At this time, the owner of Heibei arrived in a hurry and immediately sent her to the hospital with He Qing&#39;s husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the break between treatments, He Qing’s husband asked the owner of the black back to write a handwritten statement of the situation, explaining the time, place and process of the incident, and attaching a signature. This written record became the key to subsequent legal proceedings. evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the black-backed owner admitted the fact at the first time, she later regretted it, denying the fact that her dog bit He Qing, and claimed that He Qing was bitten by her dog (Bichon Frize). ) bitten and refused to pay any expenses including medical expenses. Helpless and angry, He Qing decided to use the law to protect her legitimate rights and interests, filed a lawsuit with Beijing Chaoyang Court, and hired lawyer Wang Yandong from Beijing Lianggao Law Firm as her attorney. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Wang obtained key video records such as community and hospital surveillance as evidence, and submitted them to the court together with the defendant&#39;s handwritten description of the situation and other evidence. In the end, the court ruled that the plaintiff He Qing won the case, and the defendant had to pay the plaintiff a total of more than 15,000 yuan, including medical expenses, transportation expenses, nutrition expenses, and mental damage solatium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Wang specifically mentioned the 5,000 yuan moral comfort payment, &quot;The amount of compensation in this type of infringement cases is usually not very high, but if the infringing party does not recognize the liability or has a very bad attitude, it will cause The victim suffered psychological trauma. I specifically added a claim for emotional consolation to the lawsuit, because my client is a woman, and the injury was to such an important part of the face, which required suturing and long-term surgery. The process of repair and plastic surgery, and the psychological impact of this trauma on a woman cannot be ignored. In the end, the court supported our petition, and this mental comfort payment brought great psychological comfort to my client.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/FxiNfrPjgMQuTgQP3r9vteVtryDT34HY4Zwxxa2q.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/FxiNfrPjgMQuTgQP3r9vteVtryDT34HY4Zwxxa2q.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254740&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Nantong, Jiangsu Province, the police distributed promotional materials to encourage the public to raise dogs in a scientific and civilized manner&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;One and a half years after the incident, He Qing obtained the court judgment in August 2022 and received corresponding compensation. There are still scars on her face. She and the defendant ignored each other when they met in the community. Since the black back raised by the defendant is a prohibited dog in the &quot;Beijing Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot;, it was sent away after the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Lawyer Wang, in reality, not many people like He Qing end up in the litigation process because raising animals causes damage to the parties. “If the other party does not regret it midway, but actively apologizes, Negotiating compensation will most likely not lead to litigation. This is because the economic and time costs of going through judicial procedures are relatively high. Many parties drop out or stop litigation because they are tired of litigating.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When encountering such incidents , should the two parties resolve it through negotiation or resort to public power for judgment? Lawyer Du Jiahong, a partner at Beijing Xinglai Law Firm, believes that when criminal liability is not involved, it mainly depends on whether the two parties have reached an agreement on the understanding of the infringement (including the cause of the infringement and the damage results) and the handling results. &quot;It causes a tenth-level disability, but if the offending party has a good attitude and actively compensates, the two parties may reach an agreement. However, if they cannot reach an agreement for several thousand yuan, they may also file a lawsuit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Wang suggested When such infringement occurs, evidence must be obtained as soon as possible and the evidence must be fixed first. &quot;When the infringement first occurs, the resistance and alertness of the relevant party may not be very strong. Regarding some facts, he may admit that this The infringed party must fix the evidence for later use in defending rights. The focus of filing a lawsuit in court to defend rights is the evidence. If the evidence is not fully fixed in the early stage, once the infringer retorts or does not admit the facts later, it will be This causes greater difficulties in safeguarding rights. There are many ways to obtain evidence, such as video, recording, signing a written agreement recognized by both parties, etc. When necessary, relevant surveillance can be obtained through the public security organs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/hYIaK5IAlfTdL03KKUiscAchU02wgNux3iprwdDw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/hYIaK5IAlfTdL03KKUiscAchU02wgNux3iprwdDw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254736&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A golden retriever is undergoing a scare test - screening out dogs prone to excessive fear, aggression or over-excitability of running, screaming, over-enthusiastic people. This test simulates the scenarios that therapy dogs may encounter in service facilities, minimizing safety hazards&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A dog bites a person&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;it is essentially a tort&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At present, our country’s laws regarding animal-related injuries To deal with harm, we mainly refer to Chapter 9 &quot;Liability for harm caused by raising animals&quot; in the Tort Liability Section of the Civil Code. Articles 1,245 to 1,247 of this article clarify the liability for harm caused by raising animals. General regulations, liability for damage caused by failure to take safety measures for animals in violation of regulations, and liability for damage caused by dangerous animals that are prohibited from being raised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“A dog bites a person essentially because of the inappropriate behavior of the animal’s breeder or manager (not tying the leash, not closing the door, etc.), causing damage to other people’s rights to life, health, and body rights. Such illegal behavior should bear corresponding liability for compensation. However, if it can be proved that the damage was caused intentionally by the infringed party, its liability can be reduced,&quot; said Lawyer Wang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to lawyer Du, according to data provided by the China Judgments Network, three years since the official implementation of the Civil Code on January 1, 2021, only 100,000 judgments have been made nationwide on animal damage liability disputes. &quot;This data may not be completely accurate, but the number of such cases nationwide in three years is in the order of thousands, which shows that the number of cases is relatively small. What is this concept? Taking the Beijing area as an example, according to China According to the Judgment Documents Network, there have been more than 30,000 marriage and family dispute cases in the past three years,&quot; said lawyer Du. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this does not mean that the probability of such incidents happening in reality is small. &quot;(It&#39;s just that) most of them will be resolved through negotiation or mediation.&quot; Attorney Du shared a mediation case she has handled. In a community in Beijing, a mother and daughter were playing on the lawn. The mother turned her back to answer the phone. When the daughter saw a puppy not far away, she broke away from her mother&#39;s hand and wanted to see the dog. As soon as the mother let go and before the girl took a step, the puppy rushed towards the girl and scratched her right arm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The examination fees, medical fees, vaccination fees, nutrition fees, transportation fees, etc. incurred by medical treatment total about 4,000 yuan. The dog owner did not want to pay compensation. He believed that the main cause of the injury was the failure of parents to take good care of their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the dispute occurred, Lawyer Du intervened in the relevant mediation. &quot;I would like to tell the dog owner, first of all, you did not put a leash on the dog and lead it, which is a violation of the Beijing Dog Breeding Management Regulations. Unless the offended person was intentional, he should bear full responsibility. Secondly, the little girl was not separated from her mother at the time. The scope of care was that the little girl was suddenly jumped three or four meters away from the dog. The little girl was not exposed to a dangerous environment due to her own reasons, but was harmed due to the dog&#39;s pounce behavior in a relatively safe state. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/GqQFhDEKTz7b1rnqn5pxiC9tixWO2rqxvUrqSIaa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/GqQFhDEKTz7b1rnqn5pxiC9tixWO2rqxvUrqSIaa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254735&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beijing, citizens holding dogs walking in the rain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In the end, the dog owner fully compensated the medical expenses and also paid the mother’s lost work wages. After the incident, the girl was frightened and did not go to school for a week, and her mother accompanied her all day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to lawyer Du’s recollection, the incident took place in a high-end community, and the two parties finally negotiated the amount of compensation in a friendly atmosphere. “These few thousand yuan may not be very large in the eyes of the parties involved. The number, but this mother hopes to establish a correct value for her children - what is right and what is wrong, one day you bully others, you have to compensate. When you are bullied, you must take up the weapon of justice, the law. At the same time, she also Teach children not to actively provoke animals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Du also mediated an animal injury dispute that had entered into litigation. A medium-sized dog without a leash bit a small dog that was on a leash while walking. Because the owner of the small dog kicked the medium-sized dog while protecting his own dog, he was also scratched. The infringed party filed a claim of nearly 10,000 yuan. Finally, through the mediation of lawyer Du, the two parties reconciled, and the infringing party compensated several thousand yuan, most of which was used for the medical care of small dogs. &quot;For this type of tort liability incident, the losses caused to people and property fall within the scope of rights protection. Therefore, it is not just dog bites that require compensation, but also dog bites.&quot; Lawyer Du analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/RlFJGgpVB32COdu2c1JWfWyZvxXIbVVF871eKyvY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/RlFJGgpVB32COdu2c1JWfWyZvxXIbVVF871eKyvY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254738&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangzhou, Guangdong, citizens walking their dogs encountered a robot dog&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Zheng Jie/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Humans and pets coexist harmoniously&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to avoid being attacked by dogs? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Qi, a canine behavior expert and senior pet trainer, divides people&#39;s defense against dogs into two situations: one is when walking normally and seeing loose dogs, pedestrians should try to avoid interacting with dogs. Look at each other, keep walking normally (don’t tiptoe, don’t shout loudly, etc.), don’t approach or drive it away, and avoid irritating it; if we encounter the situation where a girl in Chongzhou is actively attacked by a dog, we should use the effective tools around us in time - Use bricks, wooden sticks, umbrellas, etc. to drive away dogs. Wu Qi watched the live video circulated on the Internet, and he pointed out that the mop in the cleaning lady&#39;s hand played a key role in driving away the attacking black Rottweiler. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wu Qi, there are some emergency treatment methods when encountering a dog attack, such as quickly taking off your clothes, wrapping them in one of your hands, and using this hand to block the attraction. Dog attacks, this can maximize the protection of important parts such as the neck and head. If a man with certain strength is attacked, you can try to use a leash to strangle the dog&#39;s neck to make it feel suffocated and loosen its mouth, or use your fingers to dig its eyes to temporarily lose its ability to attack. &quot;In an emergency like this, the focus must be on human life safety. We drive the dogs away within a reasonable range, but we should not be overly defensive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to prevent such an incident from happening again? Obviously not everyone can solve this problem by just carrying a stick around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/T9RgDrhnPcaH1n0vRvboqP9lTulrw4JYrt5rP4IO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/T9RgDrhnPcaH1n0vRvboqP9lTulrw4JYrt5rP4IO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254739&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hangzhou, Zhejiang, citizens queue up to apply for certificates with their pets at the dog approval window&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Wu Qi himself has more than 30 years of experience in raising dogs and has been engaged in pet training for 17 years. He said that the vicious dog injury incident in Chongzhou was &quot;a murder caused by a dog, which caused anxiety among parents with children. Dog parents are also anxious, and it has even turned into a confrontation between dog owners and non-dog owners.” Wu Qi believes that understanding between groups should be enhanced and barriers eliminated. “First of all, we must know that this is not a dog problem, but a problem of individual uncivilized dog owners. As pet owners, while we enjoy the right to keep pets, we must try not to infringe on them. Others - In addition to keeping the dog leash in accordance with regulations and cleaning up pet excrement in a timely manner, if you take your dog in an elevator and encounter a lot of people or people who are obviously afraid of dogs, you should take the initiative to avoid it and wait for the next one; when walking your dog Keep a distance from the elderly and children, and keep the dog calm... In addition, we need to know more about our dog and take it to do some necessary obedience and socialization training. We must invest time and energy and take it to the suburbs to be pet-friendly. Run in the park green space to release their energy. Daily walks and socialization should also allow them to gradually transition from an environment with relatively low pressure to an environment with many people and high pressure.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In Wu Qi&#39;s view, keeping pets is a way of life for modern people. It can liberate people from stressful work conditions, add a living atmosphere to the family, and is also a manifestation of love for life. People who don’t own pets should be understanding. Pet owners must learn correct and scientific pet-raising concepts and management methods. People who do not keep pets but like small animals must also learn the correct way to interact with small animals. They must obtain the owner&#39;s consent before touching pets and understand the preferences of pets. , Are there any places that are sensitive and inappropriate to touch? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/qyKoggwme4hCUczK1wXYBRIq6jYbtCfgebgLo62R.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/qyKoggwme4hCUczK1wXYBRIq6jYbtCfgebgLo62R.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254737&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dogs and owners waiting to be evaluated as therapy dogs.

For example, the elderly with dementia, autistic children, physically disabled people, patients with depression, and youth groups on campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Therapy Dog has been established for more than ten years and has served more than 100,000 people in more than ten cities across the country. So far, there has not been a single incident of a dog hurting anyone. In addition to therapy dogs, there are also guide dogs, etc. &quot;Other working dogs are silently helping humans.&quot; Wu Qi regards creating a harmonious social environment with pets as the key to resolving conflicts. &quot;Including these dogs in the family, their companionship brings indescribable happiness and joy to people.&quot; Comfort.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人类的智商正在逐年下降？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258947]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In 1978, in order to write a book to refute the so-called &quot;white people are superior to other races&quot;, American scholar James Flynn The study of human IQ began. His original plan was to just flip through the information and quote a few pages from the book. However, after reviewing a large amount of literature, Flynn was surprised to notice that Americans&#39; performance on IQ tests continued to improve over time: According to records from 1932 to 1978, the average American IQ increased in 46 years scored 13.8 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The apparent increase in IQ scores over several generations seems unlikely to be caused by genetic evolution. Flynn therefore suspected that this must be caused by changes in environmental factors, meaning that IQ is influenced more by the environment than by genetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To test his conjecture, Flynn expanded his research to 14 countries, including all races. The results found that IQ scores in 14 countries have improved over time over the past half century. Among them, East Asia has the fastest growth, and the average IQ in East Asia is higher than that in Europe and the United States. The IQ of humans around the world is increasing over time. This discovery was called the &quot;Flynn effect&quot; by later scholars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flynn himself believes that there are no genetic differences in intelligence between races, and that intelligence is affected by environmental factors such as education, economy, and social culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, various countries have followed up and conducted studies, all of which have confirmed that the Flynn Effect does exist. However, by the end of the twentieth century, the Flynn Effect suddenly failed in developed countries. Statistics from the University of Vienna in Austria found that between 1962 and 1975, the growth rate of average IQ slowed down significantly; and between 1975 and 1991, it directly stagnated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, scholars thought this was a normal phenomenon: the average IQ in developed countries may have reached the upper limit and will no longer increase with the improvement of education and medical care; but the IQ in developing countries is still rising, and finally Countries will reach a level close to each other. However, as I continued to record, I found that the average IQ in developed countries has not stagnated, but has begun to regress! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, a joint survey by Finland and Denmark found that since the mid-1990s, the IQ test scores of recruits in the two countries have been declining at an average annual rate of 0.25%. In fact, as early as 2008, a British scholar discovered that the average score of 14-year-old British teenagers on thinking tests at that time was only equivalent to that of 12-year-old children in 1976. They believed that &quot;the intelligence of British young people has regressed greatly. It is almost certainly due to the popularity of televisions and computer games, as well as too frequent exams in schools.&quot; But this reason is far-fetched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published a paper in 2016: A research team discovered a gene that is highly related to academic qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They first studied high-educated people and low-educated people, and found that there was a significant frequency difference in this genotype between the two groups. This genotype was then used to predict the future education level of the child, and the results were verified more accurately. Exactly how this genotype affects brain development remains unclear. However, another large study of more than 100,000 people in Iceland showed that this gene may affect the age of childbearing, thereby indirectly affecting the level of education. However, how it affects the age of childbearing is still unknown. It is very likely that Still an indirect effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, regardless of the mechanism of action, the research team discovered a serious problem:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This genotype has been eliminated from generation to generation among Icelanders. In other words, the educational level of the new generation may continue to decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because people with a high level of education will delay the age of marriage and childbirth, the number of children will decrease, and they will even end up not getting married and having children, and they will eventually eliminate themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although analyzed on a ten-year basis, the influence of genes is still very small and almost negligible: the continuous decrease of this &quot;reading gene&quot; among Icelanders is speculated to cause the average IQ of Icelanders to drop every ten years. The annual decrease was 0.04. If all genes related to education conform to this rule, then this number is only 0.3 - which seems to be nothing compared to the improvement in IQ brought about by acquired environmental improvements such as education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, environmental improvements such as universal education have limits. The elimination of genes from generation to generation is eternal, so that the research team also warned: &quot;If this situation continues for centuries, the consequences will be very serious.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This research in Iceland has not yet been carried out. It has been verified in other groups, but the problem suggested by the study is very general:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humans around the world, especially those in areas with higher education levels, are likely to face this problem - it seems that smart people are constantly Self-elimination. Of course, the concept of &quot;higher education level&quot; seems to require further analysis: is it longer years of education, higher academic qualifications, or both? Is it the values ​​instilled in them during their education that affect their desire to have children and their fertility rate? This requires further research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为A股做空制度打补丁，限售股融券制度为何引争议？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258955]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Amid the storm of public opinion, regulators patched the A-share short-selling system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that it would gradually tighten securities lending and strategic investor placement share lending. Securities lending is currently the most important short-selling system in the A-share market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the newly listed company Jindi Shares (603270.SH) was the subject of intense public controversy. On the first day of listing in early September, Jindi shares were shorted by large amounts of securities lending. Later, after verification by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the loaned shares came from a company&#39;s core employee management plan, commonly known as the &quot;strategic investment plan.&quot; Because they are held by insiders, these strategic investment shares are usually regarded as &quot;restricted shares&quot;, and their biggest feature is that they are not negotiable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Science and Technology Innovation Board was launched in 2019, allowing some restricted stocks to be included in the scope of securities lending, and will be fully implemented on the main board in 2023. The original intention of the policy is to &quot;bring down&quot; the price of new shares by expanding the source of securities and strengthening the power of short selling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, even if all the shares of the above-mentioned asset management plan were lent for short selling, Jindi shares were still issued and listed at a high price-earnings ratio of nearly 84 times. The closing price on the first day increased by more than 121 yuan compared with the issue price of 21 yuan. %. However, the stock price fell by nearly 30% in the following two weeks. Not only did securities lending fail to curb speculation in new stocks, it was also blamed by investors as the culprit of the decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar situations are not uncommon in new stocks. Southern Weekend reporters used financial statistics from Caihui. As of the last trading day in September, 66 of the 189 listed companies that had IPO&#39;d this year had lent their shares through strategic investment plans on the first day of issuance, changing &quot;restricted sales&quot; to &quot;tradable&quot;. &quot;. More than half of them have a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 50, which is a high-priced issue. Kweichow Moutai, which has the largest A-share market value, has a price-to-earnings ratio of only 32. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many interviewees told Southern Weekend reporters that the contradiction does not lie in the securities lending business itself, but in the fact that the scarce securities sources are concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, resulting in no securities to borrow in the market, especially for new stocks. Even more so, because most of the securities are locked in the restricted shares of the original shareholders. We originally wanted to use the securities sources of strategic investors to solve this problem, but this resulted in the restricted shares in the hands of major shareholders being circulated in disguise, and the policy &quot;fighted&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When short selling can only be participated by a small number of people, the supply and demand of securities sources are out of balance, and the inflated issuance price makes short selling a profit-free transaction, the price discovery function of A-share IPOs cannot be said to be effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/gmI5x7bPY8ZlBNBJIduTMJzG8XDVyCpzWSM2ZBBy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height= &quot;845&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/gmI5x7bPY8ZlBNBJIduTMJzG8XDVyCpzWSM2ZBBy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254697&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The listing of Jindi Shares triggered a controversy over strategic investment in restricted stocks and securities lending. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Since it is a restricted stock, why do we need to let it circulate?&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to characterize the strategic investment and asset management plan of Jindi Shares is the main disagreement in the market. “No issues such as detours by relevant entities to reduce holdings or collusion in conveying benefits were found,” is the conclusion of the China Securities Regulatory Commission after verification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The essence of borrowing is to bet on the subsequent trend of stocks. Once the stock price falls, investors can buy the stock in the market at a cheaper price and return it to the lender. The difference between the borrowed stock and the actual purchase of the stock is the investor&#39;s profit. The cost depends on the interest paid to the lender, that is, the rate. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned securities lending of 4.7 million shares of Jindi Shares was divided into 7 financings, each with a term of 27 days, and the number of financings were 390,000 shares (financing rate 21.6%), 1.413 million shares (fee) 22.6%), 160,000 shares (23.6% fee), 2.477 million shares (24.6% fee), 20,000 shares (25.6% fee), 80,000 shares (27.6% fee), 160,000 shares (24.6% fee), 160,000 shares (27.6% fee), rate 28.1%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yuan Yuwei, a senior hedge fund manager currently living in Paris, told Southern Weekend reporters that the annual rate of 28% is relatively high in the current market. “The price of each ticket changes every day and is not fixed. As a rule, the larger the ticket, the cheaper it is. The lowest rate can be around 5%, while small tickets are basically between 5% and 10%, and there are also 20%.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The executives of Jindi Shares are lending the restricted shares in the above-mentioned asset management plan to investors in exchange for interest income on the securities. The higher fee rate means that the market is flocking to the source of the stock. In other words, there are many investors who want to short the stock price of Jindi, and the stock price may be artificially high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Jindi Shares announcement, the number of strategic placements is 4,700,871 shares, accounting for 8.58% of the issued number. It is called Jindi Shares Asset Management Plan (including Plan 1 and Plan 2), with a sales restriction period of 12 months and a total amount of 102.3 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What surprised Yuan Yuwei was that the source of the stock&#39;s securities was the shareholding of core executives. According to the company law or securities law, these restricted shares, whether held directly or through an asset management plan, can only be sold after the lock-up period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also the focus of controversy for Jindi Shares. In the stock forum, which has more than 480 pages and nearly 38,000 shareholder discussions, more than half are asking the same question: Is the refinancing of Jindi Shares reasonable? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since it is a restricted stock, why let it circulate? The major shareholders even earn interest (rate) by doing so, which is strictly prohibited abroad because it violates the rights of the secondary market. Rights.&quot; Yuan Yuwei said that in the U.S. and European capital markets he is familiar with, restricted stocks mean that they are not tradable. Not only the buying and selling of stocks, but also the profit from restricted stocks are strictly restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also the focus of this regulatory adjustment - &quot;Adjust and optimize the securities lending system&quot;, &quot;cancel the lending of special asset management plans established by executives and core employees of listed companies through participation in strategic placements, and moderately restrict other strategies Investors’ lending methods and proportions in the early stages of listing.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The price of new shares is artificially high, is it possible to lock in profits through securities lending? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for stocks to have similar operations to Jindi Shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, 66 of the 189 listed companies that have IPO&#39;d this year have lent shares through the Strategic Investment Plan on the first day of issuance, with a total amount of 5.932 billion. If ranked by the amount of securities lending, Jindi shares ranked fourth among 66 listed companies with 221 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to Jindi Shares, Surbana Security (688651.SH) suffered more than 90 million yuan in securities lending on its first day of listing on July 26. The company responded to investors by calling it &quot;a strategic Investors lend”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market’s doubts about Jindi shares are not unreasonable. Since there is a serious information asymmetry between the actual controllers of listed companies and ordinary investors, the restricted stock system can tie the interests of directors, supervisors and senior executives to those of listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Information asymmetry may lead to the problem of controllers running away in advance. That is, after the company goes public, the business situation deteriorates and the performance changes dramatically, and they throw the mess to the market. This phenomenon occurs in A The stock market is not uncommon.&quot; Huang Jianzhong, a former investment banker and associate professor of the Department of Finance at Shanghai Normal University Business School, explained to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He pointed out that if directors, supervisors and senior executives are allowed to cash out in advance, the above situation will become more serious. Therefore, under the current registration system, not only the interests of major shareholders are required to be bound, but also the sponsoring securities companies must also participate in the investment. The essence is to serve the interests of the bound listed companies and securities companies, and make the securities companies responsible for running away early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued relevant systems for the full implementation of the registration system, and the refinancing business was further liberalized. It not only broadens the scope of underlying securities and lenders, but also adjusts the original &quot;fixed term, fixed rate&quot; model to a market-based declaration method. Lenders and borrowers can independently negotiate the refinancing term, rate, extension or early settlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The major shareholder of Jindi Co., Ltd. joined the scope of refinancing lending through its identity as a strategic investor. According to the latest data from the Securities Finance Corporation, there are currently 3,293 listed companies on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets that have entered the two financing lists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If a listed company simply borrows securities, it cannot be considered to be reducing its holdings, because its operation process is for the listed company to give the securities to the securities and finance company, and the securities and finance company to the securities and finance company. The company will then be financed by the securities company to the investors who borrowed the securities. After two hands were passed in the middle, different securities will be mixed together, so it is difficult for the lender to reduce its holdings through manipulation.&quot; Professor of Peking University Law School and securities law expert Peng Bing explained to Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also the focus of regulatory verification. It is guaranteed that Jindi shares and the final investors are not related transactions, excluding the possibility of cooperative arbitrage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What Huang Jianzhong is more worried about is that the prices of new shares are generally artificially high, and major shareholders of listed companies cooperate with external institutions to carry out arbitrage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The stock price and price-to-earnings ratio of Jindi Shares are relatively high. If the issuance of new shares is accompanied by a refinancing policy, there may be problems in order to meet listing requirements and support high valuations, thereby packaging performance. Actual Controller They know the actual situation of the company best. If they lend stocks, it involves insider trading. If the performance changes after half a year, the hidden problem will be even greater.&quot; Huang Jianzhong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Bing is also worried about this. &quot;Because major shareholders understand that the inflated stock price will eventually fall, they circulate restricted shares in the market to lock in the profits from the borrowing part in advance.&quot; At this time, the price of new shares increased. The higher the value, the more beneficial it is to major shareholders, because more people will borrow securities to short-sell after the listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the policy gap opened by refinancing does not make it possible for major shareholders to directly reduce their holdings, it may increase the motivation of major shareholders to falsify their performance, because even if the stock price of the restricted shares in their hands falls, the major shareholders You can still lock in some profits in advance by lending stocks through refinancing. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Allow some people to short-sell first&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to Peng Bing’s observation, the average premium level in the US primary and secondary markets is between 10% and 20%, but the price of domestic new shares can double or triple on the first day. &quot;In the past, the phenomenon of A-shares flocking to speculate in new stocks was largely due to the stipulated price-earnings ratio of 23 times. Under the registration system, pricing was relaxed but the speculation was still hot, which is not normal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A report from Huachuang Securities shows that as of September 24, the total turnover of the A-share market in 2023 was approximately 159.3 trillion yuan, and the sales volume of securities lending was 943.3 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 0.3% . From 2019 to 2022, China&#39;s securities lending balance/total market value increased from 0.02% to 0.11%. However, compared with the United States, the total securities lending balance is still significantly lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main means of checking and balancing stock price speculation in the United States is short selling. The A-share securities lending system also has the same effect, but the effect is not obvious. Part of the reason is that the supply of securities sources is insufficient, resulting in an imbalance of long and short forces. Only a few people to participate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Commission income and interest on securities borrowing are the main sources of income from the securities lending business. The greater the customer&#39;s transaction volume and the higher the transaction frequency, the higher the securities firm&#39;s income. Brokerages are naturally more willing to lend their securities sources to private equity funds and quantitative funds that use high-frequency trading strategies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Customers who have opened the two-financing business can directly inquire about coupons from the brokerage firm where they opened an account, but not every customer can get the coupons. &quot;The first is to look at the transaction size, and the second is to look at the turnover rate.&quot; Feng Ruifeng, who works in the self-operated department of a large securities firm in Shanghai, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Feng Ruifeng’s securities firm as an example. In addition to opening a margin account, he is also required to hold more than 3.5 million yuan in trading funds before he can lock the securities, that is, the underlying securities source is locked in advance, and the rate is based on the securities source. The specific situation will be determined later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The greater the stock price fluctuation, the higher the fee rate. Because the policy allows securities lending to conduct T+0 transactions without overnight positions, for those stocks with large price fluctuations, the T+0 strategy is naturally The more room for profit there is, the more people will borrow bonds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次金帝股份的出借对象为35名个人投资者和89家私募基金，机构数量远多于个人。冯锐风判断，除了89家私募基金，其余35名个人投资者大概率是资金量堪比小私募的游资大鳄。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出了高价还拿不到券，这类情况在A股并不罕见。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在美股市场，只要市场有券，我出了钱就基本都能拿到，几乎没有遇到过找不着券源的情况。”袁玉玮坦言，如果所在券商没有券源，还可以找其他券商进行拆借。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在限制开户数上国内外也有区别。两融账户用作信用交易，存在一定比例的杠杆。为了控制投资者的交易风险，目前监管规定单个投资者只能开通一家证券公司的信用账户。袁玉玮告诉南方周末记者，这一点在美国也并无限制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;散户开设融资融券账户的门槛也颇高，根据证监会2015年发布的《证券公司融资融券业务管理办法》，“最近20个交易日日均证券类资产不低于50万元”是开设两融账户的首要条件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但中国结算的数据显示，截至今年8月底，A股开设的个人两融账户数量为661.26万，同期的A股个人投资者账户数量约为2.21亿，能够参与做空的散户只仅占总体2.99%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为各家券商的券源池子并不相同，如果客户所在开户券商手中并没有想要的券源，客户又无法在其他券商处开户融券，这就在客观上加大了融券难度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;股券源&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;为何稀缺？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;目前A股融券交易的券源主要来自券商自有股票和转融通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;券商自有股票数量相当有限。 “这部分券源基本都是尽着大客户的，和券商业务往来深的客户一般能优先获得。”冯锐风说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;转融通则通过借用其他机构获得的券源，是目前券源主力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但相比美国等海外市场，A股券源缺少了两个重要来源——个人和上市公司大股东。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美股投资者与券商签订开户合同后，会被提示是否要开通“股票收益增强”功能，简单理解，是将个人账户内的股票借给市场上的空头们，并获取利息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在美国大部分投资人都会签署这项合同，这在一定程度上扩大了借券的券源，也加强了个股的流动性。”担任某外资对冲基金高管的陈凯旋告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;向市场出借后，虽然短期内股票会有波动，但并不影响长期走势，投资者还能有一笔额外的利息收入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更主要的券源来自大股东，也就是限售股。这也是美国资本市场主要的券源，但在国内受到严格的减持制度限制，并未在市场上流通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位前监管人士对南方周末记者说，如果将限售股全流通，将解决股票供给难题，市场充分估值后新股不再稀缺，上市公司实控人则无法通过人为控制公司新股的数量来人为提高价格。但另一方面，也会打破A股炒新神话，进而影响一、二级市场溢价。 &lt;br>;&lt;br>;“只有维持了IPO上市的高溢价，才能让新股发行市场有大量的资金云集在&#39;打新&#39;的地方。”他说，全流通显然对新股价格有破坏性作用。而一旦二级市场的新股价格被打下来，还会进一步降低一级市场价格，以及那些早期投资者手中的股票价值。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;美股为何不限售&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“在美国，公司治理的主要方式是分散瓦解上市公司控制权。股权越分散，对中小投资人的保护也往往越好。而不是通过限制出售实控人的股份。”新加坡城市大学法学院副院长张巍向南方周末记者谈到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美股市场也有限售制度，和A股最大的不同在于，其并非是监管勒令，而是券商、交易所和上市公司之间博弈的结果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈凯旋所在机构是多次上市公司的战略投资者，他解释，这项制度名为锁定期(lock-up period)，一般上市公司实控人和券商签署商业协定，在公司上市后90天至180天限制出售持股。理由同样是防备在上市后原始股东立刻减持套现，致使股价大起大落。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;SEC（美国证券交易委员会）并没有规定上市公司必须要签署限售协议，但是制定了法条，解释哪些股份可以被称作限售股以及限售的例外条例。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国限售制度的法理依据名为144号法令，具体规定了限售执行细节，并将限售股分为限制证券（restricted securities）和控制证券（control securities）两类，前者主要存在私募发行，后者指公司实控人手中的股票，也是A股限售制度的对象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“控制证券也就是国内所谓的&#39;老股&#39;，SEC只是限制承销商（券商）IPO后30日内不能卖空，他们一般也会认购一部分新股，但对投资人通过自己的经纪商出借股票没有限制。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;144实则是对哪些限售股可以例外在市场上流通做出了规定。比如，纽交所和纳斯达克为6个月，6个月锁定期之后，股东每三个月可以出售的股份数额。不能超过同类已发行股份的1%或四周内平均周交易量的较大者，且必须事先向证监会报备。对企业高管层、董事等内幕信息知情者则特别规定，减持大于500股或交易额大于1万美元要向证监会报备。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张巍解释，国内对144号法令存在一定误解，在美股，监管防范的重点是内幕交易，144条例正是对一系列限售股流通设计了一条通道，“这里所谓的限制，并不是不准转售，而是要求先行注册。美国法律监管的不是公司控制人&#39;减持&#39;，而是未经（再次）注册转让股票的行为，要求他们进行公开披露”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实控人上市后立即抛售的情况在美股中并不少见。比如阿里巴巴的IPO中，老股占发行总量的近62%，大股东Yahoo上市后一次性出手1.2亿股，占当时总股本的4.9%，套现80多亿美元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有知名私募基金黑石集团（Blackstone）创始人彼得·彼得森（Peter G. Peterson），他在回忆录《黑石的选择》中曾提到，券商并未把这位创始人纳入限售合同，他本人在上市后一次性套现了18.5亿美元，并用这笔资金创立了知名智库彼得森研究所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，只有真正受市场追捧的公司才敢于有恃无恐地在IPO阶段进行大量老股转让。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，冯锐风、陈凯旋为化名）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;棉花娃娃，是指身长10-40厘米不等，主体用棉花、聚酯纤维等制成的玩偶娃娃。棉花娃娃最早是韩国娱乐圈的应援物，2015年，韩国一家经纪公司率先将娱乐明星的形象卡通化，制作成棉花娃娃，成为粉丝的应援物。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;之后，棉花娃娃在饭圈广泛流行，粉丝纷纷DIY以偶像为原型的棉花娃娃，既可以当作应援物，也可以是粉丝收藏的偶像周边。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;之后，棉花娃娃从韩国娱乐圈传播到我国，并有了全新的发展。国内的棉花娃娃不仅是作为粉丝产品而存在，它也形成了一条独立的赛道——很多“娃妈”自己设计独一无二的棉花娃娃，在平台上开团，组团成功后再让厂家制作，收货后“娃妈”的养娃之旅开启。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;用娃圈的分类，棉花娃娃分为“有属性”和“无属性”两类。“有属性”，即有原型，或是明星，或是一些得到授权的影视人物，它们更多是粉丝经济的产物。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“无属性”，即没有原型，棉花娃娃是“娃妈”的原创，可以根据自己的喜好去“定制”。国内的棉花娃娃圈，以“无属性”的棉花娃娃为主，很多年轻人把棉花娃娃“当娃养”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;成立于2019年的“棉花美娃娃”微博超话，如今已经有超过146万“娃妈”，帖子数量超过370万，阅读量超过280亿次。超话的帖子，以“无属性”的棉花娃娃为主。另据棉花娃娃主要交易平台微店2022年初发布的《2021棉花娃娃玩家洞察报告》，在棉花娃娃的玩家大军中，00后占比最高，达到43%，排在第二的95后，占比达到26%，而当年棉花娃娃线上交易额已经突破10亿元大关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;可以说，棉花娃娃已经形成一种蔚为壮观的亚文化现象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/ZwnTwoNo1EJJ17WDBbQr3mWMky2SR5TfFDQSfCSe.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Z世代用户占到棉花娃娃玩家的70%，年轻一代为什么迷上了棉花娃娃？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;就那些“有属性”的棉花娃娃而言，主要还是饭圈文化的延伸。比如以偶像为原型的棉花娃娃就像是偶像的化身，可以满足粉丝的情感投射。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但对于那些DIY、“无属性”的棉花娃娃而言，乐趣则在于“当娃养”的情感治愈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;那些DIY的棉花娃娃，虽然五官不同，形态各异，但TA们有一个强烈的共同点，非常萌。“萌”主要用来表示那些可以激发人们极为强烈、深刻的情感，包括喜欢、恋慕、为之倾倒、执着、兴奋等的人、事和物。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一方面，爱“萌”之心，人皆有之。奥地利动物学家康拉德·洛伦茨提出了“幼体滞留”的观点，他指出：喜欢一切有幼体特征的东西，是人的天性，而这些这些可爱的动物有着大眼、大头、短鼻等特征，这也就可以解释，为什么幼童、小猫、小狗更容易唤起人们的喜爱之情。同理，保留幼体特征的棉花娃娃，非常卡哇伊，萌态十足，令人倾心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;另一方面，“萌”具有情感治愈功能。从心理学层面看，那些不具攻击性、平和无争，能够抚慰心灵，给人以持续、恒久舒畅感的一系列事物，都有助于人们排解孤独、忧郁等感伤情绪。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;年轻的Z世代把棉花娃娃“当娃养”的过程，犹如《小王子》中，小王子对于玫瑰的情感投入。小王子为玫瑰竖过屏风、盖过玻璃罩子、除过毛虫、听过她的抱怨，付出了时间、情感和精力；每个养棉花娃娃的年轻人也是如此，为自家的娃娃买过衣服、换过衣服、向TA倾诉心事、带着TA到处旅行、带TA到海底捞为TA过生日……&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如同玫瑰对于小王子而言是独一无二的，每一只得到“娃妈”情感投入的棉花娃娃，之于“娃妈”也是独一无二的。所以，对于新闻中带棉花娃娃去吃海底捞的年轻人，不理解很正常，但也不必着急去嘲讽和否定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;也值得一提的是，不同于很多亚文化产品价格居高不下，棉花娃娃的价格往往很平民。一些“无属性”的棉花娃娃价格在几十元到一百元之间，娃衣价格会比较贵，但“娃妈”也可以自己买布料DIY，这是很多“娃妈”的乐趣。平民化的治愈系，促成了棉花娃娃的进一步走红。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;相较于盲盒、手办等产业而言，棉花娃娃的市场空间还有待进一步挖掘。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当前棉花娃娃赛道，主要是“有属性”和“无属性”两种。“有属性”这一赛道的新趋势是，越来越多的正规军加入。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此前，很多“有属性”棉花娃娃，是粉丝私自的“二创”，在侵权的边界上游走，比如口头不直接说以某个明星或者某个剧中形象为原型，可粉丝群体都知道，就是以其为原型。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如今很多影视制作方，主动将棉花娃娃作为衍生品的一部分，官方制作“有属性”的棉花娃娃，面向公众出售。不仅是新IP推出了棉花娃娃，比如此前的《山河令》《有翡》《苍兰诀》《梦华录》《猎罪图鉴》等，一些老IP也来分一杯羹，比如《甄嬛传》《喜羊羊与灰太狼》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;对于棉花娃娃这一新兴市场而言，这种正规化是必要的。既可以扩大圈层，也有助于棉花娃娃产业链条的成熟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当前，“无属性”的棉花娃娃仍然是主流，其商业模式主要是“DIY设计+自发拼团+少量定制”，本质上是小作坊模式。这一模式的当务之急是，提升棉花娃娃产业链条每一个环节的专业化程度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;小作坊，不意味着就是粗制滥造、小打小闹，对于强调个性化的棉花娃娃而言，“小作坊”反而是它的一种生态。只是，棉花娃娃可以“小众”，但棉花娃娃的设计环节、娃娃的制作环节、娃衣的制作环节，都应该提高专业度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此前很多拼团式的棉花娃娃，会出现质量不过关、细节很粗糙、货不对板等情形，这会打击“娃妈”的热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我国是世界上最大的玩具生产国，玩具生产能力毋庸赘言。希望一些大型玩具厂商可以介入棉花娃娃市场，提供专业化、标准化、体系化的棉花娃娃定制服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;玩具市场已经是红海竞争，棉花娃娃或是一片新蓝海，就看谁能把握机遇了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国籍女子在美酒驾致人死亡：死者在国内的父母如何伸张正义？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258921]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a piece of news that &quot;a Chinese woman died while driving drunk and speeding in the United States&quot; has attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Jimu News, this incident occurred in Bellevue, Washington, USA. The woman involved and the man killed are both Chinese citizens. After the incident, the woman involved refused to provide any information related to the deceased to the local police in the United States. She was also charged with vehicular homicide. Friends of the deceased told reporters that the woman involved concealed the incident from them, resulting in them not knowing that the deceased had been killed for many days. Not only that, the woman involved was suspected to have returned to the country before the US police issued an arrest warrant on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on U.S. media reports, local court indictments, and information released by the deceased’s former friends in the United States, a timeline of this case can be established. At 3:45 a.m. on September 30, the woman in question drove a Porsche 911 drunk and hit a concrete guardrail in Bellevue at a speed of 90 miles (144.84 kilometers per hour). The vehicle rolled over and was damaged. The man in the passenger seat died at the scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the police and firefighters arrived at the scene at 4:10 a.m., the woman involved refused to disclose any information about the deceased, and there was a &quot;strong smell of alcohol in her breath and speech.&quot; Since the woman involved also suffered minor injuries, she first went to the hospital for treatment and took an alcohol blood test three hours later. The police investigated the case in the following days. The local court issued an indictment on October 6, accusing the woman of &quot;driving to kill&quot;, and the police also issued an arrest warrant on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the deceased’s former friends, they discovered on October 13 that the woman in question had left Seattle before the U.S. police issued an arrest warrant and was suspected of having returned to China. WeChat chat records show that the woman involved first said, &quot;Go to the police station and ask, I can&#39;t contact him&quot; and &quot;Are you telling the truth?&quot;, and then said, &quot;It&#39;s really okay, he is safe now&quot;; finally After the death was confirmed, he said, &quot;His family should know the truth,&quot; &quot;I want to return to China to find his parents,&quot; and &quot;I was seriously injured and need to return to China to rest.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The facts that can be determined in the entire case are: the woman involved was drunk and speeding, causing the death of the man in the passenger seat; the woman involved concealed the death information of the deceased after the incident; the woman involved did not arrive at the scene He has lost contact with the case and is suspected to have returned to China. At the same time, he has deleted all the content on social media. Facts that are still unclear in the case include: what is the relationship between the deceased and the woman involved; whether the deceased knew about the woman&#39;s drunk driving in advance; whether the deceased himself was drunk, and how did he get into the car? This will all affect the distribution of accident liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the indictment in the King County Superior Court of Washington State, the woman involved needs to pay a bail of up to 2 million US dollars, and her passport should be confiscated. If the woman in question has indeed returned to the country, then she should have taken advantage of the gap in the police investigation to return to the country with her passport before the arrest warrant was issued. Without paying bail, there was a time lag with the police and an information gap with the deceased&#39;s friends. , completed the &quot;run away with a bucket&quot; in a short period of time, which is also consistent with the information spread online that the woman involved &quot;continues to report that she is safe on social media.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, the WeChat conversations between the woman involved and the deceased’s friend were also contradictory. She said, &quot;I want to go back to China to find his parents,&quot; and in a follow-up conversation, &quot;If you have the ability, you can go back to China and tell his parents this in person, or you can give his parents my contact information. This is the best way.&quot; &quot;In this case. Judging from this, the woman involved should not have taken the initiative to contact the parents and friends of the deceased in the days after the incident. Then, the statements of &quot;he was seriously injured&quot;, &quot;needs to return to China to rest&quot;, and &quot;find the parents of the deceased&quot; are probably untenable. It is inevitable that people will suspect that they are to cooperate with the real purpose of &quot;buying time to avoid arrest and return to China as soon as possible to protect themselves&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the woman did violated moral standards and violated the laws of both China and the United States. Drunk driving requires criminal liability. The criminal code of Washington State shows that &quot;driving to kill&quot; is a Class A felony, with the maximum penalty being life imprisonment and a fine of $80,000; Article 133 of the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;violation of traffic and transportation management regulations, resulting in a major If an accident causes serious injury or death to a person or causes heavy losses to public or private property, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is not the first case of &quot;committing crimes in the United States and then escaping back to the country.&quot; In the 2015 &quot;Case of Murder of a Chinese Girl Studying in the United States&quot;, the suspect fled back to the country right after the incident, but the Chinese and American police brought the suspect to justice in accordance with the &quot;China-U.S. Criminal Judicial Assistance Agreement.&quot; The circumstances of this case are different. Judging from the current situation, even if the parents of the deceased initiate a criminal private prosecution in China, they will still face a series of difficulties in evidence collection procedures, case determination, and accident liability division. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, the woman involved refused to provide any information about the deceased to the police after the incident and did not make efforts to deal with the aftermath, which was unkind; she concealed information about the deceased’s death from the circle of relatives and friends of the deceased, and even created “ &quot;It&#39;s very safe&quot; and pretending not to know is unjust; it is illegal to create a time difference and information gap through technology and use it to fly back to the country to evade charges. No matter from the perspective of emotion, reason, or law, the woman involved could get away with it so easily, which undermines fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the parents of the deceased have the right to continue criminal private prosecution, strive to continue to seek public relief under the framework of the &quot;China-US Criminal Judicial Assistance Agreement&quot;, and give justice to the deceased. It is also necessary for the public sector to take action to pursue the legal responsibility of the woman involved based on the personal principle, so as to prevent the perpetrators from going unpunished and maintain social fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[尽管发生尴尬的偷窃事件，南阳真的很想让音乐节留下]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259039]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/20/zt64JEq393bR8kyisbmEvvuKcVh5qdtjrZnlCZaN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/zt64JEq393bR8kyisbmEvvuKcV h5qdtjrZnlCZaN. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254768&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2023, the venue was muddy due to rain, and staff were on the ground Planks were laid &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Trouble&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Positioning To the &quot;Green Field Monologue&quot;, the taxi passed through Huangshan Village and stopped steadily at the entrance of a muddy open space.

So far, Nanyang police have received 73 reports and implemented 65 theft cases. Some thieves have been captured and detained, and some of the thieves have been recovered. Property.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aunt Yu stood behind her house. The distance between her backyard and the music festival venue was only two meters. After hearing my purpose, she looked at me warily, &quot;Are you here to blackmail us?&quot; After receiving a negative answer, she was dubious, &quot;This is the stage, this is my home, you can see it&#39;s so close.&quot; She said as she spoke Make gestures with your hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before the start of the music festival, people from the town government went to Huangshan Village to mobilize and called on everyone to visit relatives and friends. &quot;Especially those with children and elderly people at home, try not to live here.&quot; Aunt Yu&#39;s The grandson was sent to his grandmother&#39;s house and did not return until the music festival was over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the music festival, the speakers at the venue roared from 1pm to 10:30pm. Aunt Yu didn’t know what rock music was, and she just felt that her “heart was beating out of her chest.” The water heater in her home was &quot;whispering&quot; and the paintings in the house were shaking. More than a dozen security guards stood outside the door every night. After they left around 11 o&#39;clock, she would &quot;wash and tidy up before going to bed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I asked her how she slept.

The weather was not good, and &quot;people were working in the rain. On one day at most, there were more than 80 people on the site.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The road was built earlier, and construction started as soon as the contract was signed. Half a month before the opening of the music festival, workers began to build the stage, and trucks transporting equipment came and went. Because of the rain, the repaired road was no longer working. &quot;The soil compactor has been rolling, and wooden boards have been added.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&quot;Green Field Monologue&quot; is located in the north of Nanyang City, close to the Dushan Expressway Toll Station, covering an area of ​​three to four hundred acres. The name &quot;Green Field Monologue&quot; was given by Zhang Fanqi, the founder of Midi. When taken apart, it represents Green Grassland, Dushan and White River respectively. In the past, &quot;this land was expropriated by the government, and some rent was paid every year. It has always been in a state of neglect.&quot; Aunt Yu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August, Nanyang Wolong District signed an industry-wide strategic cooperation agreement with Midi Music School. Public reports indicate that the two parties will carry out all-round and in-depth cooperation starting from the holding of the 2023 Central Plains Midi Music Festival. Zhang Fan said in an interview, &quot;The fate between Midi and Nanyang began four years ago. During this period, the two parties had many exchanges to discuss cooperation.

At the meeting, Nanyang Municipal Party Committee Secretary Zhu Shixi pointed out that efforts should be made to make the Zhongyuan Midi Music Festival a city card that shows the image of Nanyang, a cultural feast that promotes the upgrading of cultural tourism, and achieve the goal of &quot;running a good music festival and activating a city.&quot; , the goal of making a city famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve this goal, the preparatory work will particularly emphasize: &quot;Learn from the experience and practices of Zibo Barbecue Out of the Circle, mobilize all walks of life and the general public to fully develop the sense of &#39;ownership&#39;, actively participate, proactively serve, and sincerely Hospitality, fully publicize and display the good image of Nanyang people&#39;s enthusiasm, kindness, civilization and hospitality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to welcome music fans from all over the city, promotional slogans related to the Midi Music Festival are posted throughout the city, such as &quot;Do A good music festival, a good host.” Some of them had not been demolished until ten days after the festival ended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Chang is a volunteer at the Media Center of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival. He started participating in the Midi Music Festival ten years ago. In her experience, Midi started &quot;going north&quot; in 2019. She took this opportunity to visit cities such as Binzhou and Chongli that she would not usually visit when traveling. She has traveled to many places, but she has never seen a city as hardworking as Nanyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Chang arrived in Nanyang on September 28th earlier than the average music fan. Later, I heard from a friend that &quot;the mayor and the secretary of the municipal party committee personally went to the train station to greet the music fans on the 29th and gave out a large gift package.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first day of the music festival was the Mid-Autumn Festival. After the performance, as a volunteer, she also received mooncakes from the local area. In places where traffic is restricted, the local government provides free shuttle buses for music fans to ride until the early morning. After work every night, she would take a shuttle bus and then take a taxi back to the hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“They actually welcome (music fans). We wear muddy rain boots every day to take a taxi, and the driver doesn’t mind. There is also a special rain boots rinse for music fans at the entrance of the hotel where Midi staff stays. water gun.&quot; During his few days in Nanyang, the locals left a rustic impression on Liu Chang. Anti-riot iron horses separated the music festival site from nearby residential areas. Some villagers watched the performance with great interest on the second floor of their homes.

People say this is rock and roll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of the rain, the four-day music festival was nicknamed the &quot;Mud Flute&quot;, but this is not the first time the Midi Music Festival has encountered rainy days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, the Midi Music Festival held in Zhenjiang also had a particularly bad venue due to rain. &quot;But it was not as bad as this time. It was indeed a bit difficult this time.&quot; Music practitioner Chen Xiaobei recalled. &quot;Everyone had a great time in Zhenjiang last time. More than ten years later, we had another mud play experience, and it was in a worse environment. Everyone had a great time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first original creation in China Music Festival, Midi has gone through 23 years, and Midi Music School was established even earlier. “The establishment of Midi Music School in 1993 provided professional knowledge and a river of convergence for young people who love rock music across the country.

I thought Maybe someone took it by mistake.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Missing along with the tent was Momo&#39;s suitcase. She later found it at the edge of a path in the venue. “It was opened, and there were a few hats, Midi posters, and power strips missing. Because I had always carried valuables with me, there were no A lot of property was lost.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When doing the finishing work that day, momo called an aunt riding a tricycle to help, &quot;She has been carrying some suitcases, maybe she wants to keep them for herself, but those boxes It belongs to our group, so I told her that it belongs to me, don’t move it around.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Exactly like the official report, Li Wei’s power bank was lost in the camping area. It rained all day on October 1 and the temperature dropped. Li Wei and his friends spent the night in the car. When he returned to the camp the next day, he found that not only his belongings were missing, but even his tent was gone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/zOY6niv2rnBveWiFEB5EuEeZYvXA0l9JyJ70XXvL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/zOY6niv2rnBveWiFEB5EuEeZYvXA0l9JyJ70XXvL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254774&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;During the music festival, staff rested on explosion-proof iron horses&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;On October 12, we contacted Qiang Chen, the person in charge of the Midi Music Festival. He said on the phone that he had heard that someone’s things had been stolen since the evening of October 2. “Mainly in the camping area. Lord.&quot; They and Nanyang police launched an emergency plan on the morning of the 3rd to conduct a special investigation, and started to compensate on the 5th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wolong Media released a message on the evening of the 5th, saying, &quot;According to the current registration situation of music fans, 79 ID cards, 3 computers, and 17 mobile phones have been returned, and the remaining items are being verified and contacted.&quot; &quot;At present, Le The compensation rate for lost property reaches 90%,&quot; Qiangchen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wei called the police on the day he lost his belongings. Fifteen minutes later, he received a call from the police, asking him what he had lost and how much it was worth, and advising him not to worry. A few days later, he received another call from Midi staff, asking him about the brand and picture of the lost power bank, and introducing the specific compensation mechanism. “Then let those of us who lost things tell each other about the current compensation measures.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From beginning to end, Li Wei received a total of three calls about compensation. &quot;Their attitude was also very sincere.&quot; Later, he received a Midi inflatable sofa as compensation. In a &quot;Music Festival Lost Items&quot; WeChat group composed of three to four hundred people, Li Wei saw that some people had received souvenirs such as Midi&#39;s bracelets, towels, mooncakes, etc. Everyone was very satisfied with this way of handling it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some voices of loss, such as Liu Qifan who lost all his luggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;All he had left was his clothes, his watch, and his mobile phone.&quot; Without the help of his friends, it was hard for Liu Qifan to imagine how he would return home. Since October 3, he has recalled the things he lost too many times, “a black leather bag, a commemorative hoodie from Hamifa, a commemorative T-shirt from Midi in Central Plains, a volunteer T-shirt from Hailar, a postcard handwritten by a friend, Identity cards, bank cards, medicine for rhinitis...&quot; For him, what is more important are those items whose value cannot be measured by money. &quot;Memories cannot be bought.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/49Vn0QDjm7k7DFVjCa5HVjYhG4GgtSxIYFnzyKQk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/49Vn0QDjm7k7DFVjCa5HVjYhG4GgtSxIYFnzyKQk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254775&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;The stage being demolished&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Jiawei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Qifan also called the police. When he received a call from Midi’s official statistics on the value of lost items, he said that he had lost something worth 5,000 yuan. “As long as I can compensate 3,500 yuan, that’s enough.” The other party replied, “The amount needs to be submitted for approval before it will be released.” Later. 3,500 yuan was compressed to 3,000 yuan, and then to 2,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few days, Liu Qifan has called the Nanyang mayor’s hotline and received several calls from the local government and Midi, but has never received compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of his friends lost his camera, cosmetic bag and other items at the scene. The camera was later recovered, but the memory card was missing. Because of this incident, my friend still stays in Nanyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up this music festival, Qiang Chen believed, “On the one hand, after four days of intense work, the staff relaxed their security work at the end. On the other hand, this incident also gave us Warning, we should increase the publicity on legal awareness to music fans and residents near the music festival.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 3, Midi issued an announcement about the theft incident. Later, &quot;due to a large number of comments in the comment area, &quot;The remarks about Henan and Nanyang&quot; were deleted again. &quot;We don&#39;t want this matter to escalate into a regional confrontation. This is not what we want to do.&quot; Qiangchen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Qifan does not want the region to be dark. To be fair, this city has its tender side, but the day his things were stolen, he felt, &quot;I will never come to Henan again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Ashed Music Festival&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;After lunch, Huangshan Village was quiet. A woman grows garlic in the open space behind her house. She also grows green peppers and radishes in her vegetable patch, &quot;all of which are eaten by her family.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People in Huangshan Village like to be self-sufficient. The shelves of the small shop at the entrance of the village are stocked with water, drinks, melon seeds, tobacco and alcohol. &quot;People in the village are generally used to buying oil, salt, sauce and vinegar here.&quot; The shop is not big, and it mainly makes money by selling tobacco and alcohol. &quot;I can earn three to four thousand in a month. The key is that there are too many (supermarket operators), there are five or six.&quot; The middle-aged male shop owner complained to me while checking out. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the fate of many villages in Henan, most of the young adults in Huangshan Village have gone out to work, most recently in Nanyang City, and far away in various places, &quot;where they go.&quot; When people reach middle age, it becomes difficult to find a job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Uncle Han is 67 years old. He and his wife work in greening management in a residential area in the city. They sprinkle water, spray pesticides, and weed weeds every day, earning 2,500 yuan a month. &quot;Just take care of life.&quot; His expenses are not big, except for buying cigarettes - &quot;I have to buy one every half month.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, he has been supervising work at construction sites, and earlier, he was under supervision one party. &quot;You can make money by doing this, but it&#39;s too tiring and dangerous.&quot; As he got older, his daughter stopped letting him do it. When he was talking about this, he was planting spinach in the vegetable field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Uncle Han’s vegetable patch is not far from Aunt Yu’s house. To the right is the quiet village. To the left, the dusty &quot;Greenfield Monologue.&quot; In addition to the entrance to the village, another entrance to the site leads to Kongming Avenue. These days, cars have been coming in and out of that entrance, either driving into the venue and making a U-turn, or three or two people coming down to laugh and check in, or simply coming to see something rare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/FoWsD6mfCkot7IW7eyQZqZKOby48fdfvy0S5WDA6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/FoWsD6mfCkot7IW7eyQZqZKOby48fdfvy0S5WDA6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254776&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;More than ten days after the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, you can still see the equipment that has not yet been sorted out&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Jiawei/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten days after the Central Plains Midi Music Festival ended, many people were still patrolling the &quot;Green Field Monologue&quot; and taking photos. Occasionally, villagers passed by and walked away silently when they saw a stranger&#39;s face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The locals do not welcome the media. A man supervising the work at the scene complained to the people watching the fun, &quot;You don&#39;t know how much garbage will be here after the music festival is over. If I don&#39;t arrange for sanitation workers to clean here now, look, someone will come over and take pictures.&quot; The scene is so dirty, no one in the area cares about it anymore. Every day, people want to come here to dig up dirt on us, but no one sees the efforts we put in.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the voice of many locals. &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;A villager tried to explain to me the reason for the theft - &quot;This is the first time we have held a music festival, and everyone is not very clear about what it does; if the security work is extended for another half day That’s great, there are too many people and I can’t take care of them. And some music fans did say that they left and didn’t want their things.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Xiaobei feels that this cannot be solved by relying on security. &quot;Of course, the current security is not good enough, but even if a two-meter or five-meter-high wall is built, how many security guards are needed to keep an eye on everyone? Some of the harsh criticism online is too difficult and unrealistic for them.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;“No matter what music festival it is, losing things is a high probability.” Qiangchen once encountered a theft gang at a music festival he participated in in the past. “The number of mobile phones lost at that time was very large, and the total value was It may be similar to the loss of Midi this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Chang remembers that when he participated in the Suzhou Midi Music Festival in 2022, there were people who went to &quot;pick up trash&quot; at the end. One of her team members at the time dissuaded her and later became the team leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this music festival, a couple Liu Chang knew came all the way to take additional wedding photos. The two met on Midi a few years ago. She had a great time for four or five days, but when she returned to Beijing, her colleagues were asking her if she had lost anything. &quot;Everyone&#39;s last impression of the music festival is that of stealing. No one will think you played really well. There is a gray feeling.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 19, after many communications with volunteers, Liu Qifan I received 2,000 yuan in compensation, as well as souvenirs containing moon cakes, eye protection patches, towels, and a midi bracelet. “As someone who has experienced it, it’s hard to say whether I am satisfied or not.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the opening ceremony of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, the Director of Nanyang Culture, Radio, Television and Tourism Bureau once said, “Let the Midi Music Festival Taking root in Nanyang for ten years.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Nanyang Radio and Television, from September 29 to October 5, Nanyang received a total of 7.0987 million tourists and achieved tourism revenue of 2.899 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 1.944%. %, 33.29%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the scene, I asked an uncle who was cleaning up garbage: Do you still want to hold another music festival? He replied firmly, &quot;I still hope to do it, it will be beneficial.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiangchen confirmed to us that Midi and Nanyang will cooperate for a long time. “Next year (2024), we will still hold Midi Music in Nanyang.” Zhang Fan said in an interview with Nanyang Daily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Except Liu Chang, Chen Xiaobei, Qiang Chen, and Fangfang, the others are pseudonyms.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[叶刘淑仪： 多利用“软力量”向年轻人推广中国文化]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258804]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我国拟修订文物保护法完善文物保护制度措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258951]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/10/20/44b67d29aa7a29fc929c1efdfe094098.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;903&quot; height=&quot;1514&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/10/20/44b67d29aa7a29fc929c1efdfe094098.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254696&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural relics and cultural heritage are non-renewable and irreplaceable outstanding Chinese civilization resources. The current Cultural Relics Protection Law was promulgated in November 1982. It has been revised five times and was comprehensively revised in 2002.

The bottom line of the king&#39;s lack of morality is also eye-catching. This important vassal state in the early Zhou Dynasty that collected the remnants of the Yin Dynasty and lived in the ancient Shang Ruins in Heqijian, despite the warnings of Zhou Gong&#39;s three imperial edicts and the beginning of Kang Shu&#39;s good governance, for most of the subsequent time, fathers and sons killed each other and brothers died. The paragraph goes on and on, and Confucius&#39;s sentence &quot;You must also correct your name&quot; comes from it. Among them, the one most criticized by historians is the so-called Xuanjiang Rebellion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xuan Jiang is a famous beauty. She is the daughter of Duke Xi of Qi and the wife of Duke Xuang of Wei. The overlord Duke Huan of Qi is her brother, and the famous Lady Xu Mu is her daughter. She is regarded as a specimen of beauty&#39;s misfortunes. It is said that the five generations have been restless, and chaos started from Jiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duke Xuan of Wei had an affair with his concubine Yi Jiang and gave birth to his son Ji. Make him a prince and marry Qi&#39;s daughter for him. Before they got married, Duke Xuan heard that Qi&#39;s daughter was stunningly beautiful. He fell in love with her in a second and was so flirtatious that he immediately cut off her husband and took over the house without any worries, so that he could marry someone else for the prince. Qi Nu gave birth to sons Shou and Shuo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Yijiang committed suicide because he fell out of favor. The daughter of Qi, also known as Xuan Jiang, who became the first wife, and her son Shuo slandered Duke Xuan and framed the prince. Duke Xuan was dissatisfied, so he ordered the prince to go to Qi as an envoy and sent people to intercept and kill the prince on the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shou told the prince the truth and persuaded him to escape, but the prince refused because he could not violate his father&#39;s orders. So Shou took the crown prince&#39;s banner and went to be killed on his brother&#39;s behalf. The prince arrived shortly after and announced that he should kill me, but he was also killed. So Gongshuo was declared the crown prince. After the death of Duke Xuan, Shuo ascended the throne as Duke Hui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Hui Gong&#39;s family slandered the prince and replaced him, the Wei people were resentful, so they rebelled and made his younger brother Qian Mou the king. Hui Gong fled. Later, Duke Xiang of Qi led the princes to attack the guards on the king&#39;s order, Qian Mou fled, and Duke Hui was restored to power. Duke Xiang of Qi asked Xuan Jiang to remarry Ji&#39;s other brother Wan, and they gave birth to three sons and two daughters. However, the root of the slander has not been eliminated, and civil strife in Weiguo still occurs one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Placing blame for civil strife on women is a common tactic in traditional narratives. In fact, Jiang, who was in the vortex of scratching and superimposing, was also killed, which is enough to create another meaning of anxiety about appearance. Admittedly, the victim himself was not perfect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Book of Songs, which is called Si Wuxie, has many reflections on this incident, such as &quot;Xintai&quot;, &quot;Two Sons in a Boat&quot; and &quot;Wang Youci&quot;. &quot;The wall has thorns&quot; says:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wall has thorns and cannot be blocked. What you say in the middle is unreasonable. What can be said is ugly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wall has thorns and cannot support it. What Zhong Wei said cannot be specified. What can be described in detail is long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wall has thorns and cannot be restrained. The words in the middle are unreadable. It can be read, but it is insulting to say it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confucian scholar Zhu Xi said: Ci is also called tribulus. Sprawling, thin leaves, triangular seeds, stinging. Pharmacist Tao Hongjing described that it grows on roads and walls, with leaves spread all over the ground and seeds with thorns, shaped like rhombus but small. Chang&#39;an is the most affluent place, and many people walk with wooden shoes. Nowadays, the military is made of cast iron to cover the enemy&#39;s roads, and it is called iron caltrop. &quot;Book of Changes&quot; says &quot;according to tribulus&quot;, which means it can cause severe damage. &quot;Poetry&quot; says that &quot;the wall has thorns and cannot be blocked&quot;, which is used to stave off filth. The prescription is very rare. Li Shizhen explained from the perspective of sound training: Tribulus means disease; Quinoa means benefit; Ci means thorn. It hurts people very quickly and is very beneficial. Materia Medica also has names such as Qu Ren and Zhi Xing, which are all derived from its ability to hurt people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most common man in Chang&#39;an said that he had no choice but to wear wooden shoes for protection due to the proliferation of herbs. The caltrops made of cast iron bear witness to the early development of bionic weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shizhen’s analysis of Tribulus terrestris varieties: Tribulus terrestris leaves are like young honey locust leaves, neat and cute. Tribulus terrestris is shaped like red-rooted rapeseed and fine water chestnuts, with a triangle and four spines, and is actually a benevolent plant. The white Tribulus terrestris has pods that are about an inch long, with inner seeds as big as sesame seeds, shaped like sheep kidneys and tinged with green. People today call it Tribulus terrestris. Distinguish this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is mainly treated under the column, where the herbal medicine breaks the crux and accumulates, sore throat and breast difficulty. Taking it for a long time will build muscles, improve eyesight and lighten the body. It can be used to treat various wind ulcers, vomiting and pus, and remove dryness and heat. It induces abortion, and the woman&#39;s milk is released. Treats wind secretion and roundworm abdominal pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the prescription is rarely used, there are quite a few conveniences in the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to take: One stone of Tribulus terrestris seeds, collected when ripe in July and August, dried every day , pound it to remove the thorns, and pestle it to remove the thorns. Take two qian for each dose, mix it with fresh water, and take it three times a day. Do not let it die, and it will cut off the grain and lead to longevity. After taking it for one year, it will not be cold in winter or hot in summer. In two years, the old man has become younger again, his hair has turned white and black again, and his teeth have fallen out again. If you take it for three years, you will be light and live forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Induced labor: difficult labor, the fetus is in the abdomen, cannot be coated and the fetus dies. Take four liang each of Tribulus terrestris and Fritillaria as powder, and take three qian in rice soup. Do not take it for a while, then take it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ascaris heartache: vomiting water. On July 7th, pluck Tribulus terrestris seeds, dry them in the shade, and burn them into ashes. Eat them first and take Fang Cun Dagger three times a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirty years of blindness: Liver-tonifying powder: Harvest Tribulus terrestris on July 7th, dry in the shade and pound into powder. Take Fang Cun Dagger with water after meals, for two days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tooth shakes: pain and shock. Grind 5 qian of raw Tribulus terrestris into half a bowl of dilute water, dip it in water and add salt to warm it and rinse it, it is very effective. Or use the roots to burn the ashes, and the teeth will be firmly attached. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nasal congestion and watery discharge: I have not smelled any fragrance for many years. Take two handfuls of tribulus and boil half a cup of it with a large cup of water when a cart runs over it. Lie on your back, put rice in your mouth first, and pour the juice into your nose. If it is blocked and re-administered, one or two polyps appear like red chrysalis, which will heal immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scars on the face: combine Tribulus terrestris and Shantouzi into powder, mix with vinegar, and apply it at night to wash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vitiligo: 6 liang of Tribulus terrestris seeds, raw and pounded into powder, take 2 qian for each soup, twice a day. After one month, the roots will disappear, and after taking it for half a month, red spots will appear on the white areas, which is a miracle effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are not only the secrets of the gods that the winter will not be cold but the summer will not be hot, the old man will be reborn and his teeth will fall, the valley will be broken and the valley will be immortal, as well as the desperate and chronic disease of thirty years of blindness, as well as the emergency that prompts the birth of lower clothes, and more Shaking teeth, stuffy nose, and vitiligo are common and difficult diseases that are common in daily life. However, the prognosis of more effective or even miraculous effects, as well as the description of the situation described in the prescription, cannot be ruled out. Yun Er can present a mirrored ironing post. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[爱上长者饭堂的年轻人，图什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258867]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;Visit:&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Clean and hygienic prices are not expensive&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Elderly The canteen is popular among some young people&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The braised pork with pickled cabbage, stir-fried pork with cauliflower, green vegetables, corn and carrot soup... The reporter showed weekly items in the canteen of the Yikang Center on Tianhe South Street in Tianhe District. It can be seen from the menu that the canteen serves lunch and dinner from Monday to Sunday. Each meal is a fixed set meal of three dishes, one soup and one rice. It has a complete range of meat and vegetables and rich combinations. It also provides &quot;special meals&quot; for the elderly with special needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Tianhe District meal subsidy standards, seniors of different ages and household registration status can receive subsidies ranging from 3 yuan to 6 yuan on the basis of the original price of 13 yuan. The package price for the public is It&#39;s 14 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with ordinary restaurants, the elderly canteen mainly caters to the tastes of the elderly. It uses boiling, stewing, steaming and other methods to make the ingredients soft and easy to digest, and focuses on less salt, less oil and lower fat.
