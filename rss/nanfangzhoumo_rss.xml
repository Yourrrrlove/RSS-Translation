But in more than ten years of study experience, he found that his ideal is still to &quot;engage in academics and do research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating from the Journalism Department of Fudan University in 1968, the child soldiers were assigned to participate in labor training in Horqin, Inner Mongolia. In 1970, the &quot;Jintie News&quot; accidentally discovered their writing skills to become a journalist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The tide of the times is carrying budding journalism students drifting in unknown directions. In 1977, news came that the country had resumed the college entrance examination. The child soldiers who were far away from the border regained their fighting spirit to study, and the following year they were admitted to the postgraduate degree in the Chinese Department of Peking University. This year, a full ten years have passed since the child soldier graduated from college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;His mentor during his master&#39;s and doctoral studies was journalism educator Gan Xifen. Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Tong Bing devoted himself to the research of Marxist journalism concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Opening up a new research direction requires a lot of basic reading support. Within one year, Tong Bing read through more than 4,000 papers with the word &quot;horse&quot; in them, and also read through all 50 volumes of the complete works of Marx and Engels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The complete works of Marx and Engels were published in batches. After the first 39 volumes were read, the last 11 volumes were not published until 1985.&quot; Tong Bing said that at that time, the most complete new books could only be seen at the former Central Compilation and Translation Bureau. The child soldier who was still a &quot;poor student&quot; often brought two steamed buns and a cup of boiling water to read in the Translation and Compilation Bureau, sitting there all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating with his doctorate in 1988, Tong Bing stayed at Renmin University of China to take up a teaching position. In more than 40 years of research and teaching career, he has published more than 700 academic papers, published and edited more than 50 books, textbooks, dictionaries, etc., and successively published the &quot;History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot; and &quot;The History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot;. Academic monographs such as &quot;Classic Course of Marxist Journalism&quot;, &quot;Introduction to Theoretical Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Journalism Theory&quot;, &quot;Comparative Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Subject and Mouthpiece - An Examination of the Trajectory of News Communication in the Republic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This is how I have been through these years. It can be said that there is no time to breathe and no chance to sleep peacefully. I am constantly breaking through new tasks. Although it was tiring at the time, looking back now, I think it was worth it,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the first doctorate in journalism independently trained in China, Tong Bing has experienced the process of graduate education in journalism from scratch and witnessed the development of Renmin University of China, The development of journalism at Fudan University, one of the two famous universities in the north and the other in the south. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Do knowledge simply and plainly, but don&#39;t do simple learning&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t dare to waste a day in life&quot; are the creeds he mentioned many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Already octogenarian, Tong Bing is currently a senior professor of liberal arts at Fudan University, still standing on the three-foot podium teaching journalism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Truth&quot; is a key word for Tong Bing&#39;s academic studies. He once used the four &quot;truths&quot; of &quot;true learning, true understanding, true belief, and true application&quot; The words summarized his lifelong academic insights. His pursuit of truth in learning also allowed him to repeatedly speak out about the shortcomings of the journalism community and the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Journalism research has entered a new era. He directly stated the shortcomings of the development of the discipline, &quot;Among various disciplines, the discipline construction of journalism has developed slowly.&quot; In his It seems that in order to solve the development problems of journalism, &quot;it is necessary to calmly spread out the problems and conduct in-depth analysis. This may be good.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;My ideal is not here. Place&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; When taking the college entrance examination in 1963 , why did you apply for the Journalism Department of Fudan University? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; I wanted to be a reporter when I was in middle school. At that time, I was a student cadre and the president of the student union. I was no stranger to news. . Student cadres who want to take the liberal arts major usually choose the Department of Politics, the Department of International Politics, and the Department of Journalism. At that time, the universities with the best journalism departments in my country were Renmin University in the north and Fudan University in the south. My parents didn’t want me to leave Shanghai, so I took the Fudan exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong>;：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ span>;It took ten years between graduating from undergraduate degree and applying for graduate school. Can you talk about this experience? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; When I graduated from my undergraduate degree, it was at the end of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and I was assigned to participate in labor training in the Northeast. I started out as a road maintenance worker building railroads. At that time, all major railway bureaus in our country had enterprise newspapers, and Jinzhou Railway had an enterprise newspaper called &quot;Jintie News&quot;. More than half a year later, they found out about me and transferred me to the newspaper as an editor and reporter. The newspaper office often holds correspondent training classes. Since I major in journalism, I often give lectures and have a relatively harmonious relationship with everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After staying there for a while, our country resumed the college entrance examination. At first, the railway didn’t want to let me go because I had already graduated from my undergraduate degree. But later, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau heard that both Renmin University and Fudan University were recruiting master&#39;s degree students (there were no graduate students in the journalism major before) and agreed that I would try to take the exam. I passed the exam right away and was the first batch of master&#39;s students recruited in our country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Reform and opening up on your personal destiny What is the impact? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; The changes in my personal destiny are closely linked to reform and opening up. Sometimes I often say in meetings or classes that I am very grateful to Deng Xiaoping. If the college entrance examination and university admissions are not resumed, I may still be a reporter at the Jinzhou Railway Bureau tabloid for the rest of my life. If I do well, I may be promoted to deputy editor-in-chief or editor-in-chief. However, my ideal is not in this place. I still want to engage in academics and theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; During graduate school, Professor Gan was How did that guide you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; Mr. Gan Xifen is also recruiting graduate students for the first time, and his requirements for me are relatively strict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There were pilot projects before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, but they could not be carried out after a while, so there was no master&#39;s degree in journalism before 1978. The lifelong wish of these old gentlemen is to push forward journalism research. The National People&#39;s Congress and Fudan University were the first to do relevant work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mr. Gan Xifen emphasized two points when guiding me. The first point is to read the original works. He believes that graduate students in journalism should learn more classic works; the second point is to practice. I always insisted on these two points while studying at Renmin University, and I persisted relatively well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;How do you insist on these two points? required? What are the specific methods? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; I had classes during the day, read in the afternoon, and went to the journalism department office around 4 o&#39;clock to read the day&#39;s newspapers. , we poor students could not afford to subscribe to newspapers at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I come back from the classroom and library at 9pm, I review the day&#39;s newspapers in the dormitory, including the day&#39;s &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; and &quot;China Youth Daily&quot;. The review is conducted 5 nights a week, each person is responsible for one week, and several people take turns. The students responsible for reviewing the newspaper should take notes and write a report every week, which should be sent to the newspaper. The newspaper also attaches great importance to our opinions and will reply to us every once in a while. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This arrangement is very helpful to our study. After a 3-year master&#39;s degree, I stuck to this method for almost 3 years. We also have many contacts with news organizations and have a relatively close relationship. I did the same thing until I stayed in school to become a teacher after graduation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Continuously opening new courses and recruiting new students&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt; /strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;1&lt;/strong>;In 1983, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council agreed to establish a doctorate in journalism. Under the background of that time, if you graduate with a master&#39;s degree and work as a university teacher, your academic qualifications are enough. Why do you continue to study for a doctorate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Child Soldier:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;One is because of the need for theoretical study , studying for a doctoral degree will give you the opportunity to audit courses in many other majors at Renmin University. For example, I have listened to history, scientific socialism, and international politics. When I went to attend classes, none of the teachers refused. They saw that I was not too young and still eager to learn, so they generally allowed me to enter their classrooms, and I often asked questions in class. In this regard, they really treated me. Very considerate: When I go to ask questions after class, other teachers or classmates will stop and let me (ask questions first). In the process of my study, it can be said that many teachers from relevant majors at Renmin University have helped me a lot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, my supervisor and other teachers in the journalism department hope that I can take the lead in helping the school establish a doctoral program in journalism. Later, the State Education Commission agreed that journalism would have a doctoral degree. At that time, China began to have doctoral programs (in journalism), and two schools were approved, one was the Journalism Department of Fudan University, and the other was the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;After graduating from the Ph.D., you stayed He taught at the National People&#39;s Congress and returned to his alma mater, Fudan University, in 2001. What did you think at that time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>;After completing my master&#39;s degree at Renmin University, I stayed in school because of the needs of school work. At that time, our journalism industry was in great need of talents, and young people wanted to join it and go out into the society. But the instructor said something to me, which moved me very much. The Cultural Revolution delayed it for ten years, and they really wanted to restore our major as soon as possible, so they hoped that I could stay and teach in this school with peace of mind. Only by staying in this profession and being a good teacher can this profession continue to have new talents and new developments. I quickly accepted the arrangements in the school and worked hard. I have done a lot of pioneering work over the past few decades. It is very worthwhile when I think about it now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Moving from the National People&#39;s Congress to teaching at Fudan is also an adjustment arrangement for the school. At that time, Fudan was in great need of people. Compared with Renmin University, Fudan&#39;s development is more international. Many outstanding students have gone abroad after graduation. The teachers are getting older and their health is getting worse every year. We teachers and students know each other very well, and we see this situation with our eyes and are anxious in our hearts. Therefore, the school raised this expectation and hoped that we can come back to shoulder the heavy burden. I came back without saying anything. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the beginning, there was a lot of pressure and a heavy burden. Journalism was delayed for many years by the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and is in urgent need of development. The desire for talents is everywhere. So whether I stayed at the National People&#39;s Congress or was later called by Fudan University, I just taught with peace of mind, constantly opening new courses and recruiting new students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This has been the case for these years. It can be said that when there is no time to breathe, there is no chance to sleep peacefully. Although we were very tired at the time, we soon overcame these difficulties and continued to make new progress in our work. Looking back now, I still think it was worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Understand your mission”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt; /strong>;&lt;/span>;In your opinion, what is the overall shift in current journalism research and what are its deficiencies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>;Differences in theoretical viewpoints are inevitable, natural, and reasonable. (The development of journalism research) I think it ultimately depends on the progress of journalism practice. You are right to insist on your point of view. As a result, newspapers and radio and television have been successfully run. This shows that theory guides practice. On the other hand, if your theory is sound and sound, but no one reads your newspaper or listens to your broadcast, it shows that your theory has no power. Isn&#39;t this a problem? This is where we theorists feel ashamed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, there is still a strong culture of self-appreciation in the academic world, which should not be the case. The academic community should review this and analyze the reasons behind it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Journalism has always faced the &quot;news What do you think of the questioning and debate about &quot;no learning&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tongbing:&lt;/strong>; The &quot;no-learning theory&quot; has long-term influence on the development of journalism, mainly due to several circumstances. Journalism started relatively late, and there are not many independent scholarships and works. The aspect of journalism that has a deeper impact on China is practice. Running newspapers, radio stations, and television stations are all based on practical work. There are not many people who actually engage in theoretical research. Not big either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These understandings affect the status and image of journalism in various liberal arts majors. After we got PhDs, China&#39;s journalism research gradually got on the right track and started to have something decent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;How do you understand journalists Mission? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Child Soldier:&lt;/strong>; Journalists must understand their mission. The simplest and simplest requirement is to report the truth to the people. , real news, that’s the most important thing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Journalism Freshman Can you give some life advice to college students who have just entered school? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; This is a very broad proposition. I think the life development of college students is the same as the operation characteristics of our entire country. , one wave after another, one tide after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As teachers, we hope that the new students can inherit the good traditions of the school and develop them stronger, so that the university will become better and better, and the college students themselves will also become better and better. We can continue to make progress. Only in this way will our country become better and better and our career become more and more brilliant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So after college students enter university, the first thing is to understand their mission. Everyone should have their own arrangements and expectations. This is not just lip service, it is actually something that must be done. We all came slowly from undergraduate to master&#39;s and doctoral degrees. New students especially need to have a sense of mission and have expectations, prospects, and arrangements for the future. I think this is the most important thing. Time flies so fast. Even if you look at the four years of undergraduate studies, half of it has passed in the blink of an eye. However, the task is actually endless. We still need to continue to work hard, strive for, and develop in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;College students should not be afraid of being tired. Only by constantly exploring their own prospects can individuals have new goals, new directions, and continuous progress. Learn more every day, overcome your shortcomings, and show new expectations. This is my common expectation for our college students, whether they are undergraduates, masters, or doctoral students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 10:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“机场判官”再曝住宿骗局：虚假定位误导消费者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261538]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;July 5, 2020, Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport.

With the update of this series of videos, the Xi&#39;an transfer strategy that Liu Yi originally wanted to do has gradually evolved into a &quot;spy war drama&quot;. Netizens not only liked and followed it, but also continued to provide clues to Liu Yi. In Liu Yi&#39;s account (the account name is &quot;This is not too much&quot;), videos related to Xi&#39;an Airport have become &quot;top-rated&quot; content, and many of them have more than three million views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of November 20, Liu Yi once again released a video saying that hotels and B&amp;Bs around Xi&#39;an Airport posted false positioning on the OTA platform (online travel hotel platform) For hotel information, he searched these platforms for a B&amp;B several hundred meters away from the airport, and actually had to take a car there.

In the video released on November 20, Liu Yi deliberately took the high-speed train from Beijing to Xi&#39;an in order to avoid leaking his itinerary, and then took a bus to Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport to &quot;patrol&quot;, which confirmed that the positioning of B&amp;Bs around the airport on the OTA platform was fraudulent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this video, Liu Yi searched for the hotel with the closest straight line distance on a platform, and the first-ranked &quot;Jiaxuan Boutique B&amp;B&quot; was marked &quot;from Xianyang The international airport is 340 meters straight.&quot; In fact, the passenger arrived at the online car-hailing parking lot, which is the hotel pick-up location. Then he searched on another platform, and multiple Huangzhixiang Hotel branches appeared on the page, one of which was &quot;119 meters &quot;Straight-line distance from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport&quot;, but when I called, the other party told me that the hotel is behind the terminal and that I need to wait for the car to pick me up; finally, the Shitouji Inn, which was &quot;less than 100 meters away from you in a straight line&quot; on the third platform, was also falsely positioned. .

The hotel is actually more than 8 kilometers away from the airport. It is said to be an inn, but it is actually a room owned by farmers near the airport, and the sanitary rooms are extremely poor.&quot; Some netizens said that there are already tourists on the online platform Comments mentioned issues such as long distances and fake room pictures, but this type of B&amp;B still ranks high on the platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yi discovered that the above-mentioned B&amp;Bs were falsely positioned at the online car-hailing parking lot, T3 terminal, and T2 terminal of Xi&#39;an Airport. According to the information he collected, these B&amp;Bs are basically run by villagers from Bianfang Village and Shitou Village near the airport. Because they are close to the airport, these villages have developed a transit accommodation industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 22, Southern Weekend reporters searched on Ctrip, Tongcheng, Fliggy and other platforms, and only &quot;near Xi&#39;an Xianyang International&quot; was displayed in the hotel list. Airport&quot; but does not show the specific distance. Then type in the search for the three falsely positioned B&amp;Bs mentioned in Liu Yi&#39;s video. The Ctrip platform has removed all three stores; however, some platforms can still search for Jiaxuan Boutique Apartment, which shows that it is sold out and cannot be pre-ordered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The address page of Fliggy Search Jiaxuan Business Hotel is still marked &quot;About 300 meters west of Terminal T2 of Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport&quot;.

On another OTA platform, a store that was marked on the 20th as &quot;less than 100 meters away from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport in a straight line, about a 1-minute walk&quot; was modified on the 22nd to &quot;4.5 kilometers from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport by car, about 9 minutes.&quot; When a reporter from Southern Weekend asked why it was only a one-minute walk away, the store owner did not reply directly, but emphasized that &quot;I am outside the airport, and there is no way it is as cheap as ours inside the airport.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 22, Southern Weekend reporters contacted four OTA platforms, Ctrip, Tongcheng, Fliggy and Meituan, but received no reply. An industry insider on the OTA platform who did not want to be named analyzed that the platform needs to verify the address of the hotel before it goes online, and also conducts daily verification and inspections after going online. The current listings with false addresses should be due to the operators providing fake business operations. For example, the address on the license or lease contract is the same as the online address, so it is difficult for the platform to identify it. At the same time, various online travel and hotel platforms still have some agent listings, and some listings are closed on one platform and re-listed on other platforms. &quot;If the platform does not effectively intercept, it will be difficult to investigate and deal with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the above-mentioned Airport New City told Southern Weekend reporters that the local market supervision department has interviewed three OTA platforms in the past two days and ordered them to strengthen the management of homestays around the airport. Information review. Offline, the joint law enforcement team they formed also conducted focused investigations on several issues mentioned by the blogger, including whether the names on the special industry license, business license, and door plaque were consistent, and whether the pictures on the platform were consistent with the actual situation. etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Dilemma of Passengers’ Rights Protection&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A few days after Liu Yi released the video, netizens left messages one after another, talking about their travels in Xiamen, Kunming, Dali, Airports in Shanghai have also encountered similar problems, but there are not many people who choose &quot;hard&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Netizen Zhang Ning landed on Fuzhou Airport on September 4th.

Zhang Ning and the hotel&#39;s front desk theory, why the hotel location and photos are different from the platform. The other party said, &quot;That&#39;s an old shop, it has been closed&quot;, and does not provide specific addresses, letting her take a taxi. At that time, it was late at night. Zhang Ning could only live after weighing again and again, and asked the pick -up personnel to return her back to the airport the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;I originally wanted to give a bad review, but because he had my personal information and dare not give it.&quot; Zhang Ning said that she was worried about being retaliated and did not want to give herself.

These are the common themes in Ren Bo Nian. He is a character he repeatedly described. The Zhong Rong he painted is particularly chic, high -vision, but it looks like an unruly. Whenever these new works are made in these strange works, you can see the painter&#39;s true temperament and humor. He painted flowers and birds, and the fat birds with big white eyes came from the eight major mountains, but the strange rise of the eight major became happy in Ren Bonian.

Image source: Pinduoduo Weibo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 28, 2023, Beijing time, Pinduoduo’s intraday trading repeatedly hit new highs, rising by more than 18%. Within fifteen minutes, the market value increased by $100 million. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the opening to the closing, Pinduoduo’s total market value soared from US$156.4 billion to US$184.7 billion, a surge of nearly 30 billion. As of the close, Pinduoduo was only tens of billions away from Alibaba, which has a market capitalization of US$195.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If compared according to the price limit rules of China&#39;s A-share market, Pinduoduo is only one &quot;price limit&quot; away from Alibaba. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s rapid rise has triggered heated discussions among investors. Some people lamented that the throne of e-commerce is about to change hands and that &quot;an era of great things is coming&quot;, while others joked that &quot;the higher the stock price rises, the poorer everyone becomes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fierce reaction of the capital market stems from Pinduoduo’s outstanding performance in the third quarter of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 28, Pinduoduo (PDD.Nasdaq) released its financial report for the third quarter of 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;financial report&quot;), with revenue of 68.84 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 94%, not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP), net profit attributable to Pinduoduo’s ordinary shareholders was 17.027 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 37%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We can clearly feel the continued recovery of the economy, as well as the potential and resilience of the consumer market. At the same time, we also see from user behavior that consumption upgrades are both about quality and price. The optimization of price-performance ratio is consumers&#39; ultimate pursuit of good products at good prices.&quot; said Chen Lei, Chairman and Co-CEO of Pinduoduo Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reviewing Pinduoduo’s past financial reports, it achieved (Non-GAAP) quarterly profit for the first time in the third quarter of 2020, a year-on-year increase of 89%. Since then, although revenue has doubled on average every quarter, it was not until the second quarter of 2021 that Pinduoduo achieved double growth in revenue and net profit in a single quarter for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to now, Pinduoduo has drawn a significant upward curve of revenue growth and net profit doubling for two consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Buy a lot of groceries, a hidden revenue tool&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei attributed the revenue growth to the improvement of the consumer environment and the implementation of the company&#39;s &quot;high-quality development&quot; strategy. Judging from the financial report, Pinduoduo’s 94% revenue growth was due to the double increase in revenue from its two main businesses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Online marketing services and other services increased by 39% year-on-year, and transaction service revenue increased by as much as 315% year-on-year. The two account for about half of the total revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What supports the growth of transaction service revenue is generally an increase in the number of active merchants on the platform and an increase in the average transaction service revenue of each active merchant (i.e. commission). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter learned from a Pinduoduo merchant that the transaction commission is charged based on the sales price of the completed order, and the commission will not be refunded if the consumer returns the product. Pinduoduo did not release GMV (gross merchandise transaction) data in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Lichong, President of Huisheng International Capital, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that transaction service fees actually include the income of Duoduo Maicai. This quarter’s unexpected growth is due to the rapid expansion of Duoduo Maicai. Huang Lichong once served as executive director and managing director of the investment banking department of China International Finance Securities (Hong Kong). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduomaicai was launched in August 2020. Since then, Pinduoduo’s transaction service fee income has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei commented at the 2020 third quarter earnings conference call that Duoduo’s grocery shopping business is “a platform that consumers use very frequently.” Entering the fourth quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s number of active buyers surpassed Alibaba for the first time, reaching 788 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment, Duoduomaicai has gone through many rounds of fierce battles between platforms and has survived the dark moment of community group buying. According to reports from many media including Qilu Evening News, nine provinces have been shut down in order to target the prosperity of the sinking market. Jingxi Pinpin is only left in Langfang, Hebei and Beijing. Other community group buying has also been shut down one after another. Currently, Pinduoduo and Meituan Each controls half of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2023, the US asset management company HAYDEN CAPITAL estimated that by 2025, Duoduo Maicai will contribute at least about 14 billion yuan in EBIT to Pinduoduo, which may start in 2023 Achieve overall profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial performance meeting, Chen Lei introduced that Pinduoduo started out in agricultural products and retained a number of users through agricultural products services. However, the current online rate of this category is low, and there is huge potential in the future. potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Duoduo’s grocery shopping, the market generally speculates that Duoduo’s cross-border services may create a new revenue growth curve for Pinduoduo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, Pinduoduo launched the cross-border e-commerce project Temu, which Chen Lei regarded as his &quot;third venture.&quot; At that time, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance, Liu Jun, said that cross-border business was in its early stages and would have little impact on financial reports. Temu’s revenue data was not announced in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduo’s cross-border project is led by Gu Pingping, the former head of Duoduo’s grocery shopping, and inherits Pinduoduo’s domestic supply, talent, and marketing advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial report meeting, Liu Jun said, &quot;Pinduoduo&#39;s global business is still in a very early stage, and the team is still increasing its understanding of consumer needs in different markets around the world.&quot; Currently, Temu has launched a In 2016, it has expanded to 40 countries and regions around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Getting out of the quagmire of losses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 28, in contrast to the upward trend in Pinduoduo’s stock price, the stock price of Alibaba (BABA.NYSE) dropped all the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumption downgrading is an increasingly clear trend. Consumers are moving from platforms with high unit prices to low-price platforms. Low price is still the key for Pinduoduo to occupy the sinking market in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at Pinduoduo’s growth history, the “10 billion subsidy” strategy has not only opened up the market for it, but is also the main reason for dragging down its financial performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo has faced significant losses since its listing. From 2018 to the first quarter of 2020, losses continued to expand. In June 2019, after the &quot;Ten Billion Subsidy&quot; was launched, it achieved GMV growth and increased user activity. The price was that its sales and marketing expenses exceeded profits, which was equivalent to all the revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the second quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s losses have narrowed. Ma Jing, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance at the time, said at the earnings conference call, “Profitability will not be considered this year.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the third quarter of 2020 that Pinduoduo achieved profitability for the first time, which was also when CEO Chen Lei took office. The first report card after. This year, Pinduoduo launched Duoduo’s grocery shopping business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo really &quot;taken off&quot; in the second quarter of 2021, with both revenue and profit increasing, and getting out of the mire of losses. Since then, it has almost maintained a double-digit profit growth. In particular, three quarters in 2022 will achieve multiple growth, with profits in the second quarter nearly tripling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jing responded at the second quarter 2021 conference call that revenue growth stems from the increase in the number of users and the increase in user psychological share, and the second quarter is the off-season for marketing, so marketing expenditures are small and there are seasonal factors. Special reasons for sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Pinduoduo executives also made no secret of the fact that the increase in profits comes from cost reduction and efficiency increase during the 2021 financial results conference call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Lichong said that over the years, Pinduoduo has optimized its operating costs, reduced some unnecessary expenses, increased profit margins by increasing product prices and reducing after-sales service costs, while investing in technology, logistics, agriculture and other fields. , improve its own competitiveness and business efficiency. These strategies have effectively helped it get out of losses and achieve profits beyond expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s executive director and co-CEO Zhao Jiazhen revealed in a recent earnings conference call that during the just past “Double Eleven” promotion, the number of users of Pinduoduo’s “10 billion subsidy” has exceeded 620 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the first trading day after the financial report was released, employees on Alibaba’s intranet discussed Pinduoduo’s performance in the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba partner Jack Ma rarely replied, &quot;All great companies are born in winter. The era of AI e-commerce has just begun, and it is both an opportunity and a challenge for everyone. I would like to congratulate Pinduoduo for the past few years. Decision-making, execution and efforts. No one is better, but those who can reform for the sake of tomorrow and the organization that are willing to pay any price and sacrifice are respected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戏骨云集的《风声》姐妹篇，砸了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261518]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The new theatrical film &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; is the latest version of &quot;The Wind&quot; &quot;Sister volume of &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also an original work by Mai Jia + director Gao Qunshu, with a spy war theme + a bone drama, but the reputation is far different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1511&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259921&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Today, 14 years after its release, &quot;The Wind&quot; is still the leading Chinese-language spy suspense film. 600,000 people gave it a high score of 8.4 on Douban, which is better than 95% of dramas and 98% of thrillers.

This shows that joint-stock banks are weak in green loans to support the development of green industries. At the same time, joint-stock banks rarely issue green bonds, and the average size of green bond underwriting is only about 1/10 of large state-owned banks, which also shows that joint-stock banks are weak in green financial products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are not no benchmarks among joint-stock banks.

Among them, carbon emission scope three data is an important part of carbon emission accounting at the organizational level, including greenhouse gas emissions from upstream and downstream (value chain) activities related to corporate production. For service industries such as finance, business travel and employee commuting are the main components of Scope 3. However, due to greater accounting difficulties in this part, fewer life insurance companies proactively disclose it. In addition, although the insurance industry has paid more attention to ESG reporting, most ESG reports have not obtained third-party certification, so their objectivity and independence are questionable. Based on the above reasons and from the perspective of encouraging standardized information disclosure, corporate governance dimension indicators are set in a qualitative manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Life insurance list: Ping An Life takes the lead&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Life insurance According to the green finance list of industrial financial institutions, Ping An Life, PICC Life and Sunshine Life ranked among the top three in total. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the perspective of quantitative and qualitative indicators, Ping An Life, PICC Life and AIA Life are leading, but PICC Life and AIA Life failed to provide any supplementary information in time during the survey. , so the media factor score is 0, which drags down the total score and ranking. It is worth noting that because Taikang Life is not listed and has not disclosed an ESG report or social responsibility report, its quantitative and qualitative indicators rank at the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Green Finance List - Life Insurance List (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29 /81322a3209.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1203&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/81322a3209.png&quot; data -key=&quot;259953&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Green Finance List Life Insurance List (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;China Life ranks first in economic performance&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, and &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Sunshine Life has the highest social performance score&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to find advantages and differences and set a benchmark for the insurance industry, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center focused on analyzing the green financial measures taken by the top three life insurance companies in each dimension, with a view to It provides a useful reference for enterprises to achieve green transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the perspective of economic performance, China Life, China Pacific Insurance and Ping An Life ranked among the top three.

During the same period, among the surveyed companies in mainland my country and Hong Kong, only 37% and 52% conducted some degree of assurance in 2021.

The former refers to the fact that Hengdian Film and Television Base is now dominated by the &quot;vertical screen short drama&quot; shooting team; the latter refers to the short drama application platform ReelShort, which has begun to conquer overseas markets and even topped the U.S. iOS entertainment list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22, the &quot;2023-2024 China Micro-Short Drama Market Research Report&quot; released by iiMedia Consulting showed that China&#39;s online short drama market size will be 37.39 billion yuan in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 267.65%. A total of 481 new short dramas were released in the first half of 2023, exceeding the level for the whole of 2022. It is estimated that the size of China&#39;s short drama market will reach 100.68 billion yuan in 2027. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rise of short videos has not only reshaped the audio-visual habits of netizens, but also accommodated netizens’ search, shopping, entertainment, and social needs: from search engines to short video platforms, from TV series to Switching to short dramas, switching from playing online games to watching short videos, switching from e-commerce shopping to live streaming... &quot;Short Video+&quot; is profoundly affecting the ecology of the Internet industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, various major Internet platforms have derived new business models of &quot;short video + advertising&quot; and &quot;short video + e-commerce&quot;, which have greatly subverted the traditional profit model: ByteDance recently announced the contraction of its gaming business, Short videos are fully embraced; the time spent watching short videos by netizens has exceeded the time spent on online games; traditional online writers are rushing into new tracks; major film and television bases have turned into &quot;vertical screen versions&quot;... These phenomena show that the short video era has created a new era of short videos. The rise of the drama has also profoundly changed the overall ecology of the upstream and downstream industrial chains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2023 China Online Audiovisual Development Research Report&quot; shows that among the 1 billion short video users in 2022, about 50.4% of users have watched short dramas within 3 minutes. The size of the short drama market in 2023 will almost reach half of the national movie box office, creating many traffic miracles and myths of sudden wealth. For example, in September 2023, the traffic miracle of &quot;Wushuang&quot; exceeded 100 million in revenue in 8 days, which caused a sensation. , the myth of getting rich &quot;completed in one week, released in one month, and achieving financial freedom&quot; is also widely circulated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The success of short plays is rooted in human nature, which is a deep need that people cannot erase. Human nature naturally loves &quot;refreshment&quot;, &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;relief&quot;, seeks emotional catharsis, and longs for emotional compensation. While the audience scolded the stereotyped short drama, they still couldn&#39;t help but finish watching a short drama with dozens of episodes before going to bed and experiencing the excitement of &quot;it turns out that success and love can come so quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short plays can often satisfy people&#39;s certain &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; the inherent pleasure mechanism of human nature. Themes such as &quot;Grand grudges between wealthy families&quot;, &quot;Marriage first, love later&quot; and &quot;The domineering president fell in love with me&quot; are everlasting. Revenge, counterattack, the boss&#39;s sweet pet, a golden son-in-law, marrying into a wealthy family... Such plots are also repeated many times. Can&#39;t get tired of watching it. The protagonist of the short drama has either become an alternative Count of Monte Cristo, or a film and television version of &quot;Long Aotian&quot; or &quot;Mary Sue&quot;, or it seems to be the product of pressing shortcut keys on a long and drawn-out urban emotional drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slightly different from the previous Internet ecology, the current industry supervision has become more and more synchronized, which is a new situation worthy of attention. The recent news that &quot;Tik Tok, Kuaishou, and WeChat platforms are jointly cracking down on illegal short dramas&quot; is also consistent with the fact that the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has &quot;already removed 25,000 short dramas from the shelves. The next step will be to launch a one-month special rectification work on online short dramas.&quot; ” echoed the announcement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the Internet industry has indeed been &quot;leading the way for three to five years.&quot; Past success may not be maintained for a long time in the face of new trends. The rise of short dramas with the help of short videos fully illustrates this point. At the same time, the &quot;reckless state&quot; of the Internet industry&#39;s barbaric growth and turf racing has passed, and the advancement of technology and industry and the follow-up of regulatory regulations are increasingly showing a &quot;same frequency&quot; state. In compliance with regulatory requirements, the pursuit of high-quality and high-quality content will still be the main focus of the short drama market in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[七百岁村庙的“一生”：东南最早元代建筑被发现]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261520]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/29/9cbb99999f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 29/9cbb99999f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259937&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Overlooking Fook Sin Hall. Photographed by “Anonymous”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since I first saw Fook Sin Tong in 2017, I have never forgotten it. &quot;No name for now&quot; is his online name, and acquaintances call him &quot;No name for now.&quot; Even if the discovery of a Yuan Dynasty wooden building in the south was enough for him to leave his name in the history of architecture, he decided not to leave his name for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walk around the mountains and rivers of Fujian for a while, just like visiting old friends, to look for the historical buildings hidden deep in the ancient villages and scattered along the ancient roads. His &quot;discovery&quot; of Fu Shan Tang was accidental, or it might be inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fushan Hall is located in Zhengwei Village, Dikou Town, Jianou City, Fujian Province. It is a group of vernacular temple buildings, which conforms to the usual orientation rules of Chinese architecture: &quot;sitting Different from &quot;north to south&quot;, Fushan Hall conforms to the mountainous terrain of Zhengwei Village and faces south as a whole. The main hall is dedicated to the Three Treasures, and the left and right side halls are dedicated to Guanyin and King Dongping. It is a blend of Buddhism, Taoism and folk beliefs that are common in village temples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The main hall faces a Qing Dynasty stage across the courtyard, and is integrated with the main hall through the corridor. Before the main hall was confirmed as a Yuan structure, the stage was the narrative center of the entire building complex. When people in the village talked about Fu Shan Tang, they would always talk about the story of the stage, but they were completely unaware of the main hall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;discovery&quot; of Fu Shan Tang was not to find the existence of this building, but to confirm its identity as being built in the Yuan Dynasty. This time is July 18, 2023. That day, Liu Yan witnessed a &quot;highlight moment&quot; that has yet to come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yanhe has traveled almost all over the landscapes of southern Zhejiang and northern Fujian for more than ten years. He studies woven wooden arcade bridges. An amazing bridge structure unique to the Fujian and Zhejiang mountains. The same interests led him to meet each other very early on, and they have been online friends for seven or eight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhengweicun not only has Fushan Hall, but also has two covered bridges from the Qing Dynasty. In July 2023, Liu Yan took graduate students to survey and map in Zhengweicun Covered Bridge, I didn’t hear that they were in Fujian yet, so I drove here from Fuzhou, holding a newly purchased infrared camera in my hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hundreds of years of burning paper and smoke, the beams of the main hall of Fu Shan Tang have been smoked black by the incense of believers. The inscriptions written by the ancients on the beams It is impossible to find it and can only be roughly dated based on its style. Using an infrared camera, it is possible to see traces of writing beneath the smoke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e9396e852.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1272&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e9396e852.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259938&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 2023, instead of standing on the ladder, use an extended pole to connect the shooting instrument to observe the details of the components on the beams of Fushan Hall. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to preliminary observations, the main structure of Fushantang Hall is relatively complete, with shuttle columns, column foundations, humps, and replacement wood etc. The obvious early features, such as the planar column network and frame beams, are quite similar to the main hall of Shunchang Baoshan Temple built in the 23rd year of Yuan Zhizheng (1363) with a stone imitation wood structure. Through rough dating of style, it is not possible to judge that the structure of Fushan Hall is no later than the early Ming Dynasty, and may even be in the Yuan Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On that day, Liu Yan was not taken into Fushan Hall for the time being. While Liu Yan was still looking at the entire courtyard with unfamiliar eyes, he had already gone straight to the point and raised his infrared camera to identify the ink characters on Zhengliang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At first, Liu Yan didn&#39;t know what he saw through the infrared camera, because his expression didn&#39;t change much. He just raised his head to take a picture, and then lowered his head to confirm... Suddenly, he stopped getting excited. He held his breath, got excited, calmed down again, quickly checked on his mobile phone, and cautiously confirmed again. He no longer suppressed the ecstasy in his heart: &quot;Yuan Dynasty! The greatest!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The inscription on the main beam shown in the infrared camera clearly reads: &quot;On the ninth day of the eighth month of Wushen, the first year of Wei Zhi&#39;s reign, Yiwei came to Fucheng... Congratulations for the reconstruction of the city...&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 25, 2023, the UNESCO Representative Office in China and relevant government agencies of Fujian Province and Quanzhou City hosted the &quot;East Asian Wood Structure Building Protection and &quot;Utilizing International Academic Exchange Conference&quot;, at which Lou Jianlong, deputy director of Fujian Museum, gave a speech entitled &quot;Early Architecture and Characteristics of Fujian&quot;. During his speech, Lou Jianlong mentioned Fu Shan Tang. This may be the first time that Fu Shan Tang has been officially recognized as a newly discovered Yuan Dynasty building and mentioned at an international conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The existing main structure of Fushan Hall was founded in the first year of the Great Rebellion, that is, 1307. Before it, the earliest known Yuan Dynasty wooden structure in southeastern China was the Yanfu Temple in Wuyi, Zhejiang, built in 1317, the fourth year of Yanyou in the Yuan Dynasty. The newly confirmed Fushan Hall in Zhengwei Village has now become the earliest Yuan structure in the southeast. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cheng - the &quot;hedge&quot; of two time differences&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhengwei Village, where Fushan Hall is located, is located among the mountains in northern Fujian middle. The ancestor of the Zheng family who came to the village was Zheng Hao from the Song Dynasty. Zheng Fawang, secretary of the village branch, took out a photocopy of the &quot;Genealogy of the Zheng Family&quot; compiled during the Wanli Period of the Ming Dynasty, which recorded the story of the Zheng family&#39;s entry into Fujian and their reproduction in Jianzhou. The first ancestor of this Zheng family to migrate to Fujian was Zheng Shu during the Five Dynasties period. By Zheng Hao, it was already the eighth generation. According to the genealogy, Zheng Hao decided to move here after taking a fancy to the Feng Shui of Zhengwei Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walking around the village, even a person who doesn&#39;t understand Feng Shui can easily see that the terrain of this village is indeed a bit special. Surrounded by two mountains like an armchair, the village &quot;sits&quot; safely in the mountain col between the two armrests. The opening of the armchair faces north, and a small stream flows through the entrance of the village, blocking the village in the mountain col. Fu Shan Tang is located in the west of the village - at the foot of the west armrest of the &quot;armchair&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fdd66b33c4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fdd66b33c4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259939&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Looking northeast from Fushan Hall, Zhengwei Village has a panoramic view. Under the setting sun, the rammed earth walls of folk houses in northern Fujian turn golden. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although the old people in the village do not understand architecture, they have passed down from generation to generation that Fushan Hall was built by a man named Zhang Fushan in the Song Dynasty. Before Zheng came to the village, the main families in the village were Zhang and Wei. I don’t think this legend is likely to be an attachment, but Fushan Hall was probably built in the Song Dynasty, because the inscription mentions “reconstruction”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2021, Zhou Miao met Fu Shan Tang for the first time. He stayed there for a long time, &quot;it was really beyond imagination,&quot; he recalled his feelings at that time to the Southern Weekend reporter. He is a young teacher in the Department of Architecture of Zhejiang City University and is fond of ancient dwellings in northern Fujian and southern Zhejiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liang Sicheng, in &quot;The History of Chinese Architecture in Pictures&quot;, described the three periods of existing ancient architecture in China from the perspective of the history of artistic styles. The architecture of the Tang Dynasty was &quot;grand. &quot;Jing&quot; became &quot;mellow&quot; from the Song and Yuan Dynasties to the early Ming Dynasty, and &quot;straight&quot; during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Zhou Miao&#39;s research focuses on the transformation of architecture in the Tang and Song Dynasties. When he saw Fushan Hall, his professional intuition told him that the combination of columns, beams, and brackets had a &quot;Song style&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this era, to be able to find a metastructure in the humid south is a rare thing for any architectural scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the field of ancient architecture, there is a saying that &quot;Look to Shanxi in the north and Fujian in the south.&quot; The quantity, quality and density of preserved ancient buildings in these two provinces are far behind. more than other provinces. But Fujian is more unique than Shanxi. &quot;Shanxi is close to the Central Plains and the capitals of past dynasties, and the overall evolution of architecture has been relatively synchronized with the Central Plains dynasties. Maybe some styles have changed in the Central Plains, and Shanxi will also change in about 50 years.&quot; But Fujian is different, especially in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian and southern Zhejiang. , the development of architecture lags behind. If we see a style from the Song Dynasty there, it may be as late as the early Ming Dynasty. &quot;So when we see a house in Fujian with a fairly old style, we dare not make a judgment.&quot; Zhou Miao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Jian&#39;ou, located in the upper reaches of the Min River, is a mountainous area, but it was the first area in Fujian to be developed by Han immigrants. In 206 AD, the Sun Wu regime established Jian&#39;an County, the first county-level administrative region in Fujian history, in today&#39;s Jianou. Until the Song Dynasty, Jianzhou, centered on Jianou, was the cultural center of Fujian. At that time, Jianban books were popular all over the world, and Zhu Xi&#39;s Neo-Confucianism was also nurtured here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Miao later realized that although the mountainous areas of northern Fujian further north were developed very late, the narrow valley area in the upper reaches of the Min River was not too late. Specific to the style of architecture, there may also be a &quot;time difference&quot; between the Jian&#39;ou area and other northern Fujian areas. This time difference &quot;hedges&quot; the time difference between northern Fujian and the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Weird power confuses the gods,&quot; Liu Yan said, pointing to the intricately carved cat beams and dou bao on the beams of Fushan Hall. Based on this intuition, he also boldly speculated that Fushan Hall was built in the Yuan Dynasty. &quot;It feels like it is earlier than the Ming Dynasty, but it is unlikely to be in the Song Dynasty. Because both the Song and Ming Dynasties tend to be orthodox and regular. Only the buildings of the Yuan Dynasty can have this kind of unconventional and unconventional style.&quot; Weird and weird approach.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a94ef1b375.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a94ef1b375.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259940&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The beams of Fushan Hall are carved with complicated and strange cat beams and fighting arms. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I will not write my discovery into a public account article for the time being. After posting it, I refused all media interviews, &quot; He feels that he has completed his historical mission,&quot; Liu Yan said. In October 2023, Liu Yan completed the surveying and mapping task of the covered bridge project. Before returning to his workplace, Kunming University of Science and Technology, he decided to go to Fushan Hall again to conduct the first surveying and mapping of it. &quot;Do you want to come? Maybe you will come for the time being. We may be able to persuade him to accept an interview.&quot; He asked the Southern Weekend reporter. At the end of October, Southern Weekend reporters met Fu Shan Tang and its discoverer, and also watched Liu Yan&#39;s team conduct a brief survey and mapping of Fu Shan Tang. What impressed me deeply was not only the building itself, but also the people who were bound by Fuk Sen Tang. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Living - &quot;Growth&quot; in the eyes of architectural archeology&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Witnessing the discovery of Fushantang with her own eyes made Liu Yan feel that there was a kind of destiny The fate is inside. He is currently writing a series of studies on buildings &quot;sitting south and facing north&quot;. This architectural form that &quot;conflicts&quot; with the norm fascinates him. Fushantang appeared at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yan studied for a PhD in &quot;Architectural Archeology&quot; in Germany, and &quot;fine surveying&quot; is the core tool in this field. For a large building, complete architectural archeology may take several years, even decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Germany, where Liu Yan studied, precision surveying and mapping is a &quot;basic plan&quot; for carrying out cultural preservation work. &quot;There are no levels of cultural preservation in Germany. As long as it is cultural preservation, it is necessary to do such a complete and in-depth survey and mapping.&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A scholar of architectural archeology may not be able to do a few cases of precise surveying and mapping in his lifetime. Liu Yan&#39;s German mentor spent thirty years of his energy on a church. For the country, “this set of things is too luxurious. There are only a handful of cases across the country that can achieve the depth of architectural archeology through precise surveying and mapping. In Fujian, even the Luoyuan and Chen Taiwei Palace built in the Song Dynasty may not have been built yet.” Do enough mapping to match his identity,&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Architectural archeology is an emerging discipline in China. Liu Yan vividly described archeology as digging down layer by layer, &quot;and their strata are spread horizontally.&quot; Architectural archeology discussed the overlapping historical layers in above-ground buildings. For example, a Song Dynasty building was replaced in the Ming Dynasty. A certain component, a corridor was added in the Qing Dynasty... Just like archeology, there are also &quot;strata&quot; layer by layer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/6c5fd28f5c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/6c5fd28f5c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259941&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The interior of the main hall of Fuxiantang. Photo courtesy/&quot;No name for now&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Miao described Fushan Hall as a &quot;growing&quot; building: &quot;Obviously, it was expanded and expanded in different periods. Renovated.&quot; At the scene, Southern Weekend reporters were not given a detailed explanation of this development: there is an inscription from the Hongzhi Year of the Ming Dynasty under the purlin in the front of the main hall, an inscription from the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty under the porch, and an inscription from the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty in the side hall. , the stage shows the style of the late Qing Dynasty. The main hall itself contains different components and structures from the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, not to mention the rich &quot;strata&quot; overlapping of the entire building complex. &quot;Using &#39;Yuan to Qing&#39; to describe the age of Fushan Hall is more accurate and closer to the essence of architectural heritage.&quot; I don&#39;t think so yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yan said that architectural archeology is &quot;architectural detective science.&quot; Through comprehensive collection of on-site clues, architects can find subtle changes in buildings in the river of time, thereby inferring social and personnel changes in the past dynasties. This is what he wants to do to Fuxiantang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;What the early Architecture Society did was architectural archeology, but at that time the focus of scholars&#39; work was still to find the earliest buildings, and to find Tang Gou structures. , Looking for Song Gou, I can’t wait to peel off all the historical coverage of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.” Liu Yan said. The main hall of Hualin Temple in Fuzhou is such a classic representative. &quot;The original survey map did not even record the Qing Dynasty corridor. During the restoration and repair, the Qing Dynasty corridor was directly demolished.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today&#39;s architectural archeology is different from the pursuits of early scholars. On the one hand, it pursues more detailed surveying and mapping, and on the other hand, it pays more attention to the &quot;life story&quot; of a building - the completeness of a building. The life narrative of a city not only focuses on its &quot;first construction&quot; or &quot;original&quot; youthful and heroic appearance, but also understands its changes through the ages and its life state until its twilight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To understand the &quot;growth&quot; of Fu Shan Tang, we must not only start with the building itself, but also the historical environment where the building is located is also a key factor. Before the road was opened, the only way to enter and exit Zhengwei Village was through an ancient post road across a mountain stream. The ancient post road was connected to covered bridges. There was a covered bridge, Xian&#39;en Bridge, at the entrance of the village, and a covered bridge, Desheng Bridge, at the end of the village. The two covered bridges marked the entrance. The only access to the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The ancient post road was paved with wide stone slabs. &quot;The ancient road was so wide, it can be seen that the village itself had financial resources in ancient times.&quot; Liu Yan speculated. There are two more covered bridges next to the village. &quot;Those who have the ability to build covered bridges must be because the village is located on an important passage. It may be an important trade route in ancient times. People must pass through here to have the motivation to build it.&quot; Such a large covered bridge.&quot; Zhou Miao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What surprised Zhou Miao even more was the Ming Dynasty residences in Zhengwei Village. &quot;It is already a great thing to have Ming Dynasty residences in a village, and Zhengwei Village There may be more than five or six Ming Dynasty residences, and there are also many exquisite Qing Dynasty residences, which shows that this village has been prosperous for a long time. Its population reproduction and wealth accumulation must far exceed that of other surrounding villages.&quot; The accumulation of wealth has made Fushantang Large-scale reconstruction was carried out in the Yuan Dynasty, and during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there was the possibility of continuous growth, with side halls, corridors, and stages...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/bf8914da2f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1188&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/bf8914da2f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259942&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;福There is a stone tablet next to the entrance of the charity hall, which is engraved with the &quot;Yicang Stele&quot; written in the 50th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign. It has a chronicle on the front and a name on the back. According to this monument, there was originally a Mingjiao temple not far from Zhengwei Village. After it was abandoned, the villagers reclaimed the land and set up a charity warehouse in Fushan Hall, which could not only support the village, but also invest in public affairs, just like the current charity foundation. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The main industry in Zhengwei Village is timber. The towering ancient trees in the surrounding mountains are the village&#39;s greatest wealth. In ancient times, villagers cut down trees and put the wood into the river. Following the water flow, they arrived in Fuzhou. Until the reform and opening up, the village had always been an important part of the timber industry chain in northeastern Fujian. &quot;We still have land in Fuzhou, and we were relatively wealthy at that time.&quot; Zheng Fawang said that his ancestors were also engaged in the timber business. His ancestral house was built in the late Qing Dynasty and is located in the middle of Zhengwei Village. It is also a tall building. A mansion with deep walls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;By combining clan power with industry, the Zheng clan controls large areas of surrounding mountains and forests. Now several surrounding villages are also dominated by the Zheng surname. In ancient times, it was the &#39;sphere of influence&#39; of Zhengwei Village.&quot; said Zheng Jinlan, a staff member of the Dikou Town Cultural Station. Her hometown is in a village not far from Zhengwei Village, and her family&#39;s Zheng surname is derived from Zhengwei Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bad - As long as there are people’s activities, the buildings will be changed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walking in the alleys of the village, there were once tall ancient houses on both sides , many of which are only ruins. Not long after the Bailu solar term passed, a red paper notice for &quot;Bailu Tomb Sweeping&quot; was posted on the notice board in the village. It read &quot;Guimao Year, Bawu Cemetery&quot; - Bawu Gong was Zheng Hao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different from the general Qingming tomb sweeping, Zhengwei Village arranges ancestor worship and sweeping in the Bailu solar term every year. This custom is said to have lasted for hundreds of years. According to the villagers, during the white dew, the water comes out and the water steps in the stream are easier to walk, so it was decided to visit the tomb at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fushantang plays the role of the faith center in the small regional community centered on Zhengwei Village. When women in the village reach the age of 60, they will go to Fushan Hall to hold a grand ceremony, wearing special cyan clothes and bright red flowers on their heads, &quot;just like primary school students registering at school when they are old.&quot; Zheng Fawang said that the local People call them Qingyi Zhaipo.

They chanted sutras, burned incense and chatted. Joking and basking in the sun, the laughter often drowned out the sound of chanting sutras. Obviously, the religious space has become a public space. During the days when they read the scriptures, they temporarily left their families and spent a period of time with their sisters without trouble.

The architectural history of this temple has also been more than 200 years. The temple&#39;s beam reads the inscriptions during the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty. In the afternoon of the day, the villagers carried the idols and swim in the whole village. Finally, it went to the Fushan Hall on the left of the village. In the face of the Fushan Hall, everyone put the idol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Fourteen and fifteen days is a lively scene of the drama. The show is for God, of course, the mountain people in Shili and Eight Township can also look at it.

He found that many temples in Shanxi, especially the older and early, have been controlled by the cultural relics department, and the incense has gradually been cut off. The relationship between local residents and it is getting more and more alienated. &quot;The building and the life of people here are still closely related. The traditional sacrifice ritual, space, and belief habits can still be bound to this settlement and this building.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align : LEFT; &quot;>; In 1951, Zheng Weicun Elementary School was founded in Fushan Hall with dozens of students. In 1960, Fu Shantang was opened as a public canteen. Unlike the Shanxi Village Temple, the policy relaxed after the reform and opening up, and Fushan Hall soon became the center of Zhengwei Village&#39;s belief activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, faith activities and ancient construction protection seem to be a difficult contradiction. After the discovery of the Fushan Hall, the leaders of the Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics have repeatedly instructed Zheng Fangwang Fushan Hall. Zhou Miao remembered that in the 30th year of 2019, a burst of fire in the ancient gallery bridge of Jian&#39;ou City, &quot;because there are too many people burning incense on the bridge that day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As long as there are people&#39;s activities, the building will be changed. Sometimes this change is slow, growing slowly like Fu Shantang, and human activities are gently scrued like waves. But some fierce changes have been common in recent years. In early November 2023, it was not found that the Village, Gutian County, Fujian, was built in the 12th year of Ming Hongzhi (1499) in the 12th year of Ming Hongzhi (1499). &quot;Donkey is not a monster.&quot; Villagers have money and want to rebuild the ancestral temple. It is common for the ancestral ancestral temple, but I don&#39;t think this is a non -matching level of cultural and economic level. Until before being demolished by the villagers, it was neither cultural relic nor a historic building, and there was no protection identity at all. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;span>; empty-what to leave &lt;/span>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Before the founding of New China, Zheng Weicun was armed by his own forces village.

In the troubled times, the clan was self -defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the spring of 1936, the Communist Party of China established the Town of Jianqiakou as the center, including Jian&#39;er, Songxi, Zhenghe, Gutian, northeast Fujian, northeast Fujian. Guerrilla base. The villagers were quickly combined with the northeast Fujian guerrillas to become a reliable backup of guerrillas. As the villagers of Zhengwei Village are very familiar with firearms, the Zheng&#39;s Ancestral Hall in the center of the village naturally became the guerrilla firearm repair plant.

On May 13, 1948, Zeng Jingbing, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese and Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and more than 200 guerrilla members watched Gan opera with local villagers in Fushantang. Later, Fu Shantang became a general cultural relic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1982年，村民对福善堂大殿局部修缮，据暂不观察，当时的用料粗陋细小，“与原构相去甚远”， It may be that the conditions are too limited. In 2017, Zheng Weicun obtained the protection of the &quot;traditional Chinese village&quot;. The Fushan Hall and Porcelain Porcelain were repaired local. In 1982, the components that did not meet the specifications were replaced, and the roof was also renovated. Now in the temple, the light -colored wood is replaced in 2017, and the difference between the dark and old materials is clearly distinguished. It is this cautious repair that keeps many questions in Foshantang in Mo Shu&#39;s titles in mind.

Most of them have no protection identity. &quot;They have a very accurate and complete sorting of historical buildings.&quot; Liu Yan and Zhou Miao have a lot of contact with local ancient building enthusiasts in Fujian. Compared with official statistics, they sometimes rely on these people material. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;One problem now is that many local governments are actually unwilling to bear this risk, knowing that it is a valuable cultural relic, but it is not willing to report it. The situation exists. &quot;Zheng Jinlan told the reporter from the southern weekend. As long as it is not reported as a cultural relic point, no one needs to be responsible after being damaged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Protecting as many ancient architectural samples as possible is the basis for scholars to conduct systematic research. What is the position of Fu Shantang in the Yuan Dynasty architecture? Zhou Miao, who specializes in the Song and Yuan architecture, is difficult to say, &quot;because there are too few Yuan Dynasty architecture in the south.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The Yuan Dynasty buildings in the north are relatively retained, and in specific areas, the number can be analyzed as much as possible. &quot;In the north, it can be a level distinction of architecture in the Yuan Dynasty to comment on what different levels look like.&quot; Zhou Miao said. If Fushan Hall is placed in the northern yuan structure, then it is undoubtedly the level of low -level village Buddhist temples, but its hall is much larger than ordinary villages and temples. &quot;After the Northern Yuan Dynasty The combination of the structure of low -level buildings began to become messy, mixed, or messy and not particular about it. But the regulation and order of Foshantang are still pretty good, which is unexpected. &quot; /p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The Hall of Foshan Hall has gone through the storm of history, and now it is facing the empty nest of the countryside. Before the 1950s, there were more than 500 households in the village. Nowadays, there are only less than 800 people left in Zhengwei Village, and the entire administrative village (including 6 natural villages in the surrounding are). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Behind ancient buildings are not only discoverers and researchers, but also users who are closely related to them. After the logging industry disappeared, the village was in fact. The entire village costs about 200,000 yuan a year. The salary of the village committees and the village&#39;s sanitary expenses are sometimes difficult to guarantee. There are no young people in the village. After this generation of Tsing Yi Zhai&#39;s death, the daily maintenance and use of Fushantang is likely to lose activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Liu Yan is also very interested in the rituals and costumes of Tsing Yi Zhai, as well as the village&#39;s drama class. &quot;This village seems to have a kind of magic, which can retain so many ancient things.&quot; He plans to investigate and surveys and mapping again next year&#39;s winter vacation and summer vacation, and &quot;soak&quot; in the local area for a long time to do the field survey of real architecture anthropology. &quot;It is more interesting to combine people and architecture.&quot; He also understands that if he does not record as soon as possible, the whole cultural system around Fu Shantang will disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Jian&#39;er&#39;s &quot;upgrade&quot; movement of Fu Shantang is unfolding. Originally, Fushantang was just a general cultural protection point, and even the county insurance was not. Now it is promoted by &quot;cross -level&quot;. You can do a promotion work. &quot;Zheng Jinlan said. The provincial insurance is prepared for the future of the national security. &quot;The southern wood structure of the Yuan Dynasty will definitely enter the national insurance.&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Qingyi Zhai&#39;s daily lesson will definitely be affected by the upgrading of cultural relics protection levels. Zheng Fawang intends to prepare a tripod for them outside the temple so that the fragrant candle will no longer enter the hall. After bidding farewell to Qingyi Zhai, Liu Yanhe did not continue to drive north to visit Yunfeng Temple in Mountain Mountain. For the time being, it is a national security building in the west and east. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
