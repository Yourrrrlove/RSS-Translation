Standing below and looking up, I appear in the mirror, caught in a fishing net, with age symbols on the left and right. This is where different eras, regions and myself meet &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Liu Lang/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Look, everyone, this is the &#39;Big Egg Powder&#39; that has become very popular recently -&quot; A teacher-looking person pointed to the exhibit behind him with one hand and held up a microphone with the other, speaking to the person in front of him. said a dozen young people. They were wearing uniform white short T-shirts. It was probably a summer vacation activity organized by a nearby school. On August 29, 2023, the second GDMoA Annual Artist Academic Nomination Exhibition was launched at the Guangdong Museum of Art and will last until October 8. The works of the 21 nominated artists are displayed in several exhibition halls on two floors. They are rich in types and styles, attracting a steady stream of visitors. For several consecutive weekends, the admission quota for 1,000 people every half day has been reserved early, and there is a long queue at the entrance of the Guangdong Museum of Art. When the crowds are the strongest, it takes an hour to queue to enter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most photographed exhibit on social media in this exhibition is the &quot;big egg powder&quot; in front of these students. It was made by artist Feng Yu using bamboo curtains and wooden frames, and is called &quot;Wei&quot;. The work is introduced as &quot;an exploration of ancient space emotions, and also an extreme mechanical challenge to traditional Chinese soft materials.&quot; The bamboo curtains and wooden frames are curled and twisted to form several looping and twisting pipes, occupying nearly half of the venue, standing tall and full to the left and right. The promotion speech written by Zhang Zikang, director of the Central Academy of Fine Arts Art Museum, described it this way, &quot;The artist uses the relaxing combination of the movement rhythm of Chinese calligraphy to form a unique spatial scale experience and emotional experience. Every viewer will have a different feeling when entering it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IspoXu1Bh7c0Oomwnsl8AwykobOsjT79lvEohzGi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IspoXu1Bh7c0Oomwnsl8AwykobOsjT79lvEohzGi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252438&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Feng Yu’s work &quot;Wei&quot; is called &quot;Dan San&quot; on social media and is widely circulated&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Lang/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the feedback, in the audience’s feelings, it has derived an image that is more suitable for the Internet context - Dansan. Egg powder is a traditional snack in Guangdong. It is made of flour, gluten flour, eggs and lard, fried in oil until light yellow, scooped up and dipped in maltose before eating. In Cantonese, Dan San also refers to a timid or unpromising little person, taking his characteristic of being &quot;not strong enough&quot;. The color of the bamboo curtain and wooden frame is very similar to the light yellow color of the eggs when they come out of the pot, and the irregular bends are like the appearance of the eggs on the plate. Compared with the words in the recommendation, &quot;This spatial art installation will no longer be retained as the exhibition closes. Just like fireworks and life, no matter how gorgeous and bright they are, they will eventually pass away with the wind...&quot;, it is obvious that &quot;the eggs are scattered&quot; Closer to young people’s daily experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A work that is also highly visible on the Internet is the artist Song Dong&#39;s &quot;You&quot;, which is very Cantonese from its name - &quot;无&quot; comes from Cantonese, pronounced mǎo, meaning nothing, This word was first seen in &quot;Guangdong Tongzhi&quot; compiled by Huang Zuo during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty. From the perspective of word creation, the word &quot;无&quot; is the provincial meaning of the word &quot;有&quot;. Song Dong, who was born and raised in Beijing, has a close connection with Guangdong. His works were included in the first Guangzhou Art Biennale as early as 1992. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Guangzhou Fei Art Museum invited Song Dong to hold a solo exhibition. He walked around the vegetable market next to the art museum for a long time and thought that the smoky-looking vegetable market should not be separated from the tall Class A office buildings and private art museums next door. Can you make an unbounded wall? So, he built a 106-meter wall made of old windows. It was made of glass and walls. Various exhibitions could be held inside. The name of the work was &quot;Wall without Borders&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The art museum invites residents from surrounding communities to put in small items that they are reluctant to throw away at home, including Teresa Teng’s audio tapes, thermos bottles with double happiness printed on them, and even BB cameras. During the launch, the museum held a long street banquet. Everyone gathered around the 106-meter wall and chatted while eating Poon Choi: &quot;Where is the boundary between life and art?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Have You&quot;, Song Dong continued his previous style. A rectangular fishing net is pulled out on the second floor of the art museum, and it is covered with about 200 old mirrors. They have different shapes, but they have a unified sense of age. On the back of the mirror are yellowed figure paintings, calendar scenery, and various block letters. words, or clean and old brown wooden boards. When you stand under the work and look up, you will see yourself in the mirror, caught in a fishing net, with age symbols on the left and right. This is where different eras, regions and yourself come together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Dong wrote: &quot;The title of &quot;You&quot; uses the local characters of Guangdong, expressing the juxtaposition of the words &#39;have&#39; and &#39;no&#39; to form the title. I have always believed that nothing is the ultimate The big being is the great nothing. The mirror is not only an indispensable object in life, but also a philosophical object for thinking and understanding. I have been asking &#39;what is a mirror&#39; for a long time, and I think &#39;everything is Mirror&#39;, the mirror divides the world into real and virtual, existence and non-existence. It also integrates real and virtual, existence and non-existence into one place. It is the critical interface between &#39;being&#39; and &#39;empty&#39;. I use a big net to catch The collected mirrors form a &#39;diaphragm&#39;, dividing the space into virtual and real worlds. These mirrors have seen different people and objects, and they are constantly refreshed and vacated. As the saying goes: everything is a mirror body and place. , catching all emptiness and nothingness in one sweep.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This thinking text received another interpretation from the students. After they stared at the &quot;Egg Powder&quot; for a few minutes, the teacher asked: &quot;Do you want to go in and have a look? The original intention of this artwork is to hope that the audience can walk among it, interact with the work, feel the changes in the space, and have different emotional experiences.&quot; . Do you think so?&quot; After receiving a unanimous nod, she said with a smile: &quot;But now it&#39;s blocked and you can&#39;t get in. Let&#39;s just close our eyes, imagine, and pretend we&#39;re walking through it. Come on, let&#39;s start. ——&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They really closed their eyes and entered a kind of existence and non-being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 13:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[最后的“老猎”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258331]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 12:10:29&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[放下猎枪20年：使鹿鄂温克人的现代化之路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258325]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021856083094&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;China&#39;s last hunting tribe, raising reindeer in the Daxingan Mountains.mov&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/axGGjfymsBkbfbnrKyhAdFttnt16PyWWEfk3fGGH.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/d97a528f5576678021856083094/ lX55HJ107gwA.mov&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot; 360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/d97a528f5576678021856083094/lX55HJ107gwA.mov&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A kind of turbulence The infectious disease is spreading among the reindeer in Aoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of July 18, 2023, veterinarian Lao Ge received a notice from the village that four reindeer had died in a row at a tourist spot, and he had to go check what was going on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aoxiang, the full name is Aoluguya Ewenki National Township. Driving 250 kilometers northeast from Hailar, the central city of Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, is Genhe, the county-level city where Aoxiang is located. It borders Mohe, the northernmost part of China, and is the &quot;China Cold Pole&quot; certified by &lt;span>;National Climate Center&lt;/span>; ”——The annual average temperature is minus 5.3 degrees Celsius, and the heating period is 9 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Genhe, the name that is more famous than &quot;China&#39;s Cold Pole&quot; is undoubtedly &quot;Ewenki&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki are one of the ethnic groups with a small population in China. According to statistics from the seventh census, there are 34,617 people in this ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, there were three tribes of the Ewenki people. Among them, the safari Yakuts are called the &quot;deer tribe&quot; because they raise reindeer. The Ewenki people in Aoxiang are descendants of the Shilu tribe, also known as the Shilu Ewenki people. Their population has always hovered between one and two hundred people. They are the smallest micro-group within the tribe and the only ethnic group that raises reindeer in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rudolph the Red-Nosed, who pulls Santa’s sleigh, is the star among the reindeer. This is an animal that lives in the tundra around the Arctic Circle. Its two towering antlers are more than one meter long and have many branches like tree branches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the reindeer in Aoxiang are facing a survival crisis. Lao Ge judged that the reindeer that died this time had a high probability of suffering from a blood parasitic disease with a very high fatality rate. He was &quot;not surprised&quot; by this situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;In 2003, Genhe implemented the &quot;ecological immigration&quot; policy. The Evenki people who originally lived in the deep forests put down their shotguns and went down the mountains to settle. Lao Ge suspected that the reindeer&#39;s illness may be related to the small animals that come with tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In media reports, the Ewenki people are called &quot;China&#39;s last hunting nation.&quot; Today&#39;s Ewenki people are ending hunting and embracing a modern lifestyle. They also face the process of adaptation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for this micro-ethnic group, which has been maintained at a scale of a hundred people for a long time, it is also a choice that must be made in order to survive and develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/qRn508Oi3WcF8vf82ReSkwFmTsVqMaPgORodRf9U.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/qRn508Oi3WcF8vf82ReSkwFmTsVqMaPgORodRf9U.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253537&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 18, 2023, tourists fed reindeer in the largest reindeer park in Aoxiang. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I miss you very much in Aoluguya&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;Ewenki originally means &quot;people who live in the mountains and forests.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, both humans and deer lived in the deep forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, and reindeer had never been heard of contracting infectious diseases. &quot;It&#39;s hard for reindeer to work in the mountains.&quot; Lao Ge sighed, &quot;There&#39;s nothing we can do to make money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being a veterinarian, Lao Ge also has another identity - the operator of the largest reindeer park in Aoxiang. By. On the way to see a doctor, his cell phone rang almost every ten minutes. Most of the calls were made by acquaintances who wanted to waive the 70 yuan ticket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Visitors who visit the reindeer park for the first time are often surprised: the reindeer roam freely in the scenic area without fences, and people can freely have close contact with them. If you spend 20 yuan to buy a basket of fresh moss, you will soon be stared at by the reindeer&#39;s big round eyes, its round and soft nose will come over, and it will dig straight into the basket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff teaches tourists how to take very dynamic photos: lift a bamboo basket filled with moss above your head and run, and the herd of reindeer will follow obediently. However, most tourists were so frightened that they dropped their bamboo baskets on the ground when they heard the hoofbeats of the reindeer behind them. At this time, you can always hear the staff shouting from behind, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, don&#39;t be afraid, the reindeer will not hurt people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Besides the reindeer, Lao Ge himself is considered the second &quot;star&quot; in the reindeer park. &quot;. He is 51 years old, a mixed race of Ewenki and Russian, with curly silver hair, a high nose bridge, deep eye sockets, and bronze skin. It is said that he looked like the French movie star Alain Delon when he was young. Tourists who have done some planning in advance often take photos with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If reporters visit, the local propaganda department will most likely bring them to Lao Ge. He has a strong desire for expression and a vivid Northeastern dialect, which always makes reporters come home with a full load. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the time, tourists can find him in the most luxurious hotel in the park. Choluozi is the traditional residence of the Ewenki people in the mountains and forests. More than ten pine trees are intertwined to form a cone shape, and a layer of birch bark is spread outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why the tuoluozi is said to be &quot;luxurious&quot; is because the birch bark is densely surrounded by a layer of roe deer skin. There are dozens of them. According to Lao Ge, the cost is &quot;worth seventy-eight dollars at least.&quot; Ten thousand&quot;. In the past, that was a treatment enjoyed only by &quot;old hunters&quot; (the term given to experienced hunters). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going west from Luyuan, less than 10 minutes’ drive by sightseeing bus, you will find the settlement of the Evenki people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2003, the Evenki hunters had just moved to this settlement. There were 62 bungalows with red roofs and white walls in the settlement. In 2008, in order to develop tourism, the Aoxiang government renovated the house and specially invited a Finnish construction company to design it. The exterior facade was covered with dark brown wooden boards and the sloping eaves were wider, aiming to create a &quot;Nordic style&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, except for a dozen families who still live here, most families have moved into residential communities in Genhe City. Their houses in Aoxiang have been converted into B&amp;Bs and specialty shops. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I miss you in Aoluguya&quot; - the now pervasive Internet celebrity street signs have also invaded Aoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beside the street sign is the most conspicuous house with a huge reindeer mural painted on the exterior wall. It is a B&amp;B run by Yang Lan, the granddaughter of Maria Suo, &quot;the last female chief in China&quot; . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maria Suo is the prototype of the protagonist in Chi Zijian&#39;s novel &quot;The Right Bank of the Ergun River&quot;. She died on August 20, 2022, at the age of 101. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many tourists are attracted by the old man’s legendary experience and follow his footsteps. On a sightseeing bus, the tour guide told the tourists the story of Maria Soo adopting a dozen orphans. &quot;How come I didn&#39;t see any of them?&quot; the sightseeing bus driver muttered after hearing this fictional story. The title of &quot;the last female chief&quot; is somewhat of a packaging color. There is no chief among the Ewenki people, but Maria Suo is indeed the most respected elder among the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Can&#39;t you tell some true stories?&quot; However, for this driver, there is nothing to complain about. Driving a sightseeing bus in scenic spots gives him an extra 3,000 yuan in monthly income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to climate restrictions, Aoxiang’s tourist season is short. In previous years, Aoxiang’s attractions were only open from June 1st to October 8th. In 2023, due to the influence of the Zibo Barbecue Fever, the working season of the reindeer was advanced one month. At the end of April, before the snow had completely melted, the scenic spot opened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/PxXZX0PVOrtCubThYs07UZs3yAmsHN6hBa6hkX9b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1099&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/PxXZX0PVOrtCubThYs07UZs3yAmsHN6hBa6hkX9b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Migration route map of the Ewenki people. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The third settlement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;During the tourist season, Whenever he gets the chance, Lao Ge still likes to jump to the deer spot on the mountain. There was no cell phone signal there, and no one could find him. It was quiet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for the 32 reindeer that come down the mountain to &quot;work&quot;, most of Laoge&#39;s reindeer are still herding deep in the Greater Khingan Mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After some hunters came down to settle down in the mountains, they still maintained &quot;deer spots&quot; where reindeer were grazed on the mountains. Officially, Deer Point is also called Hunters Point to distinguish it from the settlements at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 26, 2023, Lao Ge set off from Aoxiang, traveled more than 200 kilometers north to Alongshan Town, and then drove into the forest fire road from the only main street in the town. On the road, birch trees and larches are scattered at random, rose-red willows grow wildly on the roadside, and sables pass quickly in front of the car from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Walking another 60 kilometers along the fire road, you can reach his deer spot, a place that cannot be pinpointed on the map. Lao Ge hired four relatives to take turns guarding the more than 180 reindeer on the mountain. As soon as we got off the car, the air was filled with a strong scent of pine. Four or five hounds approached Lao Ge with their tails wagging, and the sound of deer bells could be heard in the nearby woods. This is the environment the Evenki people are most familiar with. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, the Ewenki were divided into three tribes: Solon, Tungus and Yakut, each engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry and hunting. In 1957, after ethnic identification, these three tribes were collectively called the Ewenki. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lv Guangtian, an ethnology scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has verified that as early as 2000 BC, the ancestors of the Evenki people lived on the shores of Lake Transbaikal and Lake Baikal. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Shilu Ewenki people (hereinafter the Ewenki people are specifically referred to as the &quot;Shilu tribe&quot;) came to the Greater Khingan Mountains on the right bank of the Ergun River, the border river between China and Russia, and never left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People living in the mountains and forests&quot; began to descend from the mountains after the founding of New China. At that time, the Ewenki people were hunting on the right bank of the Ergun River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1957, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region approved the establishment of Qigan Ewenki National Township. Since then, allowing the Evenki people to settle has become a goal that the party committee and government hope to achieve. After the government built the wooden house (a typical Russian dwelling made of wood and mud), the Ewenki people had a place to settle for the first time. However, although they have a home at the foot of the mountain, except for the township head and the director of the supply and marketing cooperative who live there all year round, the rest of them live in a state of settlement and hunting. They hunt in the mountains for a long time and occasionally live at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, the Ewenki settlement moved eastward from Qigan to a place 17 kilometers north of Mangui Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi, who once served as deputy director of the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress of Genhe City, is a researcher of Ewenki culture. He said that the location of the relocation was very particular: in order to resolve the conflict between hunting and settlement, the settlement was chosen to be close to the hunting grounds and suitable for reindeer living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is the original and real Aoxiang, so named because it is surrounded by the Aoluguya River. In the Ewenki language, &quot;Aoluguya&quot; means a place with lush poplar trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to distinguish it from Aoxiang after the relocation in 2003, the settlement chosen at that time was habitually called &quot;Old Aoxiang&quot;. For the Ewenki people, the period after the relocation was their &quot;golden years.&quot; Schools, grain depots, post offices, hospitals, cultural stations and banks were built where 126 Evenki people originally lived. In order to develop the economy, the township has also set up wood processing plants, hunting production teams and ethnic trading companies. Foreigners also came. At its peak, there were more than 500 people living in Lao Ao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi recalled that in Lao Ao Township, the Ewenki people were considered &quot;nobles&quot;. Maria Suo&#39;s family became the first 10,000-yuan household in the township in the 1980s. Many Ewenki families have bought cameras, bicycles, and &quot;several watches.&quot; It does not cost money to go to school and see a doctor, and students can also receive living allowances. &quot;All outsiders are willing to marry Ewenki people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, young Ewenki people had settled at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Kong Fanzhi, by the 1980s, 40 of the 71 Ewenki adults in Aoxiang had jobs, becoming the first generation of teachers, doctors, drivers, and waiters among the tribe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;However, nearly 40 years after moving to Lao Ao Township, the public facilities have begun to age, the government buildings have cracked, and the power grid and dams need to be repaired. The repair cost is estimated to be more than 10 million yuan, which is greatly exceeded. Root River&#39;s financial ability to pay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, the State Council launched the Western Development Plan, with funds earmarked for ecological migration. Therefore, the leaders of Genhe City decided that instead of repairing in situ, it would be better to apply for &quot;ecological immigration&quot;, and the funds would also come from a source. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The leader’s idea led to the third settlement in the history of the Evenki people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;At 8 a.m. on August 10, 2003, the first batch of relocated 11 households with 37 people and 260 reindeer took 12 Dongfeng extended vehicles and headed for the new rural address more than 200 kilometers away. ——Departs from a place only 4 kilometers away from Genhe city. Teams organized by towns along the way lined the road to see off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Genhe City Chronicle records that at 4 p.m., the convoy arrived at the new Aoxiang in the drizzle. &quot;The new township site had colorful flags flying, gongs and drums roaring, and two elderly yangko teams singing and dancing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten days before the move, Kong Fanzhi started busy receiving reporters. They recorded the last class of the school in Lao Ao Township, the &quot;minimum post office&quot; with only one employee, and the last bonfire before departure. Party. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;Return to hometown after one day down the mountain&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This relocation attracted Xie Yuanyuan, a Ph.D. in sociology from Peking University. On September 18, 2003, she arrived in Aoxiang and began a one-year field investigation. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What aroused her interest was the reversal of the hunters&#39; emotions. Before setting off, she noticed the report in &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Beijing Youth Daily&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&quot;, the title was &quot;&lt;/span>;China&#39;s last hunting nation&lt;span>;The Ewenki people returned home after just one day of going down the mountain. Township&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Beijing Youth Daily&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Reporters at&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Hunter&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;relocation times&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Visiting Aoxiang on the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; day, I found that the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;yard was surprisingly quiet&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, and &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;some houses were empty&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;. Some hunters made a rough calculation: the annual income of a reindeer is about &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;200 Yuan &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; no &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; investment when raising stock in the mountains. After going down the mountain, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;we have to &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; reindeer &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; in captivity &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; just the feed money, every day A reindeer costs thousands of dollars every year. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Originally, what the government promised was that the hunters would move, the reindeer would be kept in captivity, and someone would feed them. “The hunters would just hold the wine bottle and watch the reindeer smile.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reality is that there is no feed at all in the rows of deer pens blocked by brick-red barbed wire in the settlement. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;During the relocation&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, some reindeer were lost, injured, and some were not used to eating bean cakes and choked to death. A total of more than 90 reindeer were lost. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Li Mengchu, chairman of the Aoxiang People’s Congress, was the Minister of Armed Forces of Aoxiang at the time. He recalled that at that time, the township government mobilized cadres to go up the mountain to collect moss, mushrooms and willow twigs. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;A reindeer can eat a sack of moss in a day&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, which is equivalent to what one person can harvest in a day. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;A few days later, the hunters &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; took the deer out of the deer pen and led &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; back to the mountain. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;They&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;first &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; reared them around Aoxiang, but &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;the moss in the mountains and forests around the city did not grow well&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Go north again&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and continue deep into the hinterland of the Greater Khingan Mountains&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, there are 14 deer spots scattered in the mountains and forests of Xinlao Ao Township. &lt;p>; span>;20 years later, when talking about this matter, a former deputy mayor of Aoxiang said bluntly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Writer Chi Zijian visited Aoxiang in 2004 and found that there was not a single reindeer in the deer pen, only a group of lazy goats wandering along the overgrown path. Go shopping. The butterfly effect caused by this situation was that the Ewenki people descended from the mountain and became the origin of the writing of &quot;The Right Bank of the Ergun River&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;While reindeer were being raised in captivity&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Evenki people&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; also put down their shotguns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, as early as 1988, with the promulgation of the Wildlife Protection Law, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; it was clear that &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; hunting was prohibited , killing national key protected wild animals&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;common prey of the Ewenki people, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;moose&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, black bear, roe deer, gray rat &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;They are all on the list&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. In 1996, the Gun Management Law was promulgated, which imposed stricter regulations on civilian use of guns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At that time, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Xie Yuanyuan obtained a document clarifying the meaning of &quot;ecological migration&quot; of the Ewenki people from the then director of the Ethnic Affairs Bureau of Genhe City. She was attracted by a few &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; short sentences with strong tone: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1. If the mode of production does not change, settling down will become a sentence Empty words. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2. Without changing the mode of production, it will be difficult for various economies to develop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The material clearly expresses the point of view: to change the production method, reindeer must be kept in captivity so that hunters can put down their shotguns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This also makes the third settlement essentially different from the first two: in the past two settlements, the government did not restrict the Evenki people’s choices, but instead increased their travel options. An alternative to hunting. But this time, the goal of letting the Evenki people go down the mountain to settle down is more clear. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;We must change the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;safari &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; such &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; &quot;production&quot; Way&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ecological immigration has accelerated the process of closing guns. Li Mengchu remembered that the Public Security Bureau confiscated the guns of the Ewenki hunters right after they moved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Gu Taozeng, a documentary director who filmed the &quot;Ewenki Trilogy&quot;, recorded&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;this process&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. Li Mengchu&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;is concerned about&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;that the Evenki people&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;have hunted for generations to survive&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and their guns are gone. , which means a change in the tradition of hunting people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Changes inevitably bring confusion. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Two months after the relocation&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;More than a month later, the then Aoxiang Party Committee Secretary&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Liu Panchang&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;’s nose bone was hunted by Ewenki The people interrupted, and the township head Gu Xianglian, who was also an Ewenki, was sued by his own aunt. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Xianglian’s aunt wrote to the then Secretary of the Hulunbuir Municipal Party Committee: “In the past, without subsidies or assistance, the hunters lived quite well. But now, in Genhe &quot;To subsidize life is just like begging for food.&quot; &quot;This is not trying to achieve a well-off life, it&#39;s just trying to make us eat chaff!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as it&#39;s time to go to work, a circle of people rush into Gu Xianglian&#39;s office. The long sofas on both sides of the room were filled with villagers, and the radiator by the window was also crowded with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancient fragrant lotus has nothing to do with it. She complained to Xie Yuanyuan: &quot;I have no selfish intentions at all. I don&#39;t have a house of my own, so I live in a hunter&#39;s business. It&#39;s worse than a hunter&#39;s house! If you were to be the mayor of the township, what would you do?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are problems everywhere. In November, the temperature in Aoxiang reached subzero, the new house began to get damp, and black hair grew on the walls of the house. The floor made of wooden boards in Lao Aoxiang was replaced by milky white ceramic tiles. &lt;span>;The designer obviously doesn’t have much experience in rural life. As soon as you enter the house in winter, the snow stuck to the soles of your shoes melts quickly, and you may slip&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; accidentally. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Making a living has become difficult&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the Ewenki people used to be respected in Lao Ao Township&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;It seems&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is gone too. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Their appearance is easily identifiable: high cheekbones and deep-set eye sockets. When Xie Yuanyuan and Ewenki women went shopping in a store in Genhe City, they would always see the clerk pointing out, &quot;Look, that&#39;s from Aoxiang.&quot; The restaurant owner also laughed at Xie Yuanyuan for their old-fashioned ways: they only served free side dishes and drank almost all the wine. Before the main dishes were served, I paid and left. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yuanyuan recorded the scene she saw in the winter of 2003: except for the hunters raising reindeer, there was almost nothing for others to do. The only way for pure hunters to amuse themselves is to drink, drinking low-quality liquor that costs 1.5 yuan per pound and is filled with mineral water bottles. &quot;There are three or five people, very quiet, not talking or laughing, just leaning on the sofa or leaning on the bed.&quot; Drinking like that. It feels like they want to get into a state of &#39;drunkness&#39;, the sooner the better.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Twenty years have passed, and Gu Xianglian, who was the township head at the time of the relocation, is now the deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Genhe Municipal People’s Congress. &quot;There is no need to talk about the past.&quot; On July 28, 2023, in her office, she quickly interrupted the reporter&#39;s question, &quot;Go to Aoxiang and see for yourself. I don&#39;t know how much everyone&#39;s living standards have improved. . That&#39;s a huge change.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/mtXgU30A1jUSpsFVSkB0wppXC6tGAq5bHLcoNYyr.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1014&quot; height=&quot;758&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/mtXgU30A1jUSpsFVSkB0wppXC6tGAq5bHLcoNYyr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253539&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Ewenki hunter settlement in Aoxiang is full of Nordic style. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;“Almost forgotten everything”&lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The latest improvement in living standards &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; celebrates &quot;ecological migration&quot; &quot;20th anniversary. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 12, 2023, at the celebration ceremony, 15 dark green high-power tractors were lined up, which were allocated to the mountain&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Deer point. A month ago, the township &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;had &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;replaced &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; each deer spot with 5,000-watt solar energy storage panels. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;When fully charged &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; , the solar panel &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; can provide &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;8 kWh of electricity. This means that you can use a refrigerator, TV, rice cooker, and even hot pot at the same time on the mountain. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The summer travel season has also met expectations, ushering in a major outbreak three years after the epidemic. The price of accommodation in the two hotels in the scenic area is about 1,000 yuan per night. The price of a B&amp;B with simple facilities not far from the scenic spot starts at 500 yuan per night, and it must be booked at least a week in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Genhe, a resource-based city built for forestry, has now positioned the cultural and tourism industry as the &quot;city-building industry&quot; in the government work report, and &quot;Aolugu Ya&quot; has become a key focus The “brand” created. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The living standards of hunters have improved a lot in recent years, and the original oppositional emotions have almost been forgotten.” Kong Fanzhi said when talking about the development of Aoxiang in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Change cannot occur without reindeer. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, three years after the relocation, Li Mengchu was appointed deputy mayor of Aoxiang. How to allow the Ewenki hunters to make a living under the mountains became a difficult problem that he had to face as soon as he took office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long after taking office, he organized the first Reindeer King Competition, hoping to build the reputation of the reindeer. According to the plan, the antlers of the top three deer kings will be auctioned on site. Worried that no one would bid, Li Mengchu specially arranged a few &quot;trustees&quot; in the auditorium. Unexpectedly, the person in charge of a company auctioned off all the top three antlers, and the most expensive pair was auctioned for 7,000 yuan. At that time, an adult reindeer was worth only 5,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The township government also took over the entire township’s deer antler business. Deer antlers are deer antlers that have not yet been boned. In traditional Chinese medicine, they are considered to have nourishing properties. Starting in 2005, Li Mengchu led the township cadres to various deer spots to cut the antlers, which would be processed by the township, packaged and sold. &quot;After the sales are completed, the hunters will be given money, and they will be happy with every penny they receive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a few years of unified sales, hunters no longer need government support. After the rise of tourism in Aoxiang, deer antlers are sold by the same gram as ginseng, with prices ranging from 8 to 20 yuan per gram depending on the quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reindeer is the spirit of the Greater Khingan Mountains and the treasure of the Ewenki people.&quot; Lao Ge often repeated this sentence when interviewed by the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one can say how the tourism industry in Qing Ao Township became so popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the Ewenki people came down from the mountain, the Aoxiang government made plans for tourism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xie Yuanyuan was investigating in Aoxiang, the government had built a &quot;folk custom village&quot;. At first, there were only two buildings: a tent and a tuoluozi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The township government arranged for Asuo, a young male hunter, to live in a tent and raise 6 reindeer nearby. As long as he stays there, Asuo can receive a monthly salary of 100 yuan. However, Asuo&#39;s situation seemed awkward: he stayed there alone, drinking, dazed, and being sucked by mosquitoes. Later, the township leaders said that the &quot;Folk Custom Village&quot; was located in a remote location and lacked &quot;life&quot;, so Asuo&#39;s &quot;work&quot; was stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, hunters gradually took over the business of the folk village, but they were all in a slump. In 2007, with the support of the township government, Lao Ge invested more than 100,000 yuan, and the township government signed a ten-year contract to take over the business of the reindeer park. &quot;I never dreamed of it, but it started slowly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Li Mengchu’s impression, around 2008, Hulunbuir’s tourism business suddenly became popular. At that time, tourists drove around Genhe and couldn&#39;t find a place to stay. &quot;They were all confused at the time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge’s specific feelings about Aoxiang’s tourism industry “taking off” come from the increasing number of reporters visiting. Several groups of reporters from different CCTV channels came. The camera crew of Japan&#39;s NHK&#39;s &quot;China Railway Journey&quot; also came, as well as teams from Thailand, Singapore, and South Korea. Reporters from various countries came to see it all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also took reindeer to Changsha to record the variety show &quot;Happy Camp&quot;. Lao Ge clearly remembers the broadcast time of the March 5, 2011 issue. He chartered a truck, hired two drivers, and took the reindeer with him, and it took him 85 hours to reach Changsha. Finally, the Ewenki clip appeared on the show for 5 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge was originally worried that the reindeer would be frightened after coming on stage and run wild all over the place. The result was good, the deer was calm and even peed on the stage. On the contrary, he himself was very nervous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This deer was later named &quot;Little Hunan&quot; by Lao Ge. The day after returning to Aoxiang, &quot;Little Hunan&quot; disappeared. Half a month later, a forestry worker 40 kilometers away discovered it. Its mouth and body were covered with hunter&#39;s nooses. &quot;Little Hunan&quot; did not survive that autumn and passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，一位湖南游客专程赶到驯鹿园，花2000元买走了“小湖南”的鹿角。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/LshBZyp56uNBLZi123aXA1287nCOlpYo2v8q7kmf.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;年轻时，他入伍当过消防兵。转业后被分配到乡政府当司法助理。那时他留着浓密的黑色长发，带自然卷，像个摇滚明星。现在，他56岁，头发花白，脸上爬满皱纹，眼睛被挤得只剩下一条缝，牙几乎全掉光了。衰老已完全征服了他。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从卧室到长椅不足十米，是卓耶每天的行动距离。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;26年前，何协在家擦枪，枪走火，子弹穿过薄薄的墙板，射入卓耶脑袋，至今没取出。这场意外让她的右腿丧失行动力。此后她不再出门，身体越来越胖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有好奇的游客路过门前，问起夫妻俩鄂温克人的故事时，何协总会慢悠悠地踱进屋子，从冰箱顶取下两大本相册——智能手机还没流行的年代，到访的记者、摄影师们洗出照片后总会邮寄给他。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;照片里，他们在森林里滑雪、唱歌、晾晒肉干。想吃肉了，提起枪就出门。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一提到打猎，那个抖擞的猎民青年才会短暂回归——何协是族人里不会失手的“老猎”。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回忆里的事情都足够久远了。照片里的鄂温克猎民大多已经过世，死因多少和酒精有些关系。玛丽亚·索的7个儿女，如今只剩下何协和他的姐姐德克莎。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“要不是我看着他，他也早没了。”卓耶说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“不喝酒，还能干啥？”何协又把话顶回去。他的回忆似乎永远停在山林里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;内蒙古社科院民族研究所研究员白兰关注鄂温克人已有三十多年，和何协一家也成了老友。有时候，白兰会收到卓耶发来的语音，感慨以前家门口都是人，现在，就剩他俩了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“现在各有各的忙，哪还有时间跟他喝酒呢。”在白兰看来，何协作为“何老大”的傲气消失了。何协爱张罗，一有点钱，就呼朋唤友地请人喝酒。而如今的敖乡，不再遵从过去的那套秩序。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/kdRbls3Jq6AprFfu5f2yAbPlRrJThsUqHp55Ojoe.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;36岁的古木森在短视频平台上有30万粉丝。 2022年，他创办了自己的传媒公司，签约乡里的年轻人做“艺人”，靠网络上积攒的粉丝拉来了游客。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也有部分去大城市闯荡的人们回流。大学毕业后，觉乐原本在北京一家医院做行政，在北京买房、结婚、生子。但他觉得医院的工作枯燥，待在格子间“像是开启了机械模式”。 2016年，觉乐回到根河，在离敖乡不远处经营了一个旅游点，“特别开阔，就跟玩儿似的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在敖乡做旅游生意，的确能带来可观的收入。觉乐估计，2023年夏天靠旅游业赚下十多万，够维持一家人整个冬天的开销。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;白兰给何协提过建议，两口子待人接物幽默，何协口琴又吹得好，要是把家里收拾干净，做点旅游业的小生意，也能挣上钱。何协不乐意干，觉得“没意思”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何协仍保持着一种粗粝的喝酒法：先猛灌几日，劲儿上来，再睡上几天几夜，酒醒后，再起来继续喝。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;曾被人羡慕的老猎，成了亲戚们眼里被落下的、“没进步”的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年7月末，何协回了趟老敖乡。那块土地在鄂温克人迁出不多久，就被大庆的一位房地产商人收购，计划开发国际狩猎场。结果计划流产，狩猎场没建起来，以前的老木刻楞房倒是全给扒了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老敖乡成了一片荒废之地，路边的野草长得足有半人高。何协背着手，把老敖乡转了一圈，没认出自己家房子在哪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同行者问他，要是允许他再回来养鹿，还愿意不？他认真想了想，这地方长期没人住，附近的狼、猞猁都多了起来，“再回来，或许也不合适了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;“浪漫派”与“现实派”&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;临近国庆，一头棕熊成了敖乡的重磅新闻。 2023年9月26日早上5点多，老革接到电话，熊进驯鹿园了——还是从检票口进的，轻车熟路。这已是它半个月内第三次光顾鹿园。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老革调侃，“要是它再来，那我俩可得拜把子了”。提起出现频率越来越高的野兽，山上的养鹿人语气没那么轻松。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年，一头棕熊造访了杨兰家的鹿点，一晚上拍死7头驯鹿。还有户人家，在狼群到访后，三十多头驯鹿只剩下8头。兽害最严重的一年，整个敖乡损失了两百多头驯鹿——驯鹿总数共一千三百多头，也就是说，每6头驯鹿里，就有1头因兽害死亡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实在是恼火，杨兰的父亲同她抱怨，要是能把枪还给猎民一周，就能把兽害的问题给解决了。要不然，再过几年，养鹿人在山里生存都面临人身危险。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不论说者还是听者，都知道这只是气话。都是国家保护动物，谁还敢打？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鄂温克人也逐渐失去在山林里的生存能力，这让白兰感到有些焦虑。现代与传统该如何取舍与抉择？ “所有的一切给予了使鹿鄂温克一种外力的干预，所以这个文化将不可避免地有它的硬伤。”2003年生态移民伊始，接受媒体采访时，白兰就提出了这样的观点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她觉得，如果猎民能决定自己发展的模式，在民族地区能获得一定的资源管理和使用权，可以适度伐木、狩猎，情况也许会有所不同。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那是文人的看法。”2003年，孔繁志就同白兰有场隔空辩论。如今再提起来时，他还是无法认同白兰的观点。 “总不能为了保护传统文化，还让鄂温克人住在撮罗子里吧？谁不想过上现代化的生活？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在谢元媛看来，这两种态度，来自截然不同的价值判断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;调研时，她同玛丽亚·索在鹿点生活了大半个月。早上五点多起床干活，打列巴、挤鹿奶、采野果、熟皮子、缝皮子货……日子过得简单、重复，没人觉得生活还需要有什么变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，不同年龄的鄂温克人又有不同的追求。年轻一些的猎民，见到了更广阔的世界，自然会觉得自己民族的习俗是落后的，想做出改变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谢元媛在博士论文末尾也写道，眷恋森林生活的传统猎民并没有参与进话语权，不能轻易牺牲掉那些对人类长远发展更有价值和意义的东西”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;20年后，博士生谢元媛成了清华大学国家战略研究院研究员。如今，在她看来，白兰的观点是“浪漫派”，而孔繁志则代表“现实派”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;微型群体走进现代化，是一种社会发展的必然。现在的谢元媛觉得，从国家治理的层面上看，为了民族发展，这是必须要做出的牺牲。面对现实，理性的态度是，记住那部分人，给予他们及后代一定的补偿，“这才是现实”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，从使鹿鄂温克人的第一次定居、接触外部世界后，一些传统已慢慢在改变。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鄂温克语没有文字，只能通过一代代人口口相传。即便是何协、老革这般年纪的人，能使用的鄂温克语，也不及老人们的一半。鄂温克人在半个世纪前最常用的交通工具桦皮船，也早就从大兴安岭的河道漂进了博物馆。在老革年轻时，就开始用几个橡胶轮胎绑一块当船用，比做桦皮船简单多了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从1957年鄂温克猎民第一次定居算起，现在回家养鹿、经营旅游业的年轻人已经是定居后的第三代。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那再下一代呢？ ”&amp;nbsp;白兰觉得，正当年的第三代人从小在山林中长大，多少对驯鹿有感情，如今还没成年的第四代孩子，从小就生活在水泥地上，“以后驯鹿是啥，可能都不关心了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孔繁志则觉得，驯鹿不会在敖乡消失，它如今是使鹿鄂温克人最重要的标志，也是游客们奔向敖乡的原因，“别的没啥说的了”。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;1917年2月初，湖南省政府批准蔡公遗孤教养协会立案，公布了协会的七条规则和职员名单：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;本协会以筹画替理蔡公遗孤教养事宜为职。 （二）本协会公推评议员若干人执行左列职务：规画遗孤教养方针；筹措保管分配遗孤教养费；推定主任。 （三）本协会推定左列各项主任受评议员全体之委托执行其职务：教育主任，主计画监督遗孤教育之进行、审度学科、选择学校、考察学绩等；驻湘会计主任，主在湘教养费之保管；驻沪会计主任，主在沪教养费之保管。 （四）各主任须将职务上进行情形，每半年报告评议员一次，若进行有障碍时，求评议员全体之解决。 （五）评议员之评议以通信行之。 （六）各主任有辞职者，由评议员全体审查改推。 （七）本协会俟遗孤成年后，由评议员全体决议撤销之。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;梁启超是蔡公遗孤教养协会的发起人，在蔡锷逝世的次月即拟定了协会规则，征求了相关人员同意，由石陶钧就近提请湘省政府立案。梁启超起草的立案呈词情理俱壮：“故上将服官滇桂，供职京都，先后凡十余年，时以国事忧劳，家计未遑过问，清风两袖，劲节孤鸣，刻下白发在堂，黄口在抱，善后事宜百端待理。超等或素同患难，或谬许知交，悲元勋之长逝，通遗孤之无依，爰集同人，组织蔡公遗孤教养协会。关于遗孤教养事宜本会应随时悉心规画、协力赞助，务期六尺有托，蔚国器于将来，内顾无忧，慰英魂于地下。”本已参与其事的湘省政府省长谭延闿，当即批示备案，并饬令湘江道尹暨长沙、宝庆两县知事一体查照。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/KhSZoB5bYYKmJgoXQpy6K3S6p68uWuMO6VwV12Zj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/KhSZoB5bYYKmJgoXQpy6K3S6p68uWuMO6VwV12Zj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253482&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《谭延闿日记》中关于蔡锷遗孤教养协会的记载。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;梁启超对蔡公遗孤教养协会的设计颇费心思，其目标任务、责任分工及运作方式均明确可行。早在1916年12月初，熊希龄便提出：“时局变幻莫测，为松公遗族筹恤，似宜从速通电中央、各省借助”，并请梁启超领衔通电募集。梁启超通过在沪与蔡锷遗族接触，发现“其家事极纠纷”，于是决定发起成立蔡公遗孤教养协会，以减少家庭矛盾对遗孤教养的影响。也不采取通电筹集善款，以免违背蔡锷“生前耿介之意”，而是发动亲友赠送，并拟以版税补助。所邀请之人经过了梁启超选择，或是蔡锷的师友，或是同事同乡，熊希龄、谭延闿、范源廉、赵恒惕、蒋方震还是影响湘省乃至全国的大人物。在湘、在沪分设会计主任，一者为方便当下的教养，一者为方便将来留学海外，考虑长远而周全。另外，计划了两种筹款来源：一是国家恤金，二是同志及海内外义士赞助；三种善款保值增值方法：一是购置不动产，二是投资有价值之公股，三是储蓄于银行。梁启超的设计得到了谭延闿、熊希龄等的一致赞同，认为“允称协洽”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1917年4月17日，谭延闿来到设在长沙市陆军测绘局内的蔡公营葬事务所，参加蔡公遗孤教养协会会议。这是蔡公遗孤教养协会第一次实际运行，在湘的张孝准、石陶钧、曾继梧、范治焕、萧堃、袁家普、赵恒惕、刘庚先、陈复初、何鹏翔、唐巘、岳森等，大概率和蔡锷遗族一起参加了会议。会后，谭延闿将会议议定意见电告熊希龄，征求意见：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;筱日（编者注：即17日）蔡公遗孤教养协会开会，议决事项如下:一、山门地方财产归太夫人收用。二、新置省城及宝庆城内两处房屋地皮,归端生（即蔡端，作者注）兄弟所有。三、新旧动产,除提一万元为太夫人膳费外，其余各项股票及现金,概归端生兄弟所有。四、照蔡公生前之命,端生归夫人抚养，永宁归如夫人抚养,一切动产、不动产平均分管,不得变卖。五、调查旧账，分别清理。六、夫人、如夫人现暂同居分爨,当否?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;分配方案以蔡端、蔡永宁兄弟为中心，具有男尊女卑的时代色彩。山门地方财产在蔡家侨居的武冈县山门镇（今属洞口县），为年租十石的田产及旧屋一间。新置省城及宝庆城里两处房屋地产，一是长沙市南门外天鹅塘樟树园一号住宅，规模偏小；一是宝庆城内旧协署废址，在蔡锷逝世后由唐巘出面购买，原计划建筑蔡母养老住所，因资金不够尚未动工。财产的大头为湖南华昌矿业公司股份，其时炙手可热，一共34000元，其中5000元是三年前梁焕奎感念蔡锷劳苦功高无产而赠资代为购买的。当年旅长月薪高达2000银元，蔡家所有财产加起来不超过40000元，与同时代的地方大员相比，实显寒酸。其中第六条“夫人、如夫人现暂同居分爨”，印证了“其家事极纠纷”，显然让谭延闿也有点为难。此电见于《熊希龄先生遗稿》，应该同时发给了梁启超等人，只是其他人未保存而已。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;重后裔以报故人&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;护国运动胜利之后，依然是战争频仍、社会动荡、民生艰难，蔡家也大受影响。受国际局势等影响，纯锑价格急剧下降，湖南华昌矿业公司经过短暂繁荣之后，1918年即陷入困境，稍后破产。杨度、熊希龄等公司管理层还受到美国人的持续诉讼勒索，甚至被扣押。蔡家的重要资产湖南华昌矿业公司股份34000元，收取利息不到两年，一下全部血本无归。又受战争和灾害影响，蔡家田租、房租几乎绝收。世事艰难，协会同人也深受其害，但依然把关心扶持蔡锷遗孤的责任放在心上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1921年2月19日，在广东军政府的谭延闿致函石陶钧:“蔡公遗孤,吾辈必不能漠然置之。此间人太少，恐问心尚不如吾辈。弟谓吾辈当为拟定一办法乃佳，大众料无不赞同，公有何主张，望示也。”这是谭延闿给石陶钧的回信，面对蔡家财源枯竭的困境，石陶钧请求谭延闿设法救助，希望在广东找一条新路子，尽管谭延闿也想不出什么一劳永逸的办法，但责任意识、关切之情溢于言表。四年以后，石陶钧之子石潮白与蔡铸莲在上海结婚，随后一起留学日本，也算是对同乡好友的一个交代。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;敬启者,启超日前晤秉三、静生诸公，偶及蔡身后诸事，教育问题为吾辈应当特别注意事件外，对于遗族所置产业，既定为蔡公仰事俯蓄之资，自不能不有略思预防之法。查蔡公遗孤教养协会所有存款为数无多，只能专备教育经费，万难再移作别项之用。其遗族生活问题自不能不专于已置之产业，此项产业保存非有官方力为之巩固，难保不发生地痞侵蚀或滥用情事。协会同人自应力尽维持监督之责，则尊重功勋后裔者即所以报故人也。兹□合词函恳执事迅予刊发布告，令交蔡公产业所在地方官署，禁止买卖抵押，以资维护而重久远。言纫公谊，专此奉达，顺颂勋安。梁启超同启。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵恒惕曾经因反袁罹罪，经蔡锷救援得免，十分感恩，又是蔡公遗孤教养协会评议员，当即令蔡家原籍宝庆知事遵即贴张晓谕，俾众周知。也可见，梁启超、熊希龄、范源廉等一直没有忘记蔡锷和蔡家遗孤，常常努力设法维护。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1927年初，伴随北伐战争和民众运动发展，湘省收回租界收回领事裁判权运动、反军阀、惩治旧官僚绅士运动声势空前，省政府先后颁布《湖南省惩治土豪劣绅暂行条例》和《湖南省惩治贪官污吏暂行条例》，成立特别法庭、清查逆产委员会，查封、没收逆产运动波及全省。省清查逆产处对举报逆产者实行奖励，举报动产奖励没收数额的百分之二十，举报不动产奖励没收数额的百分之五。省总工会等团体积极推动，利用召开会员大会等大面积发放逆产调查表，大力鼓励举报逆产。唐巘名下有一座规模不小的房产，位于长沙市大东茅巷31号，被宣布为逆产，行将被没收为省矿业工会的办公楼。三日后，蔡端兄弟就此通电各界，大意是：该房产虽由唐家建筑，但各项权利已经转移到蔡家，理应归还。随即，在军界要人唐生智等人的过问下，此套房产被移出逆产名单。唐巘（1875-1929），字规严，宝庆人，留学日本期间加入同盟会，1905年归国后，先后担任广西陆军学堂主事、云南讲武堂主事，随后参加辛亥革命、护国运动，一直与蔡锷共进退，被蔡锷以兄视之，是护送蔡锷赴日就医的随员之一。之后，唐巘担任湘省政府财政司司长、省务院院长、省厘金局局长，是省长赵恒惕手下的要员，又担任过北洋政府财政部司长。军阀赵恒惕和北洋政府均是当时湘省要推翻打倒的，因为这层关系，唐巘名下产业，被列入逆产名单。两年后，唐巘在上海逝世，家人按照其遗愿将此房产捐给隔壁的仁术医院。可见，蔡端兄弟通电是为唐家友情援助，是社会对蔡锷遗孤的尊重保全了唐家的产业。在此前后，蔡锷二弟松垣私自用房产抵押借款而有意烂账，由蔡锷夫人刘侠贞出面登报称被人欺诈，并向警署报案。随即被对方揭穿，并在报纸上公开声明，不过仅登载三日即停，又是背后有要人干预，着意维护蔡锷遗族。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十几年来，梁启超通过倡行国葬、定期纪念、筹办松坡图书馆、为蔡母征寿诗等形式扩大影响，以关照蔡锷遗孤，去世前一两年还在家书里提到：“蔡松坡家里的人已经饿饭了，现在流离在上海”，自然又免不了设法救助。蒋方震在长沙期间，就居住在蔡锷家里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十年间，张孝准、范源廉、梁启超、唐巘、谭延闿相继故去，但是蔡公遗孤教养协会同人甚至圈外人士，从未放弃对蔡锷遗孤的帮助，情谊感人。 1931年6月，经张人杰等呈请，国民政府拨给蔡锷遗族年恤金800元，月给子女教育费400元，建祠补助5000元。蔡锷小女精神抑郁，一度在莫干山疗养，故旧部曲闻讯赠送钱财，帮助减小医疗费用压力。 1935年5月2日，蔡母王夫人在长沙逝世，各界要人纷纷函电吊慰，赠送不菲的赙仪，湘省当局筹办了盛大的葬礼，蔡家声誉达到了蔡锷国葬之后的最高点。大约在1950年，在朱德的安排下，蔡端、蔡永宁进入华北人民革命大学学习，随后分配了工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;一点遗憾和意外&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;蔡锷遗孤成长成才情况如何，公开的有关史料很少。根据一般的说法，除了夭折的蔡福莲之外，两男两女都是大学毕业，蔡端就读北平辅仁大学史学系，蔡永宁就读西南联大史学系，蔡淑莲就读浙江大学病虫害系，蔡铸莲还留学日本。据《北平辅仁大学校史》记载，1934年蔡端入北平辅仁大学史学系，1935年参加过一二·九和一二·一六反日示威运动并受伤，可见颇具少年豪气。北平辅仁大学是教会办的大学，师资和设备倶优，但学费昂贵，每学年400元左右，一般家庭根本负担不了。蔡锷遗孤教养协会同人和义士的关心，保障了四人超过常人的生活和教育水平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蔡端毕业后进入国民政府外交部工作，新中国成立后先后在全国政协文史资料研究委员会、光明日报社工作。蔡永宁先后在云南富滇银行、北京体育学院工作。蔡淑莲在云南昆明松坡中学任教。四人都受到了良好的高等教育，步入社会后获得一份还算体面的工作，可以说基本成人成才。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1946年下半年，蔡锷的同乡旧部雷飚将军在《国防月刊》连载长文《蔡松坡先生事略》，满怀深情详细回忆蔡锷的功业和品格，文末大发感叹甚至愤怒：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;惟其死后之家庭状况，亦有令人深为叹息不已者，身为上将军，家无立足地，老母在堂，两弟读书未成，寡妻幼子，教养无恃，虽蒙梁任公老师，由各方奠金项下凑集一二万金，聊作家庭暂时须用，而当民九、十年间，南北战事复起，原籍宝庆尤当冲要，其老母妻妾子女，终岁家无宁处，不得已分居云南、北京等处，而所蓄已尽，虽故友部曲，赠送有人，亦甚几希，最可耻者，有受惠最深，而代管各方所集之赠款，为遗孤养金者，不下数万元，一并吞灭之，不意护国军中，竟有如斯之人哉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1905年上半年，蔡锷任湖南教练处帮办兼湖南武备学堂、兵目学堂教习，雷飚是兵目学堂的学员，当年6月毕业后即随蔡锷赴桂，以后入滇入川，参加了辛亥革命和护国运动，一直担任重要军职。蔡锷离川之际，叮嘱雷飚掌握一支军队，支持省长戴戡。因为远在四川，又可能不为梁启超熟悉，所以没有参与蔡锷遗孤教养协会。雷飚作为蔡锷的同乡、学生、部下，以其身份和经历来看，所言应该基本可信。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蔡锷遗孤教养协会很多同人都参加了护国军，其中石陶钧、曾继梧、萧堃、刘庚先、何鹏翔、唐巘、岳森是和蔡锷交往更多的宝庆同乡，何鹏翔、唐巘还分别是蔡锷的副官长和秘书，从理论上说这些人都可能是雷飚所说的那个人。至于协会同人之外就难以猜测了。不过，时人普遍认为，石陶钧与蔡锷交往长久频繁，后来又成了儿女亲家，两家关系最为密切。李肖聃的《蔡锷别传》指出：“其同学石陶钧，为经纪其家事。”因此，雷飚暗指石陶钧的可能性很大。当然，这一切只是推测，到底真相如何，有待新的史料来证明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此一项集体义举，间杂个别人的私心劣行，不能不说是一个很大的遗憾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 10:25:13 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[最高人民检察院依法对杜兆才决定逮捕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258323]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 10:10:11&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;国家体育总局原党组成员、副局长杜兆才涉嫌受贿一案，由国家监察委员会调查终结，移送检察机关审查起诉。日前，最高人民检察院依法以涉嫌受贿罪对杜兆才作出逮捕决定。该案正在进一步办理中。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

When I signed up, I saw that it was full of people; when I went to the classroom, I saw that it was full of people. It&#39;s crowded. There were originally 40 people per class, but now it&#39;s almost 60. But what troubled my wife and me at first was whether the child should write with his left hand or with his right hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My son is left-handed, which is a minority. According to statistics, one in ten people is left-handed. There are many left-handers in our family. My mother, wife, and eldest daughter are all left-handed. According to this statistics, the majority of them reaches 60%. When my son followed me to write calligraphy and draw pictures, many people around me were surprised and said: &quot;Left hand!&quot; My wife and I are relatively consistent on this point and have never let him forcefully use his right hand. Therefore, when others are surprised, I will say to my son: Son, you can write in whichever hand you want. Dad will not force you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My son is very casual when he learns to write from me. But when I entered first grade, the problem of writing first surfaced again, as if it was back to when my eldest daughter was more than ten years ago. Because my daughter’s left hand writing was forcibly changed by her elementary school teacher, but she was not used to it at first, and then she changed to writing with her right hand. The left hand still took priority in doing other things, but the left hand could no longer write. Looking back on my daughter&#39;s experience of changing her right hand to write, the only difference is that when writing numbers and letters, there is a mirror image. Sometimes it is easy to make mistakes like b and d, but she gradually got used to it. For my son, I talked with the kindergarten teacher when he first started drawing with colored pens, and he has always used his left hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of the problem of left and right hands, I have checked a lot of information, but there are almost no accurate and scientifically verified answers. Is this a question to be studied or a pseudo-question that is not a question? It is worth thinking about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After searching on the Internet, many celebrities including Einstein and Bill Gates are left-handed. They are far away from us. The most famous one I know is Gao Fenghan, a Qing Dynasty painter and one of the Eight Eccentrics of Jiangnan. He has hundreds of square meters of exhibition area dedicated to his works in the Qingdao Museum. He is a famous writer who writes with his left hand, but I don&#39;t know if he is left-handed because he only used his left hand after his right hand became ill. The other is the local Nobel Prize winner Mo Yan. I often see him writing with his left hand, but I don’t know if he is left-handed, let alone whether his most famous works were inspired by his left hand or his right hand. Assuming that both of them are right-handed, there will be no problem writing with the right hand, and the left-handed person will naturally use the left hand. Of course, there will be no problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We live in a world where the right hand is used to writing, eating and doing things. Because the number of people is small, people are a little curious about people who do things with the left hand. From this perspective, the question of writing with the left hand or with the right hand is a social phenomenon, an indicator of social tolerance. When you are a minority, the only problem may be that you have to grow up in a different light, which is not easy. Although it is not easy, I still tend to let it take its course when it comes to my son&#39;s left hand writing. With a symmetrical human body structure, it is impossible to say which side has the advantage. Therefore, it is especially important to treat left-handers as normally and naturally as right-handers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I used to think that this issue would attract many parents to discuss it enthusiastically, but when I posted it in the class group, I got no response. After the first parent-teacher meeting in elementary school, I communicated with my child’s class teacher, and the answer I got surprised me: In my son’s class, among the 55 children, there was only one left-handed person who wrote. Of course, he was not the only one who was left-handed. I asked friends of all ages who are familiar with me, and the information I got was: a fourth-grade primary school student said that there was only one student in his class who wrote with his left hand; a second-grade primary school student said that there was no one in his class who wrote with his left hand; a third-grade primary school student said The head teacher told me that in her impression, among the many classes she taught, there was only one child who wrote with his left hand. It seems that the question of whether we use our left hand or our right hand has been entangled for a long time. For most people, it is not a problem at all, and of course there is no need to discuss it. Perhaps, parents had made a choice about this issue when they first started holding pens in kindergarten, or they may have struggled with it at that time, but most people chose the mainstream, that is, using their right hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children who are born left-handed are destined to be a minority among the crowd, and it seems that children who choose to write with their left hand can only be a minority among the minority in our small place. If you look at it from another angle, writing naturally with the hand that is most convenient for you is not a problem if you are left-handed and right-handed. But from the perspective of only looking at the left and right, especially the perspective that more people only look at the right hand, becoming a minority is indeed a challenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a son chooses to write with his right hand, it is also a challenge. It is challenging his physical limits. This is an individual issue; but choosing the left hand and choosing the minority is a psychological and social challenge. Children, although you are in the minority, hold on! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为山东高密市民）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（南方周末App“hi，南周”栏目期待您的来稿。投稿邮箱：nfzmreaders@163.com）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 09:25:13 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[卫星照片机械执法，晒谷场边的几棵树被砍了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258291]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Not long ago, I went back to my hometown for some time for some reason. One day, I received a call from the village cadre saying that several trees next to his own grain drying field outside the village needed to be cut down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are some poplar trees that my father planted next to the grain drying farm more than ten years ago. Although they were planted at the same time, several trees grew unevenly. The largest one was more than 30 centimeters in diameter at breast height and I couldn&#39;t wrap my arms around it, while the smallest one was no more than the width of a bowl. My mother said that maybe they were planted too densely, and the weaker ones couldn&#39;t compete with the stronger ones, so they grew slower and slower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After chatting with the village cadres for a while, I learned that cutting down trees was required by the superiors. This time, in addition to a few trees in my house, all the trees planted by villagers in nearby fields will be cut down: &quot;This time, all these trees in the fields south of the road must be cut down, and there is no bargaining.&quot; It is said that the County Land and Resources Bureau received satellite photos (&quot;satellite photos&quot;) sent by superiors, which circled many places in our county and said that these are cultivated lands, and those with trees must be cut down, and those with greenhouses must be demolished. All the land was restored to cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ordinarily, our trees grow beside the grain drying field and are not planted in the ground. Strictly speaking, the grain drying farm is agricultural facility land, not farmland. How did this small grain drying field with only a few dozen square meters turn into cultivated land? Maybe it’s because my parents have been in poor health in recent years and have farmed a lot less land. This drying field has basically not been used. It is covered with grass in summer, so it is regarded as cultivated land in the satellite film? Or maybe those who watched the satellite films didn&#39;t make a careful distinction at all, but just drew a random picture and concluded that all the land south of a certain road was cultivated land, and if it was changed to other uses, it would be restored? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, such problems are not uncommon in the process of &quot;satellite film law enforcement&quot;. More than half a month ago, a doctoral student from the School of Social Sciences of Wuhan University also mentioned a similar issue in an article. The superior land and resources department determines land use based on the changes in the &quot;patterns&quot; of satellite photos over the past few years. If it is found that the original cultivated land has turned into forests or houses have been built, it will issue a notice asking the local government to &quot;enforce the law&quot; and return the land to farming. But the problem is that the use of some land is more complicated and has changed many times in history. Just looking at satellite images without carefully studying the nature of the land and its changes can easily lead to problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And due to the insufficient resolution of the satellite images used in land surveys in previous years, some relatively small roads and other construction lands were not identified and were all classified as cultivated land. Nowadays, with technology upgrades, satellite photos The resolution has been greatly improved, and the road in the middle of the farmland could be distinguished. However, it turned out that it was considered illegal to occupy land for road construction and needed to be rectified. Just like my family&#39;s grain-drying field, it was also zoned as cultivated land, and the trees planted next to it had to be cut down. These mechanical &quot;law enforcement&quot; that do not study the actual situation and only look at pictures on satellite films, the pressure is directly transmitted to the grassroots, and conflicts between cadres and farmers are commonplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our county, due to the reduction of rural population and lack of labor force, a lot of land cannot be cultivated. Moreover, most of the land in our village is hilly and sloping, and it is difficult to divert water for irrigation. We basically rely on the sky for food, and the harvest from farming is not high. For farmers, switching to planting trees may not bring much income from selling trees, but at least they don’t have to work hard every year. A few years ago, the government also encouraged afforestation and even provided subsidies for planting trees, so some villages also planted trees on their farmland. Nowadays, it is necessary to &quot;return forests to farmland&quot; and cut down all the trees that are just about to become useful. This will naturally harm the interests of farmers and cause many people to not understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are indeed some good lands, and it is a pity to plant trees. For example, the neighboring village has thousands of acres of flat land beside a small river. There is water in the river. It was the &quot;irrigated land&quot; that everyone envied back then, and it was very suitable for growing wheat and corn. Later, these lands were also planted with trees. When I passed by my hometown a few years ago, I felt quite emotional. These patches of cultivated land have good soil quality and water for irrigating, and large agricultural machinery can be used to reduce manpower. Perhaps after the cultivated land is restored, it can be collectively contracted to large households for growing food through circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the barren mountainous land in our village, even if it is converted back to cultivated land, there will be no one in the village who can cultivate it. After all, the more than 200 people who still stay in the village all year round are mostly six-year-olds. For a seventy-year-old man, these fragmented lands are difficult to carry out large-scale mechanized farming. Even if all the trees are cut down, the final result is likely to be abandoned. So what’s the point of cutting down trees and “still plowing”? Will we spend money to hire people to grow food in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, although there are doubts, the old people in the village are relatively honest, and most of them will not delve into it. If it says it needs to be cut, then just do it. After all, cutting down trees is now the task of the village cadres, and many of the villagers are related to the village cadres, or at least they are neighbors who never see each other without looking up. The villagers do not want to make it too difficult for them. It&#39;s not worth breaking up for a few trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the village cadres, there were also two businessmen from nearby villages who specialized in cutting down and buying trees. They negotiated the price on the spot, and they would come to cut down the trees and take them away the next day. There was no need to sell the trees in the whole process. People worry. However, since trees are being cut down everywhere now, the price is naturally much cheaper. A few years ago, someone offered 200 yuan to buy the largest tree, but my mother thought the price was too low and refused to sell it. Now, the five trees can only be sold for 200 yuan in total. This was because the person who bought the tree was an acquaintance from my mother’s natal village and was given a preferential price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子称学信网显示“结业”错失高薪工作：学历问题事关诚信，理应严肃以待丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258303]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, an &quot;academic qualification news&quot; has attracted attention. According to the &quot;Yangtze Evening News&quot; report, Ms. Lu from Shanghai reported that Hunan Normal University issued her a graduation certificate and degree certificate when she graduated as an undergraduate, but the Xuexin website showed that she had graduated, which led to the company she was applying for doubting when she changed jobs. He made false claims and failed to pass the review, missing out on a job opportunity with a monthly salary of more than 40,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Lu said that the school refused to change back to graduation status because her Mandarin scores were unsatisfactory at that time. &quot;But when she graduated in 2002, the major did not have this requirement at all.&quot; In June 2023, Ms. Lu will Hunan Normal University went to court and asked the school to change its Xuexin.com status to graduated. On October 6, the school refused to mediate before trial. The Changsha Railway Transport Court determined that Ms. Lu graduated in 2002, which exceeded the maximum prosecution period for administrative litigation, and dismissed the lawsuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The matter has evolved to this point, and public opinion is mostly on the side of the woman involved. A closer look at this incident reveals that there are still many details that need to be analyzed one by one before a correct conclusion can be drawn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, judging from the time when this case is presented, there are still many factual issues that need to be determined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main reason for the prosecution and defense of the woman involved is that she received the graduation certificate and degree certificate issued by the school, and she graduated early; the school should not use the &quot;Putonghua test failed to meet the standard&quot; as an excuse to use the Xuexin.com The status was changed from &quot;graduated&quot; to &quot;completed&quot; because she was not a teacher major and should not have this graduation requirement; the court&#39;s determination of the prosecution period should be adjusted to start when she &quot;learned of the prosecution period&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The issue of &quot;early graduation&quot; and the woman involved&#39;s two certificates are the basic facts that need to be clarified urgently in this case. As we all know, those who are eligible to apply for early graduation must have completed all courses with excellent results within three years, completed the defense of their graduation thesis, and must also meet other graduation requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the graduation certificate and degree certificate published in media reports, the woman in question did indeed obtain these two paper certificates issued in June 2002. So, did the woman in question, who enrolled in school in 1999, &quot;leave school on her own initiative&quot; or &quot;graduate early&quot; in 2002? Does the non-teaching major she majored in when she left school have a Mandarin test as a graduation requirement? What procedural problems occurred between the time the woman in question obtained the two certificates and the time when the school uploaded the status to the Xuexin.com as &quot;graduated&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the school’s defense reasons, the school gave two explanations. First, the woman’s Mandarin test scores were not up to standard, so she could only upload “graduation” on the Xuexin website; The two certificates in the woman&#39;s hands &quot;were found to be not issued by the school in accordance with procedures,&quot; and there were procedural issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There may be two possibilities: one is that the woman in question had no problem in obtaining the two certificates, but the school refused to upload the correct information to the Xuexin website; the other is that the two certificates in the hands of the woman in question were There is a problem with the certificate. If the application is issued in violation of regulations or is issued incorrectly, the school will only &quot;come to its senses&quot; after the fact, so it can only correct it when uploading information to Xuexin.com. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the school needs to respond to the following questions: Since graduation certificates and degree certificates were not issued in accordance with procedures, who was responsible for issuing the certificates at that time? What means did the woman in question use to obtain two illegal certificates? Afterwards, since the school realized that the two certificates were not in compliance with the procedures, why did it not notify the woman in time and take back the certificate, and only found a replacement on the Xuexin website? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the student status files during college, the memories of teachers and classmates, the original transcript that the woman in question claimed to have in her hand, the school’s official graduation requirements for non-teaching majors at the time, and the actions of the school’s degree evaluators at the time, obtained It is not too difficult to obtain sufficient written and oral evidence to distinguish right from wrong. If this case enters the second instance, both parties will need to rely on these original evidences to piece together the full story of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the issue of information uploaded on Xuexin.com also deserves further clarification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the administrative ruling provided by the court, the woman involved claimed that “checking through the Xuexin.com showed completion instead of graduation, the date of birth was registered incorrectly and the degree certificate information was not uploaded.” . Judging from the screenshots reported by the media, the woman in question was born on June 8, while the information on Xuexin Online stated that she was born on June 11. Such errors of month and day will inevitably leave the outside world with the impression that the school is sloppy. This is something the school needs to explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, we should also ask, when did the school upload the information from Xuexin.com? Why was the woman involved not notified in time when uploading the information on Xuexin.com? Public information shows that Xuexin.com &quot;completed the construction of the higher education academic qualifications database since 1991&quot; in October 2003. If the woman involved learned about the time limit for prosecution, the reason for rejection was &quot;the twenty-year prosecution period has expired&quot; There are areas worth debating. At least it should be clear about the exact time when the school uploads the information to Xuexin.com so that the court can determine the time limit for prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, this incident caused some waves in the public opinion field. Some people believe that even if the woman in question really just graduated, since she can find a high-paying job based on her skills, it would be too harsh to have her employment affected by her academic qualifications from 20 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This argument received a lot of support. However, although the importance of academic qualifications cannot be generalized, it does have its significance and value on different occasions and at various time points. In fact, employers vary widely, and so do the personal circumstances of applicants. If the person concerned has a problem with his or her academic qualifications and has not encountered any obstacles to employment in the past, it does not mean that an employer that is willing to provide a high-paying job will not happen to take advantage of this. Employers have greater discretion over whether and how important an applicant&#39;s academic qualifications are, not to mention that falsification involves integrity issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, many details of this case are murky, and both the woman involved and the school need stronger evidence for their arguments. The issue of academic qualifications is a matter of integrity and should be taken seriously. Now that this case has become a public issue, it is necessary for the school to conduct an in-depth investigation into this academic qualifications incident, produce more original evidence, restore the truth, set the record straight, and respond to external concerns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[高铁超员报警无法发车，广州南站通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258313]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;[Explanation on the online overcrowding alarm of G541 train]&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 October On March 6, the G541 train from Zhengzhou East to Guangzhou South arrived at Shaoguan Station.

I always feel very awkward, because when we were studying, the word &quot;jiá&quot; was the original word for &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;jiá&quot;. Check &quot;Chinese Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Chinese Dictionary&quot; and you will find that this word is not polyphonic even now. Only when the word &quot;口&quot; is added next to it, can you pronounce &quot;GA [ɡā]&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s different now. The &quot;Modern Chinese Dictionary&quot; probably started from the 6th edition (I don’t have an earlier version at hand), and added the sound ɡā to this word. There is only one meaning below: &quot;Cannes (ɡā&amp;nbsp ;nà), French place name.&quot; This means that as a transliterated word, &quot;ɡā&amp;nbsp;nà&quot; can be pronounced loudly and openly. If you correct this reading, you are wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, this is a double misunderstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Cannes International Film Festival (Cannes International Film Festival) is named after the place where it is held. According to the principle of following the owner, it is translated as Cannes. It is the translation closest to the French pronunciation, which is translated as &quot;Cannes&quot; , it’s too far away to be measured. This was originally an error made by the translators at that time in determining the translation name due to lack of audio-visual information. Checking the newspaper database of the Republic of China, there was a news report in the &quot;Central Daily News&quot; on August 18, 1944, &quot;France occupied nine towns eight miles deep, and the Allies took control of Cannes and forced Toulon.&quot; It can be seen that this translation has a long history, but At that time, more news items used &quot;Cancheng&quot;, which shows that newspapers in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China put a lot of effort into reviewing and naming. Unfortunately, later generations chose the mistranslated one. &quot;Modern Chinese Dictionary&quot;, as a dictionary that takes normativeness as its own responsibility, should not use &quot;convention&quot; (not &quot;custom&quot;) as &quot;I follow the crowd&quot; (not necessarily &quot;the crowd&quot;) on the basis of mistranslation. As an excuse, he proposed a new pronunciation for the word &quot;Jia&quot; that has no basis in literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;General British and American people are probably confused about the pronunciation of the place name Cannes. In 2013, the Fox TV station with the highest ratings in the United States (the audience is mainly American &quot;red necks&quot;) once launched a Twitter Based on a small investigation, the reporter combined the discussions among fans and wrote a very humorous short article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/how-to-pronounce-cannes-cans-can-or- con&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;u>;How to pronounce Cannes: Cans, can or con? | Fox News&lt;/u>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;, the conclusion is that it should be pronounced &quot;Kan&quot;, and the pronunciation is between English between the words can and ken. The online pronunciation of &quot;Cambridge English Dictionary&quot; is the same as when can is stressed:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/cannes&quot;>;&lt; span>;&lt;u>;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/cannes&lt;/u>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can predict with the &quot;Modern Chinese Dictionary&quot; &quot;With the blessing of &quot;Cannes (ɡā&amp;nbsp;nà)&quot;, the translation of &quot;Cannes (ɡā&amp;nbsp;nà)&quot;, which is &quot;uniquely made in Cannes&quot;, is bound to become popular, and all efforts to block the car will &quot;come to an abrupt end&quot;. No matter how reluctant you are, I am afraid you can only make mistakes. &quot;Gaga&quot; started to learn the language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
