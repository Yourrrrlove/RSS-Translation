On the one hand: understanding that genuine editions protect the rights of writers. On the other hand, he said: Just like Teacher Yu Hua said, &quot;My books should be pirated.&quot; He is not supporting piracy, but he really hopes that at that moment he can stand up to protect a reader&#39;s love for him; the more he thinks about it, the more sad he becomes. , the more I admire Teacher Yu Hua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Ma Boyong himself responded: I really can’t sign pirated books. After all, I haven’t reached the level of Teacher Yu Hua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident is undoubtedly a storm in a tea cup, but there is indeed something to interpret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is normal for different writers to have different views on their books being pirated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The occurrence of piracy is often a reflection of &quot;book sales&quot; and &quot;popular works&quot;. In this sense, piracy is a writer&#39;s medal. It can even be said: How can one be called a &quot;writer&quot; if he has never been pirated? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, writer Yu Hua’s words are contextual and cannot be understood as support and endorsement of piracy. He said this on at least two public occasions. Once he said: &quot;I never fight against piracy. There is mainly such a poor consumer group. They also want to read, so they buy a few cheap pirated books... If this problem is not solved, my books will be pirated. It should be&quot;; another said: &quot;It is right that my book should be pirated, because at least it is better than food safety. You solve the food safety problem and then solve the piracy problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time Yu Hua said this, the focus was not on piracy, but on a specific social issue. The first time was &quot;poor consumer groups&quot; and the second time was &quot;food safety.&quot; In fact, if the losses caused by piracy are not huge but the cost of settlement is high, expressing your attitude and gaining reputation in this way is also the right choice. After all, a good reputation is a very important asset for a producer of spiritual products. Moreover, he believes that the &quot;piracy problem&quot; needs to be solved, and does not believe that &quot;piracy is justified&quot; or &quot;piracy is justified.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s understandable even if the author himself hates his books being pirated. Pirated copies are far cheaper than genuine copies. On the one hand, this allows people who cannot afford genuine copies to afford them and satisfy their intellectual and spiritual needs. On the other hand, it also makes some readers who would otherwise buy genuine copies buy pirated copies instead. Piracy with typos has long been a thing of the past. Today’s authentic photocopies, electronic versions, or electronic print versions have almost no difference in reading experience from the original version. This will affect the sales of the original version and harm the interests of publishers and authors. There are even some sales channels that mix genuine copies with pirated copies, and the latter is more profitable. Many readers spend the price of genuine copies to buy pirated copies. This is essentially a form of fraud, and it also infringes upon those who were kept in the dark. Reader Rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, on this basis, how to clarify the right and wrong of this incident? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For an extremely successful best-selling author like Ma Boyong, he has no problem with being averse to piracy. In his response, he said that he felt sorry for the readers who unknowingly bought pirated copies. In the past, he would spend his own money to buy more than a dozen books to keep. If he found out that the readers had pirated copies, he would give them a genuine copy, but later the pirated copies were really It is so rampant that sometimes nearly 1/3 of the books brought by authors on site are pirated copies. It was embarrassing and burdensome, so I changed the method and set up on-site genuine sales. Readers who accidentally bought a pirated copy can buy a new one. &quot;You don&#39;t have to queue up again, just come to me to sign it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Readers who spend time and money to get autographs from authors should do so because they particularly like the author and his works, and generally do not intentionally buy pirated books. Therefore, most of the readers who brought pirated books thought they were cheated by the channels and bought pirated copies with genuine money. Therefore, both arrangements before and after are decent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the on-site staff really &quot;scolded&quot; the uncle who signed the pirated book, then the only thing worth improving is the attitude issue. This type of signing event is usually organized by publishing houses. It is possible that the staff of the publishing house will be angry when they see such a high proportion of pirated books and the interests of the publishing house being infringed upon. In this sense, even if Ma Boyong is particularly generous, it is inappropriate to accept pirated books and sign them all, because this is generosity to others and detrimental to the interests of the publishing house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, how do you view writers as producers of spiritual products and their pursuit of material interests? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A gentleman loves money and gets it in a wise way. In theory, this principle applies to any profession, but producers of spiritual products are indeed very different from producers of material products, and reputation and reputation are much more important. Readers as consumers have two special psychological expectations for the former. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, especially for an author who is a spiritual mentor, readers will expect him to conform to the image of a wise man or a saint: the best image is to be immortal, with a transcendent and elegant air, and in moral terms You are a lot higher than the world, at least you can&#39;t show your love for money or greed for material benefits, because if you are as &quot;tacky&quot; as me, what else do you have that I can admire and look up to? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Boyong’s response obviously understood the reader’s psychology. He did not explain why he disliked piracy, nor did he clarify whether there was any “scolding”. He only said that “it is inevitable to be negligent in doing things, and there will always be mistakes.” A satisfactory place&quot;, and spend a lot of space on empathizing with the reader, telling how he enjoys the interaction with the reader, &quot;treating the reader as a friend&quot;, and demonstrating that he is not materialistic. This is an effective way to protect his reputation. Act of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, for producers of spiritual products, readers will expect their behavior to be consistent with the values ​​expressed in books or in public. If a writer promotes a high moral standard or expresses a certain value tendency in a book, but fails to achieve it or does not do it consistently in practice, or is perceived as such by readers, then the reader may turn from love to hate, or from fans to fans. black. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen said, &quot;The writer who likes little people the most and is good at portraying little people has also become a big shot after becoming famous.&quot; &quot;I bought an umbrella on the road, but my heart was already wet.&quot; He knows the truth of &quot;piracy is wrong&quot;, but whether it is true love no longer or misunderstanding or wrong love, this feeling is extremely real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[五星评分打底的宣传，就这？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260484]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;If you are a director and the screenwriter writes How would you shoot a rape scene? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should we use a large aperture to focus on the victim&#39;s painful face and the perpetrator&#39;s twisted body, or should we use a blurred lens to express violence with a line of blood, a cry of pain, and an angry and struggling hand? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you were a director, how would you show the pain of a single mother who lost her only daughter and did not hesitate to die with her enemies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should I express my mother’s feelings without any elaboration and use a few sensational lines and music, or should I express my anger at my daughter’s stigmatization, my despair at the distorted truth, and my sudden uncertainty about my future life? Hopelessly complicated mentality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think about these two questions for a moment, you can understand the problem of the new film &quot;Rescuing Suspect&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/76d97e67a4f527fd1014fe0ec6ed7492.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1512&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/76d97e67a4f527fd1014fe0ec6ed7492.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258041&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This film is produced by Directed by Zhang Yimou&#39;s daughter Zhang Mo, it is a remake of the Korean movie &quot;Seven Days&quot;. The original work was not a good work, and the remake failed to make the story interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie is about a gold medal lawyer played by Zhang Xiaofei. After her daughter is kidnapped, she receives a mysterious phone call asking her to defend a criminal suspect. If she wins, her daughter will live, and if she loses, she will be killed. In order to save her daughter, she had no choice but to get involved, check the suspect&#39;s information, explore the life of the deceased woman, and then the entire case came to light. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that the choice of this subject was driven by female directors aiming at female stories. It’s a pity that we don’t see tenderness and empathy for female characters in the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, the intertwining of light and dark aspects of human nature and the gaps between love and hate in interpersonal relationships are where the tension lies in the story, but in this film, these are all ignored. The director likes to focus the camera on the emotional reactions of the characters, making them gasp, cry, anxious, have tears in their eyes, or have gloomy eyes. They like to use slow motion to show the somatic characteristics of people in pain. However, as for the undercurrents beneath these waves, But he didn&#39;t care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c8e979e942e077ea8429669a3b1036ae.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;487&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c8e979e942e077ea8429669a3b1036ae.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258040&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years There are a large number of female creators who constantly surprise us, such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge in &quot;Fleabag&quot; and Shao Yihui in &quot;The Myth of Love&quot;. They are all good at listening to the footsteps of their characters. Next, they bring their insight into the character&#39;s heart, their subtle description of desire, and their empathy for pain and separation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These perspectives are subtle and gentle, illuminating the hearts of the audience. Therefore, I am particularly looking forward to a female director remaking this story. Coupled with the constant positive reviews from the pre-release publicity, I expect her to be able to show the grief and indignation of a mother who is stunned, painful, resentful, regretful, and helpless, and finally goes to despair. This is a tragedy taking shape, and it also allows the audience to step on the edge of the protagonist&#39;s heart and resonate with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, the film did not record the footsteps of the tragedy. Without the sound of footsteps, the movie lacks the power to evoke emotions and thinking, just like a small cool drama mass-produced on a short video platform. However, it is also doubtful whether this film can really achieve the purpose of pleasing the audience like these low-cost, fast-produced dramas, because its pace is slow, and the twists are cliched and lack logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/fc2bc6cfbeff05c167b9868cf15b736e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;492&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/fc2bc6cfbeff05c167b9868cf15b736e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258039&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this The narrative completion that only stays at the visual excitement and superficial twists is almost a kind of surrender by the director: I can&#39;t understand the characters, I can&#39;t figure out the story, this is the only way I can go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know whether this is the director’s lack of confidence in his own expressive ability, or his habit of shooting movies as short videos: plots that do not ask for logic, emotions that are not patiently laid out, all the effort is spent on Play with various camera moves and reversals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard more than one person complain that movies in recent years, including Hollywood blockbusters, have become more and more short videos. There is a group of people who no longer want to film real stories, abandon the core &quot;people&quot; of the story, and choose to fill the audience&#39;s stomach with potato chips, popcorn and Coke. Therefore, popular hot words, amplified emotions, and reversal techniques are their operating formulas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/8cc113799c717260831859c21a4d1fb7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;489&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/8cc113799c717260831859c21a4d1fb7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258042&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend There are of course practical factors behind it. For example, viewers who are anxious about survival have reduced mental strength, no longer have the ability to empathize with others, and only desire quick emotional satisfaction. The creators followed suit, and film and television fast-moving consumer goods became very popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, responsible creators will still try to pull the tired audience out of the small world and tell them that Coca-Cola potato chips cannot provide real nutrition, and they will ultimately not be able to fill the empty hearts of adults. We need to go into the broader story and identify the emotional antidote that suits us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writing this, I originally wanted to avoid discussing the family background of the director of this film, but when I thought about it, it had close to 10% of the film schedule at the beginning of its release, the promotion of a five-star rating, and Hui Yinghong, Actors like Zhang Xiaofei can&#39;t help but think of the words of supermodel Victoria Ceretti against Depp&#39;s daughter:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Please don&#39;t compare yourself to me. I don&#39;t have a rich father. We Ordinary girls in this industry have to use their own efforts to gain everyone&#39;s respect. It doesn&#39;t mean that you can succeed by lying on the sofa of a mansion in Malibu.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being born in Rome is a blessing, not a mistake. . But after enjoying resources that most outstanding creators cannot enjoy, only handing in such an answer sheet will inevitably make people feel complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专家解答：得了支原体肺炎需要输液、“洗肺”吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260480]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, mycoplasma pneumonia in children has attracted widespread attention. When is a child contagious? Do I need infusion or &quot;lung washing&quot;? Worried about whether the hospital can be self-administered due to the large number of people in the hospital? On the occasion of World Pneumonia Day on November 12, the reporter interviewed relevant medical experts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After being infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, there is an incubation period of several days before the onset of fever, at which time the patient is contagious to a certain extent.” Zhou Wei, deputy chief physician of pediatrics at Peking University Third Hospital, said that wearing a mask can It can prevent infection to a certain extent, but it is not realistic for children to wear masks strictly and regularly. Going less often to crowded closed public places, ventilating the house frequently, regularly cleaning and disinfecting schools, and increasing outdoor activities are all helpful in preventing infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is infusion the best treatment for mycoplasma pneumonia? Zhou Wei said that some parents believe that intravenous infusion is better than oral treatment, but in fact there is no such conclusion. Treatment should be selected based on the child&#39;s condition. Children with severe pneumonia can choose intravenous infusion, while most children with mild illness can be treated with oral medications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;lung washing&quot; operation that parents are worried about, Zhou Wei said, &quot;This year, more children with mycoplasma pneumonia are indeed undergoing lung lavage treatment. Lung lavage has strict operating indications, such as patients with If the child develops atelectasis, local consolidation, or even very serious inflammatory reactions such as necrosis and sputum plug formation, lung lavage may need to be performed under a bronchoscope to unblock the airway, and it can also be seen under the microscope. To the extent of lung disease.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to mycoplasma, bacteria and viruses can also cause pneumonia. Ye Huan, director of the Respiratory Department of Beijing Chest Hospital, reminded that pneumonia patients often have typical symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, and young children and the elderly should pay special attention to precautions. It is recommended that people over 65 years old and children get the pneumonia vaccine. Although there is currently no vaccine against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the pneumonia vaccine can prevent a variety of pneumococci. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts remind that for pneumonia caused by different pathogens, the medication choices are also different. For example, for mycoplasma pneumonia, penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics are ineffective, and macrolide antibiotics are the most commonly used. Patients who are suspected of being infected with pneumonia should seek medical treatment in a timely manner and receive targeted treatment after diagnosis, and avoid blind medication such as &quot;self-administration of antibiotics&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为何总有体育馆塌顶：暴雪之下掩藏多少行业沉疴]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260478]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 20:27:34&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 7, 2023, Yuecheng Stadium after the roof collapsed.

Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within more than a hundred days, two stadium roof collapse accidents occurred in Qiqihar City and Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province, killing 11 and 3 people respectively, including 13 minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 23, 2023, the night of the Qiqihar accident, Heilongjiang quickly organized and carried out safety inspections of various schools and public welfare sports venues. The main leaders of Jiamusi Huanan County went to Yuecheng Gymnasium the next day Observe on the spot. 105 days later, on November 6, Jiamusi ushered in the first snow before winter. In the gymnasium where the leaders had implemented safety production requirements, tragedy happened again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are not the only two cases of large-span roof collapse. Southern Weekend reporters found that there have been many steel structure roof collapse accidents in recent years: In April 2022, the roof of a swimming pool collapsed in Zhengzhou, Henan, causing 3 deaths and 9 injuries; in November 2021, the light steel structure roof of a project in Jinhua, Zhejiang collapsed, causing 6 deaths and 6 injuries; in March 2021, a grid roof collapsed at a construction site in Qingdao, Shandong, causing 1 death and 7 injuries; in May 2019, the roof of a steel structure building collapsed in Baise, Guangxi, causing 6 deaths and 87 injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not unique to China. Wang Luchuan (pseudonym), an expert in engineering accident research and former chief engineer of Beijing Urban Construction Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that roof collapse accidents of large-span structures are a common problem in buildings around the world. According to the cases he knows, stadium collapses have occurred in France, the United States, and Canada. ACCIDENT. “Currently there are relatively few cases of stadium collapse in China.” Wang Luchuan emphasized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many stadium roof collapse accidents point to the design form of fragile long-span steel structures. How did it change from a popular architectural style to the &quot;Sword of Damocles&quot; hanging above people&#39;s heads? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reduce costs, reduce loads&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 6, 2023, netizens focused their attention on the roof of the Jiamusi stadium that collapsed just five years after it was built. According to Xinhua News Agency, The roof structure of the stadium is an H-shaped variable-section steel beam structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang, chief engineer of Chengdu Southeast Steel Structure Co., Ltd., has 19 years of relevant experience. He told Southern Weekend reporters that this structure is called a portal steel frame structure in the industry, that is, doors made of H-shaped steel The structure can form a span of 20 to 30 meters, so there is no need to set up many columns. It is usually used in the design of small gymnasiums and factory buildings. &quot;The gymnasium in Jiamusi covers an area of ​​675 square meters, and the portal structure still matches the overall structure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This structure itself has no problems, it is simple and simple, and it is a relatively mature structural system.” Liu Yonggang explained that the steel structure has good toughness and high strength, and it can be built like building blocks. It can be built quickly and achieve good architectural effects. &quot;It is excellent in itself, but if it is not used properly, problems will occur.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang introduced that the first step to make good use of steel structures is design, and the first step in design is selection. There are many structural forms that can meet the long-span function, such as portal structure, grid structure, truss structure, etc. Among them, the portal steel frame structure uses the least amount of steel, and its processing and installation technology is relatively simple, so it is also one of these three structures. The cheapest among the structures. The stadium that collapsed in Jiamusi this time was a portal structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the type is selected, the next step is to calculate the load. Different load values ​​determine the amount of steel used and the compressive resistance of the building. In the Northeast region, in addition to the conventional wind loads, live loads, seismic loads, dust loads, etc. that need to be considered, the building design codes have additional provisions for the frequent heavy snow weather, that is, increasing the snow load. At the same time, in order to make it easier for snow to slide down, the roof slope is usually designed to be larger, but the increase in slope also means an increase in the cost. Photos of the interior of the Jiamusi Yuecheng Gymnasium circulated online show that the roof supported by H-shaped steel beams has a smaller slope, which means that the roof is easier to accumulate snow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether a building is designed safely is related to the designer’s personal expertise and experience, as well as the owner’s budget and requirements. Liu Yonggang introduced that designers from large design institutes will be more professionally persistent. For example, if they want to design a satisfactory and strong building, they will superimpose and evaluate all unfavorable factors, and then the designed plan will be relatively conservative, and the amount of steel used will naturally be higher. Increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For some owners who pursue maximizing profits and repaying their capital as soon as possible, &quot;obedient&quot; small design institutes are their first choice. &quot;Some owners are looking for costs. They will say, save me a little more, reduce the amount of steel used, and laymen will guide experts. Some small design institutes also want to survive, so they will try to figure out the load and meet the specifications. The limit.&quot; Liu Yonggang said. Yuecheng Gymnasium was designed by Jiamusi Architectural Design Institute. Liu Yonggang said that this design institute is a relatively small design institute. “It’s just that the design institute is small and it is not clear whether the design experience is sufficient.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The redundancy of this kind of stadium building design is too low. If you pile something on it, it will collapse. If you spend 100 yuan to keep it from collapsing, then you are willing to spend 101 Yuan, or are you willing to spend 200 Yuan?&quot; Wang Luchuan said frankly that he could understand, &quot;It is unlikely that the redundancy of such a long-span roof will be particularly high, so the cost will be too high. Like a bridge, an additional 10 % redundancy may increase the cost by 50%. But it cannot be given too low. It is really unjustifiable if it collapses in 5 years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 7, 2023, the person in charge of Yuecheng Sports Club and others have been controlled by the police.

Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“People don’t know goods, money knows goods”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, even having a perfect design plan does not guarantee the safety of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang, a professor at the School of Civil Engineering of Southeast University, wondered why a gymnasium that had just been built five years ago collapsed. &quot;The first five years are the best period for the house. It is impossible not to consider the snow load when designing. But if it collapses at this time, the problem is still quite big.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that if there are no problems with the design drawings, then Is the construction quality strictly controlled: &quot;For example, does the purchased steel meet the strength requirements, is the construction section strictly in accordance with the drawing requirements, and is the weld quality qualified?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the industry situation, in the steel components Quality risks may also exist in the processing and manufacturing process. Liu Yonggang introduced that some small processing plants only have two or three machines and can invest hundreds of thousands of yuan to process, but they often do not have standardized management structures, quality management systems and safety production systems to control product quality. &quot;For example, after the factory buys the steel plate from the steel factory, it cuts it into pieces with a flame, and then welds it to form each steel component. During processing, if the hole is punched out of place, it needs to be cut larger with a flame. This will damage the steel and shorten its original service life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regular enterprises have a complete management system. Liu Yonggang took his own company as an example, &quot;When we buy steel plates, we need to detect and inspect them. After they are processed into steel components, we have to inspect them ourselves and ask a third party to inspect them before they can leave the factory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On-site installation also requires attention to quality control. During the installation process, if the operation is not standardized, it will also cause quality defects and the designed service life will not be reached. &quot;Installation is equivalent to the final assembly of a car, which means bringing the processed steel components to the site for installation. It is best to have professionals do professional work.&quot; Liu Yonggang said that some irregular construction units bring a group of migrant workers to work, &quot; I was still farming yesterday, and tomorrow I will install the steel structure. If the accuracy of one place is not adjusted well, I will start the next step of installation, and it will be cut again and again, and errors will accumulate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Optimization&quot; is also a common problem during the construction process. Feng Ruoqiang said that in order to make more money, a construction unit that won the bid &quot;optimized&quot; the design height of the steel beam from 600 mm to 400 mm and the wall thickness of the steel beam from 20 mm to 12 mm during construction. In order to save labor in the welding process, low-level welders are used to replace good welders with high wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang believes that winning bids at low prices is the direct cause of the &quot;optimization&quot; trend in the industry. He found that the bidding prices of large companies are about 20% higher than that of small companies, mainly reflected in management costs, raw material costs and installation costs. “Our industry association also makes suggestions to the general contractor and the government, hoping that the price will not be lowered again and again. If the price is too low, if a small company does it, there will be problems such as &#39;optimization&#39;, cutting corners, etc., and ultimately it will be &#39;profitable&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is difficult to change. &quot;The difficulty now is still money. In order to put into production as soon as possible, the owner requires you to rush for work hours and save costs. Including government investment, it is also reducing costs. As long as you don&#39;t choose the cheap one, you have made a mistake. People don&#39;t know the goods. , money knows the goods.&quot; Liu Yonggang sighed with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Don&#39;t kill yourself&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sports venues designed and constructed in accordance with national standards cannot &quot;sit back and relax.&quot; In the specific use stage, safety mainly depends on the owner&#39;s consciousness, and there are no national mandatory standards. &quot;If a sports venue cannot be used correctly, it is prone to problems. During use, do not use it indiscriminately. People cannot go on the roof but you have to go up. There are no other loads on the roof but some additional loads are added.&quot; Many interviewed experts told Southern Weekend reporters The collapse of Qiqihar No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium was caused by more human factors. Its roof structure was called a bolted ball grid structure. Due to the illegal stacking of water-absorbing perlite, the load was excessive and suddenly collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Qiqihar Stadium is a typical example of improper use.” Feng Ruoqiang believes that during the blizzard weather when the Yuecheng Stadium collapsed, “As an operator, you either close the stadium or pay extra attention. During the use phase Operators must have sufficient safety awareness, which is very important.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among building materials such as concrete, steel structures, and aluminum alloys, steel structures have a fatal weakness, which is its corrosion problem. It is more susceptible to oxidation. After oxidation, the performance of the material will be greatly reduced. Many collapse accidents are caused by corrosion of steel structures. Therefore, the maintenance of steel structure houses is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The steel structures we build need to be repainted every 10 to 15 years, and the bolts must be checked to see if they have fallen off. We will recommend that owners perform annual maintenance, or conduct major inspections every few years, and deal with problems as soon as possible if they are found. Liu Yonggang said, but now many steel structure buildings are difficult to maintain after they are repaired. &quot;Either it is covered by the suspended ceiling or wrapped in the wall, making it impossible to repair some places. If a rod is bent, it is difficult to notice. Some rods are force-bearing rods. If they are suddenly broken, the force will be distributed If the other members cannot bear it, they will suddenly collapse.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang visited many gymnasiums in a city in East China. Out of professional habit, he noticed that the steel structure roofs of some swimming pools were corroded. It&#39;s amazing, the paint is peeling off, but no one pays attention to this problem. Some poorly maintained badminton courts install heavy chandeliers and suspended ceilings on the roof for the convenience of playing, which will make the venue unsafe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an ordinary person, how can we judge whether the steel structure gymnasium we are in is safe? Liu Yonggang introduced the key points of observation: &quot;We mainly look at a few places, first to see how it transmits force. For example, the roof receives the load, and the roof transmits the force to the beams, the beams to the columns, and the columns to the supports and embedded parts. Etc. Therefore, we look at it from the other side, whether the column bolts have fallen off, whether the column has deformed, whether the column elevation has settled, and looking further up, whether the supports between beams have fallen off, whether the beams have deformed, whether the purlins have Is there any bend?” However, when these problems can be seen with the naked eye, it means there is an imminent safety risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the collapse of the Qiqihar Stadium, Heilongjiang requested a comprehensive investigation of public welfare sports venues in the province; after the Jiamusi accident, the local government once again conducted a thorough investigation of long-span spatial structures including gymnasiums, requiring &quot;no discounts, Leave no blind spots and don’t go through the motions.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang believes that regular inspections by government departments are still necessary, but a solid inspection team must be formed. He suggested that the government could invite professionals in architecture and structure to &quot;focus on the inspection targets. First, check the stadiums with longer service life. If rust is found, apply anti-corrosion and anti-rust paint. Secondly, check the stadiums with lower design standards.&quot; Small and medium-sized gymnasiums”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Our construction in the past 20 to 30 years has been a bit too fast. Many times everyone is rushing for work. After the accident, we were also discussing that many steel structures have been repaired for more than 30 years. , especially some venues built in the early stage, should be maintained or demolished.&quot; Liu Yonggang said, &quot;The dividend period of our industry has also passed. In the remaining time, we need to think carefully about the development of this industry and not to kill ourselves. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot; >;(Hui Ze also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:55:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[没点中仇家的死穴，却点到观众的笑穴]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260444]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&quot;Acupoint Storm&quot; is the most recent comedy I have seen The most effective episode. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protagonist of the story, Numakura Koichi (played by Ryuhei Matsuda), was a child when his father owed a huge debt and disappeared, leaving him and his mother to depend on each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gangster leader who keeps collecting debts keeps an eye on my mother and will punch and kick him when he is unhappy.

To put it bluntly, it relies on the occurrence of a series of unexpected events to disintegrate the serious proposition of revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among all film and television genres, comedy is the most deconstructive genre. It liberates us from a certain serious state and also liberates the protagonist from the weight of meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like Koichi Numakura in &quot;The Legend of the Underworld&quot;, he is full of revenge plans, but what he actually does is to save the life of the underworld leader. Before Koichi Numakura even realizes how ridiculous his behavior is, we as the audience have already realized the ridiculousness of him betting his life on revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ad631b60f27814fcb3c4adb8aa08e54.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ad631b60f27814fcb3c4adb8aa08e54.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257964&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comedy is not here To construct meaning and to paint it, we need to dig out the walls of meaning and make it appear somewhat powerless when it collapses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This dissolution of meaning is comprehensive, and the objects it wants to mock include even us as the audience. It just sets a safe distance for us, allowing us to get a kind of psychological comfort from ridiculing the protagonist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After seeing that Numakura Koichi started to practice &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; diligently at the age of ten, and ten years later, he performed acupuncture on the underworld leader under a streetlight, and was beaten until his face was covered with blood. , the pain of being scolded as crazy also coincides with our feelings of working hard but not getting anything in return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d660e6b365ee5cd4d9b0329432df8966.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d660e6b365ee5cd4d9b0329432df8966.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257966&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comedy, use A sudden escape method brings the audience into some common experience or experience, and thus resonates with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Storm in the Cave Realm&quot; obviously understands this well, so most of its plot settings are deduced on this basis. For example, the acquaintance between the heroine Rika Sakamoto (played by Nishino Nanase) and Koichi Numakura is full of a sense of escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sakamoto Rika was originally a young woman who was interested in a massage career. However, due to her father&#39;s high paraplegia in a car accident, she had to work several jobs to support her family. She works in a custom shop at night, and Numakura Koichi met her when he went to the custom shop. She showed her massage skills to Numakura Koichi, but Numakura Koichi had a very bad experience. In turn, he gave Sakamoto Rika a massage, hoping to show her what a real master is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d905a0f491c7c617ebb8567812affaeb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d905a0f491c7c617ebb8567812affaeb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257965&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is, Sakamoto Rika kowtowed and became a disciple on the spot. But at this moment the alarm clock rang. Sakamoto Rika held the alarm clock seriously and asked the newly appointed teacher Numakura Koichi if he wanted to add another clock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/ca53ed503071fc99c7904e30254fca19.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/ca53ed503071fc99c7904e30254fca19.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;257968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Acupoint World&quot; The brilliance of &quot;Wind and Cloud&quot; as a comedy lies in this. It removes the fig leaf and allows you to discover the absurdity behind serious things and the emptiness behind persistence. And all the hard work and dedication sometimes seem like a ridiculous daydream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This ubiquitous comedy makes Numakura Koichi&#39;s determination for revenge turn into a joke in the face of his actual actions to save the underworld leader again and again. The more serious Numakura Koichi looks and the more he swears, the more he looks like a clown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/180acc554311c286ce8487972fb043ed.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/180acc554311c286ce8487972fb043ed.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257967&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a drama It is a collection of ridicule on the great contrast between Numakura Koichi&#39;s spirit and behavior. It is also a sigh about being too persistent and getting into trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is why, when he thought of the underworld leader lying dying in bed due to a car accident, Numakura Koichi suddenly felt that he had lost the motivation to live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He gambled his youth and life, letting hatred and anger fill his mind, but what he got in exchange was that he saved his enemies again and again.

She has published three books, the first is &quot;The Girl Who Often Gets Wandered&quot; written in middle school, the second is &quot;Dong Ke Lou Jing Bian&quot; which was published nearly 20 years ago in 2020, and the third is in 2023 The novella &quot;Legend of Dzi Beads&quot; was published in 2011. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you search for her name, you can also see information about her failure in the college entrance examination more than ten years ago. She won the gold medal in the &quot;Global Chinese Youth Essay Writing Contest&quot; and her article was included in high school Chinese textbooks. But she left Nanjing, where she grew up, with everyone&#39;s speculation that her college entrance examination essay would score 25 points, and went to France to study. She earned a Ph.D. while running her own small antique business (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The &quot;occupation&quot; written on the French visa is &quot;second-hand goods dealer&quot;&lt;/span>;).

She is called a &quot;missing person&quot; by her tutor. Due to various mistakes in administrative procedures, he was forced to become a gangster for nearly four years. During this period, she wandered around Chinatown in the 13th arrondissement of Paris, reading and picking up leaks... Based on the principle of eating more than one fish, or &quot;striving for the maximum reward for labor&quot; - just like her &quot;The Classics of the East Classroom&quot;, won She received a bonus once for the award, a royalties for reprinting it in journals, and it was published once in traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese. She wrote a novel (by the way) based on everything she saw and heard, which is mainly reflected in the third chapter &quot;The Legend of Dzi Beads&quot;. The first &quot;Xing Zehuan&quot; takes place in her hometown of Lixiahe River Basin, and the content is pretty much the same. It&#39;s always about a small antique dealer with little money in his account, showing off his arms. The middle piece is called &quot;Reverse Scene&quot;, which combines drama, supernatural, suspense and science fiction - a very cyberware mashup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7iuJKfhv5ryqGZAEj3FSP0Iuq48pMiJ8v0yN5hoT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;673&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7iuJKfhv5ryqGZAEj3FSP0Iuq48pMiJ8v0yN5hoT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257456&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rich life experience , writing books became a less visible part of it, although it was the part that brought her wider fame. Her novel &quot;Bird&quot; won the United Press Literary Award Short Story Grand Prize, and &quot;Eastern Classroom Classic&quot; won the first prize of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Literary Award. She didn&#39;t even spend much time writing. &quot;Bird&quot; only took one or two hours to write, and the three novellas in &quot;Legend of Dzi Beads&quot; were all completed within half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writer Tang Nuo said: &quot;I have met many excellent novelists and some talented novelists. Fei Ying is one of the best ones I have seen. I shouldn’t have met more than three people... She has relatively few works, which is her trouble. I’m not sure if the novel world can get this person. She may have something she finds more interesting and interesting to do. Do it.&quot; Just like at the Utopia Literary Award Ceremony, no one paid more attention to the sponsor&#39;s products and speeches than she did. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a second-hand dealer, Blancpain&#39;s watch may become her single product. She has done some research on antique watches and knows the two impacts that quartz watches and electronic watches have brought to mechanical watches. While listening to the speech, scattered memories flashed through my mind: French women always like to buy a small lip watch to match their fashions, the soaring price of Italian Vetta, and the fact that Le Jour is a Swiss brand with a French label. She specializes in antiques business, and the knowledge she occasionally learns about clocks and watches is just used for talking with clients, &quot;to look a bit stylish.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the stage, the spokesperson of the sponsor gave his own definition of &quot;defending complexity&quot;: a simple and bright surface, but a very complicated movement; and a watch with 800 parts is difficult to operate. Very simple. Fei Ying suddenly understood the meaning: &quot;Perhaps what mechanical watches and literature do are consistent to some extent, they are both efforts to make time visible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She recalled some auctions or private exchanges Meeting, suspension, exaggeration, strong commercial flavor, but with a special thoughtfulness, which is the product of the mature stage of capitalist development, making people feel a little sincerity of a convention. Like Eliot in Somerset Maugham&#39;s &quot;Blade&quot;, he is keen on hosting parties and even takes care of arranging seats. While being sarcastic, he also sincerely and tolerantly supports everyone&#39;s conversation (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Italics , italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Even vulgar American taste&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This feeling is so complicated that I even think that those of us who are engaged in literature have inherent (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; or intentionally The aloof ignorance and ignorant aloofness displayed&lt;/span>; were also gently lifted up. No, they were protected. After all, in comparison, we are the unprofessional group.&quot; She said in wrote afterwards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fei Yingwen is like a person, with a generous expression, eight teeth exposed when speaking, and eyes narrowed to a slit. She laughed brightly, her clothes were loose and loose, and her sleeves dangled when she walked. When she spoke, she often played with her green peaked cap, on which a duck was raising its head and saying &quot;yeah&quot; with its wings. The antiques, anecdotes, legends, and secrets of the underworld come one after another in her mouth, and they are clearly organized. If she didn&#39;t do this business, she could probably still be a storyteller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said that she is a &quot;social cow whose business personality has been transformed.&quot; She was laughing and joking as if nothing in the world could trouble her - except taking pictures. Fei Ying&#39;s expression in front of the camera lost its joyful expression, her condensed expression scattered all over the floor, and her lively face suddenly became stiff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The publisher said that &quot;Legend of Dzi Beads&quot;, especially the chapter &quot;Chinatown&quot;, seems to be &quot;world literature written by Chinese people&quot;, and it is up to the readers to judge whether it is accurate or not. Anyway, Fei Ying is dancing with joy She was very &quot;worldly&quot; at that time - she was cynical, but she took the injustices she saw seriously - by analogy with the book reviews she wrote, such a straightforward definition may be a bit offensive, and it also seems not very advanced. If you have read her Douban, you can somewhat feel the literary concept hidden in her dense complaints broadcast: presentation, statement, and ending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the way, until now, she has not graduated with a Ph.D. From this, we can expect that this actively or passively extended academic career will lead to more possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sjPrjtBofroQcW5jkI4XrPNVwchuHiunjfInemM6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sjPrjtBofroQcW5jkI4XrPNVwchuHiunjfInemM6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257449&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fei Ying participated in the domestic antiques &quot;Bed Rendezvous&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Old school&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In September 2013, Fei Ying went on a trip with her mother. At the end of the trip, her mother gave her the remaining 2,000 euros in cash and said earnestly: &quot;You are getting older and want to be independent. There is not much money left in your account. You can take the 2,000 euros.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Back in Paris, the 2,000 euros were quickly replaced by one month’s rent (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;700 euros&lt;/span>;) and a year’s subway ride. Ticket (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;700 euros&lt;/span>;), tuition fee for one semester (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; ;&quot;>;400 euros&lt;/span>;) was dismembered, leaving just over a hundred euros. She was struggling to make a living, and she happened to see Faye Wong and Guo Degang wearing Tang Baleng in news photos. At that time, one piece sold for 10,000 yuan on the market. She knew the origin of this bead: it was a kind of agate bead produced between the Han Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty. It was basically imported from Central Asia and was available all over the world. It was large in quantity, similar in appearance, and had limited specificity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She thought of Wang Zengqi&#39;s &quot;Running Alarm&quot;: If someone brings gold, someone will throw away the gold. If someone throws gold, someone will pick up the gold. I am a human, so I can pick up the gold. &quot;I&#39;m a human being, why can&#39;t I pick it up?&quot; She downloaded relevant information on jstor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Academic website&lt;/span>;), borrowed books, and researched The circulation of ancient beads. &quot;I collected all the research materials in this area as if I were writing a doctoral thesis outline.&quot; Fei Ying said, &quot;With some of the original knowledge, it is easier to identify roughly the age and scope, and the purpose of the research. See where it is most likely to be found in the market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A month later, she began to collect scattered Tang Baleng in a larger area. She went to French antique markets and some trade fairs, and flipped through a thousand pages on eBay (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;online auction and shopping website&lt;/span>;), and finally I found a 16-piece Tang Baleng bracelet for $100. It was during Thanksgiving, and the seller had no idea, &quot;It&#39;s only $100. I&#39;m not an artist. I can&#39;t use your iPhone to take clear photos for you.&quot; She had to beg the seller to take a picture of a bead under the light. After taking a close-up photo to confirm the authenticity, I spent US$100 on shipping to get this string of beads across the ocean, and then resold them to a domestic merchant for 5,000 yuan a piece, and I got 80,000. Since then, he has entered the industry and officially became an antique dealer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She concluded that her small antique business mostly provides a service to help customers find what they want. For most collectors, antiques are a kind of consumer product that shows their taste in life. They basically follow the trend in type selection and look for whatever is popular on the market. In recent years, in addition to jade of various ages, she has also helped people find white tea that is more than 30 years old and Moutai liquor that has aged well. &quot;Is Maotai considered an antique?&quot; &quot;Even Cordyceps Sinensis counts.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;These are all unexpected needs. There are still many things to do, including helping them arrange dishes and banquets. For example Talk about interesting games, what kind of things I will show in this game, I will help you arrange it.&quot; Fei Ying said, &quot;Generally, some enjoyable, exquisite, artistic, and luxurious things can be planned in advance.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(Antique dealer) is a very nostalgic profession. Of course there are many pitfalls and deceptions, but there are also moral principles and rules. Speech at the checkout is essential. Exchange knowledge with them and guide their taste. Sometimes, there is the exaggeration and persuasion part. A customer trusts you, and he puts all his investments in this area to you, asking you to help him find the items he likes. You have to keep it true and can return the goods. But you are them Are you a friend? You are just a businessman. They will also invite you to attend some occasions as a cultural bargaining chip. You charge a fee, but you are their old friend. It is very interesting. This is a kind of tradition that has existed since ancient times. , old-school social relationships.&quot; Fei Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old-school communication requires not only the professional ability to distinguish between true and false, but also human sophistication. Most of the top antique dealers Fei Ying came into contact with abroad graduated from prestigious schools, received systematic training, mastered multiple languages, often dealt with the upper class, had excellent eyesight, and treated people professionally and appropriately. &quot;Overseas, collection is a symbol of cultural taste for the middle class and above, and it has too much cultural value.&quot; The domestic antique industry is not yet mature, and it is unlikely to form hierarchies. Fake goods account for 99% of the market, and those selling old goods Most of the antique dealers have a background in land shoveling, &quot;They all love reading.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The class of domestic antique buyers is uncertain and their origins are unknown, which poses a great challenge to the social skills of antique dealers. One of Fei Ying&#39;s friends facilitated a million-dollar business. When delivering the goods, the other party pointed to the collection at home and asked if these items were good. The friend said honestly: &quot;Some of them are fake.&quot; The other party&#39;s face turned dark immediately, and he didn&#39;t mention the transaction from beginning to end. He drank the tea politely and then sent him away politely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Antique exchange meetings are held almost every day, and antique dealers with good physical strength can attend the exhibition 360 days a year. You can definitely save money on food, clothing, housing and transportation. Instead of taking airplanes or high-speed trains, you can use long-distance buses, green trains and other old-fashioned means of transportation. The journey is slow. You won’t necessarily stay in a hotel when you arrive. “Isn’t the 75 yuan a night bathing center delicious? There’s breakfast when you get up.” Fei Ying was running an exhibition in Germany. A few people rented a small van and went with the big truck the next morning. Drinking coffee in a container. But it was also this group of people who bought expensive emeralds at the trade fair in a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the trade fair, they start &quot;fighting&quot; after they like each other. They don&#39;t reveal the bottom price and call each other&#39;s prices, &quot;mutually creating GDP.&quot; The highest transaction volume Fei Ying has ever seen was 1.5 million. After nightfall, only the companions were left. A few of them ordered a late-night snack, bought a few bottles of wine, and began to express their feelings. Even though he was drunk, he still didn’t forget about business: “Let’s talk about that thing during the day.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The world of antiques is full of deceitful economic behaviors, but it is also in this circle that very innocent and straightforward things will come out. .&quot; For example, there is an antique dealer who thinks that you are my friend. Today you brought other friends to my stall, so I will give you a hundred yuan for them all. &quot;I must give you face when you come.&quot; Again. For example, I know you, we met in this place, and you said that you are not doing well recently, then I must &quot;open&quot; for you (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Buy you a thing&lt;/span>;). &quot;This is moral justice. If you are polite, I am more polite than you. If you are particular, I am more particular than you.&quot; Fei Ying said, &quot;There is a comfort in this relationship. Now it is no longer an altruistic society, but this industry can still Give profits to others, leave room for others, and every chain can turn.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /08/Xp8FoKbddQAKQztmWaWEkVjZ8s9jQ3ae645vlDHi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Xp8FoKbddQAKQztmWaWEkVjZ8s9jQ3ae645v lDHi.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;257452&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fei Ying sets up a stall at the 200th Antique Market in Hangzhou&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Background color&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Fei Ying’s antique enlightenment came from a Henan man who met on the street selling fake goods when he was 10 years old. People (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I don&#39;t mean to say anything bad about Henan people.&quot; she added&lt;/span>;). She visited street stalls in Nanjing and was attracted by their fake goods. They offered her snacks and told her they were fake. She was invited to their small workshop and learned a lot of counterfeiting techniques. &quot;Because the technology of counterfeiting is real, all the knowledge surrounding counterfeiting is the knowledge you need to identify the authenticity.&quot; They even taught Fei Ying how to behave, quoting many stories of receiving goods, such as the goods worth 5,000 yuan, the owner of which was in prison because of drug addiction. Yes, I&#39;m willing to sell it for 2,800 yuan. This is a warning: Don&#39;t get involved in pornography, gambling, and drugs. Once you get involved, you will be dead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why she likes antiques also comes from this experience. &quot;Antiques are the accumulation of a person&#39;s spirit and a very concentrated expression of the aesthetics of an era. For example, everyone says that the aesthetics of the Song Dynasty represents a peak of Chinese aesthetics. If you look at a porcelain bottle, it has the lines of blue and white porcelain. , can we say that this is the highest peak of Chinese aesthetics? This itself is something that makes me think it has more meaning. Antiques can be 100% authentic, but the judgment is moving and there are evolutions in various senses. The whole thing is more attractive to me . It is not like a text. The text does not know whether it is true or false at all. The meaning is completely fluid. Even the meaning of a word is very unstable. It is too easy to be used by many people and then determined to have another meaning. But The object is already a thing of the past. It has its truth and falsehood, and it is a kind of correctness. But on top of that, it has many additional meanings, and this meaning is changing. There are many conflicts and conflicts in between. Pull. I really feel something very futile or meaningless. These aesthetic changes have affected my life and turned me into a cynical person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cynicism is Fei Ying Her background makes all the anxieties presented in the novel and born out of life seem to be incapable of hurting her. The portrait that fits her is probably always wandering the streets of all sizes with her arms swaying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/mehZunkXety5GUzBzrgzkmuuVrCMKFKDHyp7sNK7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/mehZunkXety5GUzBzrgzkmuuVrCMKFKDHyp7sNK7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257448&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fei Ying started learning at Yongle Auction&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In November 2016, Fei Ying went to renew her residence permit for the next year as required. French administrative processing is very slow, there are too many applications backlogged, the system often crashes, and online appointments cannot be made. She can only queue up at the immigration office in her living area to grab the 50 numbers every day. After two or three failures, she waited in line at 4 a.m. on a snowy night until dawn, and finally sat in front of the immigration staff. The staff arranged for her to submit the materials six months later. One month after submitting the materials, the other party sent a letter telling her that she applied too late and the information was stuck in the police station&#39;s system. It was suggested that she return to the country and apply for a study visa again. She queued up again to appeal, but was rejected. At the same time, because she had made an appeal, her materials were locked by the system and could no longer be accepted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She just became a gangster. She found a lawyer who specializes in litigating cases for Algerians, who told her that she could go through the process of regularizing her status after two more years of blackmail, which would give her 10 years in law. The lawyer charged 1,800 euros. Fei Ying was shocked by the fee. The other party said: &quot;Because I&#39;m not sure whether I can help you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lawyer had two suggestions: &quot;First, take the current paper I tore my passport and applied for a new one. Anyway, the police station and immigration are not connected to the Internet. Secondly, change to another police station. This police station is well-known in the industry for its bad attitude. Let’s change the area.&quot; So she moved to Paris 13 94 Province, a subway station away from Chinatown in the district, started a gamble without a residence document for more than two years. Then there is the story of &quot;Legend of Dzi Beads&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many things that you cannot do as a gangster, such as working legally. Many people would be anxious for Fei Ying when they saw her doing nothing, but she was really not in a hurry. &quot;Perhaps a personality formed since childhood, I think it is all bad, or it will be like this anyway. Why are you anxious? Life is just like this. Look at your age at the age of three, you don&#39;t know how you became such a person Yes, but I have never been anxious about any problems of my own. If I am anxious, it may only be about social fairness and justice.&quot; She said, &quot;Just like I have a serious and honest attitude towards antiques. , what should this item look like, what era is it from, whether it is real or fake... I will be very serious. I also have the same attitude towards many things in this world, what should this thing be like? In this way, whether everyone gets what he deserves, or even how a book should be evaluated, I may even make a misjudgment at the time, but at that time I was very serious, and it is what it should be. So. But I don’t care enough about a certain material thing that I like, because I think the things I like are fluid after all.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world seems to be getting worse and worse, indeed. It&#39;s hard to make people feel relaxed, and perhaps this is one of the reasons why Fei Ying has made so many comments on Douban. &quot;Because you can&#39;t handle everything. If you want to express some opinions, you have to bear the consequences. I hope you will be able to bear the consequences in the future, but you may not be able to now. Sometimes your attitude and voice will be misinterpreted. I have seen too many things, and the consequences of too many actions, all happened like this, even if the starting point is good. Even in history, there are too many individual voices that will speak out for some social phenomena, but after speaking out, the entire incident In fact, the direction of the epidemic and the great consequences it will cause cannot be borne by one person. Just like you build a nuclear bomb. Every individual must be responsible for his own words and deeds, just like when I make antiques, I am responsible for what I sell. Every thing is responsible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[最早发明指南针的确是中国，但不是司南]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260460]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As for the compass, one of the four great inventions, like the other three great inventions, there are also many debates in the public. Among the more important ones are &quot;Sinan is a fake, so the compass is also a fake&quot; and &quot;Europe invented the compass one step earlier than China in 1190&quot;. These claims are specious. There is indeed a need to re-examine the invention, spread and significance of the compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;True and fake compasses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;First of all, the &quot;Sinan&quot; we saw in the history books &quot;puts a magnetic spoon on the plate, and no matter how you turn the handle of the spoon, it always points to the south&quot;, It is constructed, and there is no such thing from documents to physical objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The literature basis for the view that &quot;Si Nan&quot; is a compass mainly comes from &quot;Han Feizi&quot; of the Warring States Period and &quot;Lunheng&quot; by Wang Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty. However, this is a misunderstanding or distortion of the documentary records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Han Feizi·Youdu Pian&quot; states: &quot;The invasion of the master by ladies and ministers is like the terrain, and they gradually pass by, causing the master to make mistakes and change faces from east to west without knowing it. Therefore, the king established &quot;Si Nan means day and night.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Si Nan&quot; here is not a compass, but marks the north-south direction on the court. It means that the king sits north and faces south, and uses magical instruments and rituals to consolidate the dignity of the emperor and the inferiority of his ministers. political landscape. It is very easy to find out where the south is when it is stationary. Just identify it according to the direction of the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. It does not require high technology or instruments such as a compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Lunheng·Shiyingpian&quot; states: &quot;The ancients were simple, and when they saw the movement of grass, they could refer to it, and if they could refer to it, they could refer to the sycophants. When Sinan&#39;s ladle was thrown to the ground, it was &quot;Guide.&quot; Fish and flesh insects gather in the ground and travel north, so the nature of insects is the same. Today&#39;s grass can refer to it, and it is also nature.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chong&#39;s purpose in writing this article is to oppose the influence of heaven and man in the Confucian classics of the Han Dynasty This concept believes that the characteristics of natural things are their own nature and has nothing to do with human affairs. The two examples cited are &quot;Sinan&#39;s Ladle&quot; and &quot;Fish and Flesh Worms&quot;. &quot;Lao&quot; refers to the Big Dipper, not a spoon. The meaning of the sentence &quot;Sinan&#39;s ladle, thrown to the ground, is a guide&quot; means that the Big Dipper (like a spoon shape) with guiding properties is projected to the ground, and the handle of the spoon is The direction it points to is south, but this is just a characteristic of the Big Dipper itself and has nothing to do with personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that whether it is &quot;Han Feizi&quot; or &quot;Lunheng&quot;, the &quot;Si Nan&quot; mentioned has nothing to do with the compass. So, why can the &quot;Sinan&quot; with a spoon on the plate, which was constructed due to misinterpretation of the literature, really be a guide? Because this thing is artificially magnetized using modern technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1947, Wang Zhenduo made the so-called &quot;Sinan&quot; with a spoon on the plate based on the record of &quot;Sinan&#39;s ladle, throw it on the ground, and guide it&quot;. He claimed that no matter how the magnet rotates on the plate, it will It will eventually point to the south, so I successfully copied &quot;Sinan&quot;. The truth is that because the spoon is too big, the friction when rotating on the plate is too great. The magnetism of the natural magnet cannot restrain the friction. Wang Zhenduo put the natural magnet into the magnetic field to magnetize it to achieve the effect of always guiding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancients did not have magnetization technology, so it was impossible to make &quot;Si Nan&quot; that did not exist in the literature. It is untenable to regard &quot;Si Nan&quot; as a compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people also believe that based on the records of magnets in the ancient Chinese books &quot;Lu Shi Chun Qiu&quot; and &quot;Huainan Zi&quot;, China has recognized the magnetism of magnets in ancient times and was able to create compasses at that time. This statement is also specious. Recognizing that magnets have magnetism to attract iron does not mean that they also recognize that magnets naturally have the characteristic of pointing to the South Pole. The polarity of magnets was not recorded until the Song Dynasty, so it is impossible to have invented it in the Warring States, Qin and Han Dynasties. Compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Heng of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Ma Jun of the Cao Wei Dynasty, and Zu Chongzhi of the Southern Dynasty invented the compass car. However, the compass car did not use magnetism to indicate the direction, but used gear friction to keep the wooden figure on the car pointing in one direction. Although this invention has its value, factors such as wheel size errors and uneven road surfaces will cause deviations in the direction of the wooden man. Secondly, it cannot be used for navigation, so it is of little use. Therefore, it will be lost and reinvented many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The controversy between water compass and dry compass&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, although Sinan was constructed and the compass is not that amazing, the compass was indeed invented by the Chinese first. The evidence is strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, Yang Weide, an official of Sitiantai, mentioned in the &quot;Fuyuan Zonglu&quot; that the &quot;Bingwu needle&quot; pointed at a constant point was used to survey Feng Shui, and the &quot;Wu Jing Zong Yao&quot; mentioned that giving iron pieces a certain Magnetism made a &quot;guide fish&quot;, which floated in the water bowl and used the guide method. This was about the 1040s AD. In the Song Shenzong era that followed, the compass had achieved greater development. Shen Kuo&#39;s &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot; mentioned four forms of compasses, including the water float method, the bowl-lip spiral method, the nail spiral method, and the thread-suspended method. And think that the wisp method is the best. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest record of the use of a compass in navigation can be found in Zhu Yu&#39;s &quot;Pingzhou Ke Tan&quot; in the late Northern Song Dynasty. It is said that &quot;the boat master knows the geography, observes the stars at night, observes the sun during the day, and observes the sun when it is dark.&quot; Observe the Compass” (1120s AD). The &quot;earth snail&quot; mentioned in Zeng Sanyi&#39;s &quot;Yin Hua Lu&quot; in the early Southern Song Dynasty (1170s) was a compass designed by Feng Shui masters to improve the equipment for observing Feng Shui. The compass still used a floating needle guide with water, but Subdividing the azimuth scale allows people to grasp the direction more accurately. This is also the earliest recorded compass in the world, but there is no evidence that the compass was used for navigation at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is some controversy as to whether the dry compass was invented in China or Europe. Because according to existing documents, Europe may have mastered the dry compass before the Arabs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1190, the British theologian Alexander Nicham mentioned in &quot;On the Nature of Nature&quot; that &quot;a needle placed on a fulcrum will point out the direction of navigation after the rotation stops&quot;, which is very descriptive. It&#39;s like a dry compass, and the earliest Arab document recording a compass is Muhammad Ofi&#39;s &quot;Collection of Stories&quot; in 1232, after the Europeans, and it records a water compass rather than a dry compass.有一些国外学者据此主张，中国人是发明了水罗盘且影响了伊斯兰世界，但是欧洲人独立发明了旱罗盘，并最先将其用于航海。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，中国最早明确记载旱罗盘的典籍是1170年代的《因话录》，1985年又在江西临川的宋邵武知军朱济南墓（葬于1198年）中发现了手持旱罗盘的“张仙人”陶俑，则旱罗盘应该是先诞生于中国。但是其年代与欧洲记录旱罗盘的1190年过于接近，仅凭这些难以判定旱罗盘是中国传播到欧洲的，中欧各自独立发明旱罗盘仍然很有可能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实中国在这之前就有一些模糊的疑似旱罗盘的记载，托名东晋郭璞的《九天玄女青囊海角经》当是唐代典籍，记载了用于指南的天盘、地盘，北宋前期王伋的风水学著作《罗经诱解》也用“虚危之间针路明，南方张度上三乘；坎离正位人难识，差却毫厘断不灵”这样一首诗记录类似罗盘的装置。很有可能中国发明旱罗盘远比南宋早，因此有时间西传到欧洲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过在中国，旱罗盘一直用于堪舆风水之术，在欧洲则很快用于航海，到16世纪嘉靖年间，中国人受到东来的欧洲人启发，才将用来看风水几百年的旱罗盘用于航海。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在笃信宗教的古人那里，新发明往往最先是宗教用品，然后才投入实用，旱罗盘功能的演变也符合这条规律。但欧洲率先将习得不久的旱罗盘投入实用，技术转换成生产力的速度比中国更快，则又说明中世纪盛期的欧洲，其社会活力比中国历朝最具活力的宋朝更胜一筹。这时纠结谁先发明旱罗盘，已经不重要了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;指南针是重要的航海技术之一&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;宋代是中国罕见的允许本国商船出海经营的时代，所以指南针和水罗盘发明后，几十年之内，12世纪后期就传给了伊斯兰世界，13世纪穆罕默德•奥菲的波斯轶闻集《故事大全》中记录了使用类似中国指南鱼的铁片寻路的故事，足以证明技术是从中国传来的。欧洲人最先把旱罗盘投入航海，但懂得利用磁针的指南特性，很可能也是受中国影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;指南针对于世界航海技术确实有很大的助力，对地中海地区尤其如此。地中海阴天很多，传统的根据太阳、月亮和星辰来给自己定位的导航技术，在阴雨天作用会大打折扣甚至完全失效，这时指南针的作用就弥足珍贵了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，从长远来看，指南针也只是诸多重要航海技术中的一种而已，不宜过于神化，“没有指南针就没有大航海时代”的说法更是与事实不符。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在新石器时代，大洋洲的原始人通过对洋流、天体、动物、云气的观测，已经具备非常杰出的导航技术，所以他们仅仅使用简陋的独木舟，最多装上舷外托架来装载补给、运送人员，却能从东南亚一路向东殖民太平洋岛屿，直到离南美洲不太远的复活节岛，往西他们则横穿印度洋到达了非洲的马达加斯加岛。如此波澜壮阔的上古“大航海时代”，并不需要指南针就能够实现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1世纪时，希腊人希帕鲁斯发现了印度洋季风的规律，从此罗马帝国的船只可以借力季风直达印度，不用再沿着海岸绕路，极大地缩短了航程，显著加强了亚欧大陆的联系，其中的技术含量只在指南针之上，不在其之下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8世纪以来，维京人利用简陋的分节的木棍，乃至竖起一根手臂、一只手指，观察其与特应天体的偏角，来确定自己的位置，从斯堪的纳维亚半岛一路航行到冰岛、格陵兰岛乃至美洲，也并没有指南针的身影。据此可知，就是没有指南针，哥伦布同样可以发现新大陆，只是更难一些而已。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，在指南针之前和之后，其他文明也拥有诸多重要的航海技术，这些技术对航海的促进并不在指南针之下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如古希腊的星盘，海员可以在星盘上排列出特定时日天空中天体的相对位置，如果水手能够确定日期与时间，就能够调整代表不同纬度的铜环，调到排列出的天体跟当下看到的天体投影位置一致时，就能确定自己的纬度。这对海员的位置指示作用还在指南针之上，只是观测天体需要晴天，会受到气候的限制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;又如17世纪发明的四分仪、18世纪发明的六分仪，可以通过测量天体的高度来确定自己的纬度，操作比星盘更简便。白天，测量太阳与地平线的角度，夜晚，在北半球测量北极星与地平线的夹角，南半球则测量南十字座与地平线的夹角，只要移动指标臂，让太阳、北极星或南十字座与地平线对齐，就能在指标臂上得到自己所在的纬度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确定海员所在的经度比纬度要难得多，但到1736年，英国木匠约翰•哈里森发明了海钟，解决了这一世纪性难题。只要将海钟设定为英国格林尼治标准时间，海员无论航行到哪里，只要在太阳最高的正午时分看海钟上的时间，就能推断自己离格林尼治有多远，从而确定自己的经度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以上重要发明，哪一样对航海的作用都不在指南针之下，世界航海技术进步是各文明合力的结果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;指南针在中国停滞，在欧洲进步&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;不论欧洲用旱罗盘航海是否受到中国指南针的影响，指南针都当之无愧地是中国的发明。但是很可惜，中国发明了指南针，就到此为止了，而欧洲则对旱罗盘不断改进，且通过对罗盘的研究，启发了制图学和磁学的发展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;13世纪的法国学者佩雷格里努斯，基于对指南针的研究，想要运用磁力来作为武器的动力装置，在给朋友的信中谈到对磁性较全面的认知，开磁学研究之先河。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;14世纪初，意大利人阿马尔费塔尼发明了盘随针转的旱罗盘“罗盘卡”，令磁针的指向更加清晰。同时，意大利人也利用罗盘的方位线来绘制航海图，让航海图比欧洲中世纪的TO寰宇图大为精确。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;进入铁船时代后，欧美海员意识到铁船本身的磁力会对指南针产生干扰，他们在指南针上装一片弗林德斯顿铁，来抵消铁船磁场导致的指南针的误差，这成为19世纪铁船的通例。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1906年，德国人H•安休兹发明了陀螺罗盘，快速旋转的陀螺仪会利用地球的自转寻找到地区的真北方向，而且不会受到地磁场和附近金属的影响，非常适合在金属载具的内部使用。陀螺轮盘很快就被欧美海军采用，后来更广泛地使用于航天领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1932年，无线电罗盘在空军投入实用。无线电罗盘通过计算飞机与释放出的电波的夹角，来判定飞机前行的方向，为飞行员提供清晰的指向，在罗盘技术上又前进了一大步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;技术只有不断使用才能发展。明清时代大体上实行闭关锁国，片板不许下海，虽然民间走私业颇为繁荣，但在朝廷的打击下，东亚的航海业仍然受到重大影响，科技停滞自然在情理之中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国自周秦以来就有“天朝上国”的思想，视邻国如蛮夷，没有多少交往的热情。宋元时代是少有的例外，所以发明了指南针，但到了明清，伴随着禁海政策，与海外交流变少之后，自高自大的心态变本加厉，也阻止了民间自发地改进指南针。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就算是相对宽松、社会较有活力的宋元时代，在秦制的管束下也仍然有其上限，以当时的货运量可能并没有迫切改进指南针的需要，所以宋代虽然难得地发明了指南针，但进一步的改进也不多。所以，只有制度宽松、观念开放、社会活跃的社会，科学技术才能蓬勃发展，这是指南针的历史给我们的启示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被检出兽药残存，明治召回4.4万瓶牛奶！客服回应了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260470]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 16:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Remnants of veterinary drugs were detected in Meiji milk, a well-known Japanese dairy brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 11, according to the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), the famous Japanese dairy brand Meiji Milk announced the recall of 44,000 bottles of bottled milk that have been on the market due to the detection of veterinary drug residues in the products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/9c973624a99c1a9fc552d3637d344bcc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;602&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/9c973624a99c1a9fc552d3637d344bcc.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258011&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that this veterinary drug residue is called sulfamethoxazole, which is commonly used to prevent or treat infectious diseases in cattle or pigs. Since this substance will remain in the milk and have adverse effects on the human body, in accordance with production safety regulations, this drug must not be used on animals within 72 hours before milking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), the milk with residual residue was produced by Meiji Dairy&#39;s Kansai factory in Kaizuka City, Osaka Prefecture, and is mainly 180 ml bottles for home delivery. On the 6th, the local government discovered veterinary drug residues during an inspection of the factory and ordered Meiji to recall the problematic products in accordance with relevant food safety regulations. So far, about 44,000 bottles of the product have been recalled. However, since the shelf life of this batch of problematic products ends on November 13, the products have been sold in many regions such as western and central Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, Meiji Dairy Group issued a product recall announcement and stated that it would conduct a thorough investigation of the raw milk and production process to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The company argued in the announcement that there is currently no evidence to prove that residual sulfamethoxazole is obviously harmful to the human body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding this matter, a reporter from Nandu Wancaishe asked the customer service of the Meiji flagship store on major e-commerce platforms. The Meiji customer service on the JD.com platform stated that the milk and other products sold by the store in China, except for the use of Except for the raw milk raw materials produced in China, all dairy products are made from dairy products other than Japan. Moreover, the acceptance of raw milk is strictly in accordance with the regulations of the Chinese government, so please feel free to eat it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/66b60fd49e7eb2d4cee80761f61c7d0d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;681&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/66b60fd49e7eb2d4cee80761f61c7d0d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258010&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Meiji customer service on the Taobao platform stated that the chocolates and biscuits sold in the store are produced in China, and there are no milk products sold in the store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/94007c36a82c2c134b41e0abe37bd10d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/94007c36a82c2c134b41e0abe37bd10d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258009&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 16:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子在昆明海埂大坝“捡垃圾”谋生？真相与事实不符]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260456]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A woman posted a video&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Screen It was she who picked up plastic bottles at Haigeng Dam in Kunming&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reverse happened the next second&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/f9ed9baba59b0d5c749ab9c6c7a6a464.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;661&quot; height=&quot;946&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/12/f9ed9baba59b0d5c749ab9c6c7a6a464.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257982&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/12/b6df50b17db342cf66be00451efa2d82.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1073&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 12/b6df50b17db342cf66be00451efa2d82.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257983&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports, when the woman took the video, the witness Mr. Lin happened to be playing at Haigeng Dam and witnessed the woman leading her child to take the video.

It is said that if you have never used or even heard a term starting with &quot;Princess please&quot;, then you are already behind the Internet trend. This new &quot;meme&quot; on the Internet is not only used as a joke between parents, children and spouses, but also used by some businesses for &quot;Double Eleven&quot; promotions and live broadcasts to bring goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prototype of the line &quot;Princess please&quot; comes from the classic old movie &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. The reporter played by Gregory Peck said &quot;Princess please&quot; to the princess played by Audrey Hepburn. &quot;Get in the car&quot;; and &quot;Princess please&quot; became an Internet meme, which originated from a funny video on Douyin: a father picked up his daughter on a bicycle, but the daughter said &quot;You said &#39;Princess please get in the car&#39;&quot;. Unexpectedly, the father did not continue riding away, leaving his daughter behind to chase him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this funny video became popular on the short video platform, it immediately brought about a wave of imitation and secondary creation. The main promoters were short video bloggers and e-commerce platform merchants, which gave rise to &quot; More hot memes like &quot;Princess please drink tea&quot;, &quot;Princess please dine&quot;, &quot;Princess please sign for receipt&quot; and &quot;Princess please place order&quot; can be described as a victory of &quot;emotional marketing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the carnival of &quot;Princess Please&quot; has gradually emerged with some new &quot;games&quot;, and its negative externalities are worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is the &quot;identity&quot; issue of the &quot;Princess Please&quot; short video on the Internet platform. A careful review of these &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos on the short video platform can be roughly divided into three types: one is completely staged and belongs to situational skits; the other is a real shot on the spot, with immediate reactions to the real shot; the third is difficult to distinguish between true and false. It’s not marked and can’t be seen, which is problematic in itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These short videos are common on social media platforms: bloggers find the takeaway guy and ask him to say &quot;Princess, please dine&quot;; ask the boss at the restaurant to cooperate in filming &quot;Princess, please dine&quot;; ask the bus and An online ride-hailing driver said &quot;Princess, please get out of the car&quot;; he asked security guards at the school gate to say &quot;Princess, please go back to school&quot;; recently in Nanjing, Jiangsu, a woman who fell asked an ambulance doctor to say &quot;Princess, please get in the car&quot;; and even in Yunnan Province In a certain hospital, a surgeon appeared in the process of operating on a patient and said &quot;Please princess, please remove the electric knife&quot; and &quot;Please say thank you princess&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is obvious at a glance that most of these &quot;Princess Please&quot; short videos are fictitious and staged, but the result is that they appear to be &quot;real-looking&quot;. Such an unlabeled operation is inevitable Non-compliant. Disguising it as news to mislead the public is not without the suspicion of guiding public opinion. I would like to ask, will the proliferation of &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos create the illusion that &quot;all walks of life say &quot;Princess Please&quot; is a reality, and in turn &quot;force&quot; all walks of life to &quot;must say Princess please&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Notice on Strengthening the Management of &quot;We-Media&quot;&quot;, which is commonly known as the &quot;Thirteen Articles&quot;, including &quot;annotation of fictitious content or controversial information&quot; Requirements for &quot;label&quot; (Article 5): When &quot;self-media&quot; publishes content that contains fictional plots and plot interpretations, the website platform should require it to mark the fiction or interpretation label in a conspicuous manner. If the staged &quot;Princess Please&quot; is not marked and deliberately makes it difficult to distinguish the authenticity, it will inevitably be suspected of violating this law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, whether staged or real, the proliferation of &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos has brought about problems of blurred boundaries and emotional blackmail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When parents, children and spouses say &quot;Princess please&quot;, it is an emotional interaction between close relatives; when e-commerce platform customer service personnel say &quot;Princess please&quot;, it is to use emotional marketing to promote actual transactions. Follow It is also the market principle of voluntary transactions; and if strangers who are neither relatives nor friends must be forced to say &quot;Princess please&quot; in front of the camera, and even public authorities follow the &quot;playful joke&quot;, this will cause a problem. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to those &quot;princess please&quot; short videos that are obviously staged, there is also a type of &quot;princess please&quot; that is real and even more worrying: the head teacher takes advantage of his position to ask a whole room of primary school students to shout &quot; Princess, please leave the get out of class.&quot; &quot;Beautiful princess, please leave the class.&quot; Children don&#39;t quite understand what posing is, so teaching them to cooperate in a performance only requires &quot;coercion and inducement.&quot; This approach is tantamount to using one&#39;s position to coerce children to satisfy their own emotional values ​​and help them harvest traffic. It is not compliant with the procedures and unfair in the results. It is not the way to teach and educate people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Official accounts of government departments also use &quot;Princess Please&quot; to promote laws and regulations. It seems to be a closer relationship and facilitates dissemination, but it can easily give people the impression of not being serious in the long run. It is also detrimental to popularize legal knowledge and promote citizens to abide by the law: what public authorities need is to perform their statutory duties, strictly abide by the law and strictly enforce the law. How can they show such a humble attitude of &quot;asking people to abide by the law&quot; and &quot;asking people to abide by the law&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the popular &quot;Princess Please&quot; is just another &quot;Internet meme&quot; destined to have a short life cycle, but it has characteristics that are different from previous &quot;Internet memes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Princess Please&quot; is not the first-generation Internet meme of &quot;emotional marketing&quot;. Memes such as &quot;kiss&quot; and &quot;little fairy&quot; have been circulated for several times. Online language ebbs and flows, coming and going quickly. This is what is commonly known as &quot;language inflation&quot; (referred to as &quot;call inflation&quot;): just like currency, the &quot;face value&quot; of language is getting larger and larger, and the value it expresses is getting bigger and bigger. However, its &quot;value&quot; is getting smaller and smaller, and the thoughts and feelings it can carry are becoming increasingly poor. All kinds of &quot;internet memes&quot; are overused but internally poor, and have become quickly decaying words instead of meaningful idioms, which is the natural ending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter how you play &quot;Princess Please&quot;, it should still follow the principle of voluntariness, there must be boundaries, public power should not be involved, and teachers should not emotionally blackmail students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[涉嫌贩卖出生医学证明，广西南宁相关医院责任人已被采取刑事强制措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260468]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 15:14:51&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The reporter learned from the Nanning Municipal Health Commission in Guangxi that people reported that a hospital in Nanning was suspected of selling medical birth certificates , the obstetrics and gynecology department of the hospital involved has been suspended for rectification, and criminal coercive measures have been taken against the relevant responsible persons of the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a joint investigation by the health, public security and other departments, it was found that the hospital involved was Nanning Chenghe Hospital, and relevant work such as investigation and evidence collection is being further carried out.
