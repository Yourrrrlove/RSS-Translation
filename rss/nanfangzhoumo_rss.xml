In the parent group Various analyzes and discussions. Because Beijing recently issued a new high school entrance examination plan, which will be applicable to students in eighth grade (second grade) this year. The main change is to move the primary four subjects of history, geography, chemistry, and biology out of the examination subjects. They will no longer be counted in the total score of the high school entrance examination. They will be changed into examination subjects, divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. &quot;The results will be used for graduation.&quot; , for reference in further studies.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, the entrance exams (selective exams) and graduation exams (passing exams) for middle and high schools were separated. The former is the well-known high school entrance examination and college entrance examination. The scores of each subject are counted into the total score. High schools or universities are admitted from high to low according to the total score. The latter is called the Huikao, with passing scores (100 points for the paper-based test and 60 points for the paper-based test). Pass), if you pass the national examination in all subjects, you will obtain a junior high school or high school diploma. The HKCEE in the past was equivalent to the &quot;Academic Proficiency Examination&quot; today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now Beijing&#39;s Primary 4 Course of History, Geography, Biochemistry has been changed to grade-based grades. In essence, this Primary 4 subject has been changed from a selective subject in the high school entrance examination to a subject of a general examination nature. That&#39;s why &quot;the results are used for graduation&quot; &quot; said. As for &quot;use for reference in further studies&quot;, is it left to the high school to decide whether to use it or not, or is it to be used when two candidates have the same total score in the high school entrance examination, and there is no clear statement yet about who has a higher level than the primary four subjects. . The subjects that are still included in the total score of the high school entrance examination include: Morality and Rule of Law, Chinese, Mathematics, Foreign Languages, Physics, Physical Education and Health, a total of 6 subjects, of which Morality and Rule of Law will be changed to open-book examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some parents think this change is good: there are fewer subjects that require high school entrance examinations, and the academic burden on their children is also reduced. This view needs to be looked at in two ways: If parents are not obsessed with their children entering a good high school, that is naturally correct; if parents still want their children to go to a prestigious school, then in the context of a 50-50 split, merit selection It is still inevitable that students will compete for the total score of the remaining six subjects. In order to increase the degree of differentiation, the difficulty of the questions in these six high school entrance examination subjects may be increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other parents disagree and believe that when there are many subjects, if the child cannot learn well in one or two subjects, it can be remedied and he can learn other subjects well. However, now the number of subjects in the high school entrance examination has been reduced. With four doors, there is no room for such remediation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latter believes that kicking the primary school students out of the high school entrance examination will be detrimental to Puwa, who has average qualifications. A netizen said that his distant cousin just took the high school entrance examination in Beijing this year and scored more than 80 points in the math test. She relied on the primary four subjects to get close to the perfect score to bring her total score up, and she was admitted to a city key point. But now this document has Come on, after 2025, children like her will basically have no chance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This view actually makes sense. For subjects like mathematics and physics, even if students memorize every definition, theorem and even every page in the book, it will not help if they do not understand the meaning and connotation. Ultimately, these subjects examine students’ logical thinking (abstract thinking) and pattern (structure, regularity) recognition abilities, which are the core of general intelligence. If you are not talented in this area, relying on experienced teachers to make up lessons may not necessarily have significant results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, in the primary four subjects of history, geography, biochemistry, history is classified as a liberal arts subject, and geography, biology, and chemistry are regarded as science subjects, but the latter are generally regarded as &quot;liberal subjects among science subjects&quot;, especially in junior high schools. At this stage, this Primary 4 exam mainly tests students&#39; memorization. Students with good memory or sufficient diligence will be able to pass the test perfectly and get high scores. Considering that merit-based examinations such as the high school entrance examination and the college entrance examination rank and select students&#39; intelligence and abilities, let subjects such as physics and mathematics remain within the scope of the high school entrance examination, and put Primary 4 subjects within the scope of the passing/standard examination. , is understandable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing wrote in the basic principles of the new high school entrance examination plan: &quot;Cultivate students&#39; scientific spirit, promote the training and selection of talents in basic subjects, and better utilize the role of examination enrollment in improving the quality of the people and serving the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education. &quot;It is a basic requirement for a &quot;qualified&quot; merit-based selection examination to allow students with outstanding talents and curiosity to explore the truth to stand out instead of being buried in a pile of high scores without distinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are also issues worthy of discussion. For example, starting from 2025, Beijing will continue to include sports in the merit-based high school entrance examination, and the score will be increased from 40 points to 70 points. The Beijing Physical Education High School Entrance Examination in 2022 will be changed to a qualifying examination, and reaching the standard will mean full marks, which is a good attempt. Because athletic talent, like intellectual talent, is mainly innate. Sports schools want to select talents with athletic talents, and it is appropriate to conduct relevant merit-based examinations; if they want to go to high school, it is appropriate to conduct passing/standard examinations like the primary school, otherwise it will affect the &quot;promotion of The goal of &quot;training and selecting talents in basic disciplines&quot; constitutes significant interference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most athletically gifted people and the most intellectually gifted people do not overlap very much. The two kinds of merit-based selection combined will lead to the following: the most athletically gifted and most intelligent people are likely not to go to the best high schools. On the contrary, one type of people will have an advantage: they are not the most outstanding in both talents but The combination is better, the family background is good, the parents are willing to invest, and the individual is willing to work hard. Changing sports to standard examinations can solve this problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many media have reported on &quot;junior high school students in the gym.&quot; Parents apply for gym memberships for them and hire private teachers to give them one-on-one tutoring at a cost of several hundred yuan per hour, so that they can strive for the highest possible scores in the physical education high school entrance examination. This is already contrary to the original intention of sports to strengthen the body, and over-training of developing children in adolescence is counterproductive to physical health. There are many cases of knee wear and sports injuries among junior high school students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing’s high school entrance examination is often regarded as a benchmark. How it is modified may have an impact on the reform of high school entrance examinations in other places. Therefore, it is normal for everyone to be concerned, analyze and discuss a lot. How to take the test will determine how to teach and how to learn. How can the test and teaching truly match the original goals? This is worthy of continuous exploration and reflection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[有人怕狗，有人爱狗，“宠物友好”空间能否消除对立？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259318]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pet Friendly 2&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/25/4877343745.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /10/25/4877343745.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255531&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot; >;March 11, 2023, Shanghai Xuhui Riverside, there are many pet-friendly spaces here, and it is regarded as a dog walking paradise by many &quot;poop scrapers&quot;. Photographed by China News Service reporter Yin Liqin Visual China | Picture&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When people and dogs meet on a narrow road, there are usually two kinds of fear: fear that the dog will be too enthusiastic and scare the person; fear that the person will be too enthusiastic and scare the dog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of being chased and bitten by dogs in her childhood left a shadow on Luo Youyou. Whenever she encountered an unleashed dog, she would pretend to be calm and leave quickly, but her hands were still shaking and she was so nervous that she couldn&#39;t help but feel nervous. Know which foot to put first.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he went out with his eight-month-old golden retriever Lucky, even though he had a leash on it, Feng Yun still didn’t dare to let curious children touch it. “Lucky is usually very well-behaved, but what if he gets into trouble?” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Youyou and Feng Yun, two types of people who are afraid of dogs and those who love dogs, have a small consensus that human pets should share public places with some separation, but they still have conflicts in the limited space. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 16, 2023, a girl in Chongzhou, Sichuan was bitten by a Rottweiler dog in the community. The police have opened a case for investigation and taken criminal coercive measures against the dog owner Tang Mou in accordance with the law. On October 23, according to Xinhua News Agency, the injured girl had been transferred out of the ICU and her vital signs were currently stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a mother, Luo Youyou is very sad to see such news. When her daughter was under one year old, she was also besieged by pet dogs in the community. She was thankful that her daughter was not injured at the time, and since then she has not dared to &quot;walk her baby&quot; alone in the community. After having a daughter, Luo Youyou discovered that the places for walking babies and walking dogs in the city were highly overlapped. When pushing a stroller into the green space around the community, she often encountered dogs that were not on leashes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The habits of dogs determine that they need space to release energy and appropriate contact with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to alleviate the conflict between people and pets, in recent years, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu and other cities have begun to build &quot;pet-friendly&quot; shopping malls, hotels, parks... allowing pets to enter with conditions, and providing carts, elevators, and toilets. and other “pet-only” facilities and services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Opening public spaces is the first step to be pet-friendly, but more importantly, respect and understand the needs of pets: pet owners should walk their dogs in a civilized manner; dog lovers should not tease dogs easily; and ensure the safety of people who are afraid of dogs. Safety and benefits.&quot; Wu Qi, a senior pet behavior expert, founder of China&#39;s PFH (Paw For Heal) therapy dog ​​charity project, and designer of pet-friendly co-creation spaces, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How is a pet-friendly space friendly? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are more and more pet dogs. Some people regard them as companions, while others avoid them. Both those who are afraid of dogs and dog owners feel that the surrounding environment is &quot;not friendly enough&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2022 China Pet Industry White Paper&quot; report released by Paidu Pet Industry Big Data Platform shows that the number of dogs and cats in cities and towns in 2022 will be 117 million, and there will be 34.12 million pet dog owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When reminding owners of unleashed dogs, Luo Youyou often hears the answer: &quot;Our dogs are small and don&#39;t bite.&quot; Liu Doudou likes to travel with her Bichon Frize, but she can only choose to drive herself because she is afraid of harm caused by checking it in. In major domestic tourist cities, she found that few hotels allow pets. In Wuhan, where she lives, dogs are almost not allowed to walk on river beaches, greenways, and city parks within the third ring road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some cities are trying to change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paris began allowing dogs into city parks in 2019, with the number of pet-friendly parks rising from 70 to 400. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Shanghai, the Xuhui Riverside on the west bank of the Huangpu River is regarded as a dog-walking paradise by many &quot;poop shovelers&quot;. On weekday evenings, many young people with their furry children also gather for &quot;City Walk&quot;. First let go of the leash in the &quot;Cute Pet Paradise&quot; and let the dog run freely - it is separated by a fence and surrounded by a metal guardrail, which distinguishes the dog walking areas for large and small and medium-sized dogs; after exercising, put on the leash and take the dog with you. Take your dog to a cafe not far away to get a cup of edible pet cream; go to a restaurant marked as pet-friendly to dine outdoors and exchange &quot;pet-raising experiences&quot; with other dog owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Near the Xuhui Riverside Greenbelt in Shanghai, there are many pet-friendly restaurants that allow customers to bring their pets to dine.

Therefore, to achieve &quot;two-way friendship&quot; between people and pets, establishing rules is a prerequisite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that restrictions on pet size, breeds and entry methods are the basic principles of pet-friendly spaces, which are reflected in the &quot;Pet Service Standards&quot; and &quot;Pet-Friendly Convention&quot; posted on site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some pet-friendly restaurants divide the space, isolate special pet-friendly dining areas, and remind customers that &quot;this restaurant accepts pets for dining in specific areas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The front desk of Guangzhou Mandarin Oriental Hotel told Southern Weekend reporters that in order to eliminate the concerns of guests who are afraid of dogs, hotel service staff will remind and supervise pet owners not to let dogs land in public areas, and place them at the door of the room where pets are staying. There is a pet check-in reminder sign. After check-out, the room where the pet has stayed will be deeply disinfected, and an additional cleaning fee of 933 yuan/time will be charged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pet Friendly 3&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/b1dbb387db.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2429&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/b1dbb387db.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255534&quot;>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Pet Friendly Space Rules. Compiled by Southern Weekend reporter Huang Siqi. Drawing by Liang Shuyi&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even in Shanghai, there are still only a few communities with a strong pet-friendly atmosphere. Feng Yun found that &quot;most parks are still closed to dogs, and Lucky rarely has the opportunity to run free. Living in the city has restricted his nature.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, pet-friendly spaces are not complicated. Zhang Jingyuan, an assistant professor at the School of Architecture of Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), suggested that it can be carried out around the four levels of food, water, sanitation and activity space, paying attention to the separation of humans and dogs and the isolation of large, medium and small breeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Ling, a professor at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning of Chongqing University, believes that when community space is limited, an area of ​​3-4 square meters can be appropriately divided to build a fence for pets to &quot;have fun&quot;. &quot;The key to a pet-specific activity space is &#39;having&#39; rather than &#39;big&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Allowing pets to enter is only the first friendly step&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Allowing pets to enter&quot; is only the first step For a space that advertises itself as “pet-friendly”, there is also a question mark as to whether its regulations can be strictly followed and truly “pet-friendly”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member of the AI ​​PLAZA West Bund Fengchao Marketing Department told Southern Weekend reporters that a customer who entered the mall’s pet-friendly restaurant to dine did not put their pet in a cart but on a dining chair. Later, we received complaints from some customers: &quot;You gave people back the chairs that dogs had sat on.&quot; Walking dogs in shopping malls requires the correct use of pet strollers, but there are still a few customers who habitually let their dogs walk. When mall security comes to stop them, sometimes there will be disputes, &quot;Since it is a pet-friendly shopping mall, why can&#39;t you walk dogs?&quot; “Some customers don’t even have leashes and let their dogs roam around the mall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member said that complying with the pet-friendly regulations of shopping malls mainly depends on the customer&#39;s consciousness. The mall can only provide reminders and suggestions. Fortunately, most customers can adjust their behavior in time after being reminded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is currently no unified standard for pet-friendly spaces. Southern Weekend reporters consulted as consumers and found that the requirements of different hotels vary greatly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Guangzhou only allows non-venomous dogs under 10 kilograms and a shoulder height of less than 40 centimeters to stay, and it is not mandatory to check pet IDs. Hyatt Regency Beijing Wangjing allows dogs under 30 kilograms to stay, and there are no breed requirements. Dog licenses and vaccination certificates must be brought when checking in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before taking her Bichon Frize on a trip, Liu Doudou used to use travel software to filter for &quot;pet-friendly&quot; hotels. Since each hotel has different requirements, she would call the hotel to confirm again before placing the order. Some hotels were labeled as pet-friendly, but after learning that Liu Doudou was traveling with a Bichon Frize, they refused to accept guests on the grounds that “Bichon Frize Frize Frize Frize Frize Dogs shed hair.” “In fact, Bichon Frize Frize Frize Frize Dogs do not shed easily unless they are combed. I pulled hard. The hotel staff didn’t know much about dogs, but I had no choice but to find another home.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pet Friendly 1&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/6355cc5c5f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;744&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/6355cc5c5f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255535&quot;>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;On December 4, 2022 local time, the International Dog Show was held in Seoul, South Korea. The Bear Dog is undergoing breed standard review. Visual China | Picture&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind pet-friendliness is the pet economy. iiMedia Research data shows that China’s pet market will reach 592.8 billion yuan in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first pet-friendly shopping mall in Xiamen, Xiamen Jianfa Bay Yuecheng has held a cute pet dating party for three consecutive years, including a challenge competition and other activities. Wang Zijia, professional manager of Jianfa Bay Yue City Planning and pet-friendly project leader, told Southern Weekend reporters that the Pet Activity Festival held in March 2023 will double the passenger flow to the mall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pet-related activities attract customers, but the professionalism of some activities needs to be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Qi discovered that five or six years ago, the &quot;Pet Big Eater Competition&quot; was popular in shopping malls in first-tier cities in China, where they competed to see who could finish dog food faster. The activity is very popular with dog food manufacturers, but it ignores the damage to the dog&#39;s body. If a dog participates in running and jumping activities after overeating, there is a risk of gastric torsion, which may be life-threatening in severe cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At present, pet eating competitions have basically disappeared, but many pet-friendly businesses still like to hold pet obstacle races. The appearance of pets trying to pass through the obstacles can make people laugh, but for pet dogs without professional training , the owner’s forceful tugging will only keep them in a state of shock throughout the process,” Wu Qi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Regard pets as equal beings&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When I met a cute pet dog on the road, I couldn’t help but stare into its eyes and touch its head. You think you are showing kindness to your dog, but the feedback you receive may be aggression from the dog, even if it is a breed known for its docility. Because in unfamiliar situations, the behavior of touching the head and looking directly at the dog can easily be interpreted as hostility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be truly pet-friendly, hardware facilities are not enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Ling told Southern Weekend reporters that the premise of creating a pet-friendly space is to conceptually regard pets as equal living individuals that are dependent on humans, and their behavioral habits should be systematically studied. Fully understand and respect their daily needs. Taking the &quot;unity, health and peaceful coexistence&quot; of humans, animals and the environment as the basic principle for creating urban public spaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data released by the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention show that from January to August 2023, the number of people exposed to dog injuries in the city reached 149,000, due to licking, scratching or bites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Qi believes that the problem of human-canine conflict does not lie with dogs, but with people. For dog owners, dogs need to be socialized. Pet dogs that are unfriendly to people or even behave aggressively often have not been socialized and have not received good etiquette education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called socialization training means that during the golden period of 2-4 months of dog age, it is fully exposed to different environments, familiar with different spaces, smells and people, so as to adapt to urban life. &quot;Dogs that have missed the best period of socialization and haven&#39;t gone out for a long time are afraid of the outside world. Even a docile Labrador may bite people.&quot; Wu Qi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Liu Doudou travels with his pet, he always carries the dog&#39;s water bowl, food bowl, food plate and sleeping mat with him. After long-term dog walking and education, the nearly two-year-old Bichon Frize has maintained good hygiene habits and has never peed indoors or soiled the facilities in the hotel room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When walking his dog in the community, Liu Doudou kept the leash on him the whole time. &quot;In places with many people and cars, the leash is also for the safety of the puppy.&quot; When encountering pet dogs without leashes, she would sometimes argue with their owners. “Dogs tend to fight with each other, but some owners don’t take it seriously. They also say that their dogs never bite. If you have a puppy, you should treat a puppy well.” You must be responsible for life to the end, you must protect and guide, and you must also prevent puppies from hurting people.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jingyuan believes that pet-friendliness is a progressive process that extends from pet owners to commercial institutions, non-profit organizations and even government agencies, gradually affecting the public and forming a social consensus. The stigma against pets and stray cats and dogs mainly comes from fear of the unknown, and eliminating fear must rely on extensive science popularization and public participation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, her daughter, who has just turned one year old, still likes to get close to puppies on the roadside. Luo Youyou neither wants her to be as afraid of dogs as she is, but also does not dare to let her have direct contact with dogs. Wu Qi said that dogs that have been well socialized are safe in contact with children, but they also need guidance from parents.

Pogba, the team’s top star and a world-record transfer fee, was on the bench. After watching the game, he underwent a drug test after the game. On September 12, the Italian Anti-Doping Agency announced that Pogba tested positive for drugs and would be temporarily suspended. Subsequently, his B bottle still detected dehydroepiandrosterone. The only good thing is that this substance is widely used in health products and there is a possibility of accidental ingestion. Pogba is currently still investigating what he took during the summer and is waiting for the final punishment. The most optimistic estimate is that he will be suspended for 3-6 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One wave has not subsided, and a bigger wave is coming. This time the protagonists are three young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faccioli, 22 years old, the best rookie in Serie A in the 2022-23 season, comes from Serie A giant Juventus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tonali, 23 years old, is the &quot;Prince&quot; of Serie A giant AC Milan. He will join the upstart Newcastle United in the Premier League in the summer of 2023 with a transfer fee of 70 million euros. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zaniolo, 24 years old, was once praised as Totti&#39;s successor at Roma Club and now plays for the Premier League powerhouse Aston Villa. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that the future is very good, but this is just the glamor on the surface. On the other hand, he is addicted to gambling and even bets on his own team&#39;s games. For this, he has incurred huge debts and has been threatened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was the famous paparazzi Corona who started this controversy. In August, he revealed that many Italian players gambled. Because he had so many misdeeds, not many people took him seriously at first. In fact, Fagioli was questioned by Turin prosecutors on June 23, and he subsequently surrendered to the sports prosecutor&#39;s office. He admitted that he had bet on many football games: from the Champions League, Serie A, La Liga, Premier League, to Serie B, Serie C and Turkish Super League, but he had never bet on Juventus. His behavior crossed the line. In Italy, betting is legal, but football players are not allowed to bet on football matches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fagioli said that he lost more than he won when gambling, and owed more and more money to gambling websites. The debt was about 3 million euros. Some of these websites were overseas. The operators forced him to pay back the money and threatened him. Said to break his legs. He also said that when he was in the National Youth Team, it was his teammate Tonali who suggested that he go to those websites to place bets. He heard that Tonali owed a lot of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tonali is currently the most valuable Italian player. At the end of September, the newly appointed Italian team coach Spalletti announced the squad and Tonali was selected. Spalletti&#39;s predecessor, Mancini, originally had a high reputation, but suddenly resigned on August 13, citing interference in his work by the chairman of the Football Association. Soon after, he went to Saudi Arabia to coach the national team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Corona exposed Faccioli, he also revealed the names of Tonali and Zaniolo. When the new Italian team was training, at the suggestion of the Turin prosecutor, the police went to the Covelciano base to question Tonali and Zaniolo. They were accompanied by the team leader Buffon when he played. He has also been accused of illegal betting. According to a report in La Repubblica, the two people almost cried in front of the police, and their mobile phones and tablets were confiscated by the police. The two soon left Coverciano, and the Italian Football Association stated in a statement that the two did not meet the necessary conditions for training and playing, allowing them to return to their respective clubs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faccioli has been suspended for 7 months. Tonali and Zaniolo are still under investigation. Tonali initially denied and then admitted that he had bet on Milan games. Zaniolo The situation is relatively optimistic. He firmly stated that he was only playing cards on an illegal website and no evidence of his gambling has been found so far. According to the whistleblower Corona, there are still many Serie A players on the blacklist. Is Serie A in trouble? Or is it always the same, no fuss? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After World War II, Serie A quickly developed into the most developed professional league in Europe, relying on internal factors such as economic prosperity and people&#39;s love for football, as well as external factors such as English League One&#39;s salary limit and the lack of the Bundesliga. The boss spends huge sums of money on the stars, the income of coaches and players is second to none in Europe, and the team has a brilliant record in European competitions. Starting in 1963, the two teams of Milan City won the Champions League four times in the 1960s. Also in 1963, Italy&#39;s industrial production increased by 209% compared with 1950, with an average annual growth rate of 9.1%, second only to Japan among major capitalist countries. The influx of money, the cruelty of professional football, and the huge interests involved in winning championships, rankings, and relegations have led to a desperate mentality for victory, and a large number of improper behaviors have occurred in Italian football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/uOv9Sbd8cPKJdCCM8B2hEAFZ8VtABp36MZDHtK6L.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;686&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/uOv9Sbd8cPKJdCCM8B2hEAFZ8VtABp36MZDHtK6L.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255281&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tonali is under investigation for betting on football. He will move from Serie A team AC Milan to Premier League team Newcastle in the summer of 2023, with a transfer fee of 70 million euros &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Buying opponents&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the last round of Serie A in the 1952-53 season, Patria, which had been relegated early, faced Udinese, who needed to avoid relegation. When Patria led 2-0, players Fossati and Manucci told several teammates that Udinese wanted to win this game and was willing to pay. Patria then played poorly, conceding three goals in a row and losing the game. Udinese successfully avoided relegation. Several &quot;cooperating&quot; Patria players received money at a paper mill in Milan, about 150,000 lire each. They continued to play for the next two seasons, and could have played safely until retirement, but Patria&#39;s loss in November 1954 was investigated, which led to the previous match-fixing behavior. Team member Cetambrino admitted what he did during the previous loss to Udinese. In August 1955, Udinese was demoted to Serie B. Several players involved were punished. Some could no longer play football, and some were suspended for 3 years. Setambrino was only suspended for half a year because he cooperated with the judicial department. After retiring, he became a coach. Catania was also relegated along with Udinese. Their crime was to bribe the referee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After less than three years of calm, the &quot;Achini incident&quot; occurred in Serie A in the 1957-58 season. Because of match-fixing, Padua player Achini was banned for life (later commuted), and Atalanta was demoted to the last place in Serie A, thus falling into Serie B. A similar situation soon occurred again, and Genoa was severely punished in 1960. In April 1960, they were in a critical situation of relegation. Retired former international player Gino Capello acted as a broker. Before the game between Genoa and Atalanta, he found his former teammate Atalanta player Catozzo and left 1 million lire. , hope Atlanta loses to Genoa. Catozzo pretended to agree and then immediately informed Vice President Tentorio, who in turn contacted the investigative department. At the end of the season, Genoa ranked bottom with only 18 points and was relegated to Serie B. The bad luck of relegation cannot be avoided. The Italian Football Federation determined that they had committed illegal activities and deducted 25 points for this reason. So Genoa started playing Serie B with minus 7 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/8Bmy8KcXY8HCyNjLApGByXkoYzjOOb9jC0ajP2gN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/8Bmy8KcXY8HCyNjLApGByXkoYzjOOb9jC0ajP2gN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255280&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fagioli, who plays for Serie A team Juventus, was suspended for seven months for betting on football&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Doping testing suspicions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;These improper behaviors are the dark side of Serie A. In some aspects, Serie A is very advanced, such as doping testing. The Bundesliga in 1988 Post-match drug testing only began in 2018. In February 1964, Bologna defeated Turin 4-1 and achieved ten consecutive Serie A victories. After the game, five players from each team took drug tests. In early March, the test results were announced. Five of Bologna&#39;s players were all positive and tested positive for amphetamines. For this reason, the win against Turin was changed to a loss, and one point was deducted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bologna is very dissatisfied because the suspicion is obvious: the amphetamine content in the urine sample is too high, so high that it can cause death, and no one can bear it. After three lawyers filed a complaint with the prosecutor&#39;s office, prosecutors ordered the urine samples to be seized. The urine sample was retested, and this time the problem was complicated: amphetamine was not detected, so there must have been some manipulation before; no one knew who did it and what the motive was. Many years later, Bologna&#39;s team doctor mentioned a name: Milan&#39;s technical director Viani. This season, Milan and Bologna once formed a competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, with three rounds left in Serie A, the penalty against Bologna was cancelled, and they were tied for first place with Inter Milan. After the last three rounds, the two teams have the same points. According to the rules, they have to play the play-offs at a neutral site. Before the game, the presidents of the two clubs, Bologna&#39;s Dalala and Inter Milan&#39;s Moratti, came to the league headquarters to discuss the details of the game. When the two were arguing about the game bonus, Dalala suffered a heart attack and died unfortunately. Four days later, his Bologna side beat Inter Milan to win the Serie A title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inter Milan lost the Serie A title this season, won the Champions League, and defeated Benfica at San Siro a year later to retain the Champions League. They have a luxurious lineup and excellent record. They are known as the big Inter Milan, but their reputation is not good: their victory depends on chain defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6XOCslE9MB6cZIao8TIMM5qhnX1wgwmaD3Plp344.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;601&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6XOCslE9MB6cZIao8TIMM5qhnX1wgwmaD3Plp344.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255278&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2006, Juventus executive director Giraudo (left) and manager Moggi (right) watched head coach Capello (middle) leading the team to train&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Style and Morality&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chain defense originally refers to a line of defense , the method is to set up free men and implement man-to-man marking to protect the safety of the goal to the greatest extent, and then it has become a symbol of a mentality and football style: passive, utilitarian, giving up possession of the ball, only caring about the result, not caring about the scene, and even using any means. The 1965 Champions League final is an excellent example of the chain defense: Inter Milan&#39;s Pizzi played as a free man, with three defenders in front of him, plus a defensive midfielder. Before the end of the first half, Inter Milan scored a goal, and then Benfica&#39;s goalkeeper was injured and came off the field. Since there was no substitution rule, they could only let defender Germano guard the goal. Facing an opponent with one less player, Inter Milan continued to defend, just wanting to maintain its lead, and finally achieved its wish to win the championship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This championship is of extraordinary significance, symbolizing that Italian football has formed its own style.这样的进程，无论树立还是改变，时间方面至少需要10-15年，成绩方面需要冠军，执教方面需要摆脱对外籍教练的依赖，语言方面需要创造一个概念来涵盖和呈现这种风格，并有人充当吹鼓手和阐释者，这个人只能是名记布雷拉。 1946年意甲恢复；1957-58赛季开始时，意甲中见不到匈牙利教练的身影；1960年，维亚尼带领意大利队参加罗马奥运会，自由人战术在国家队扎下根，沿用多年，直到1994年世界杯，意大利队才在大赛中放弃自由人；1963年的冠军杯决赛中，米兰的皮瓦特利对本菲卡的科卢纳犯规，那一脚终结了冠军杯的纯真年代，也帮助意大利球队第一次夺得冠军杯；随后是国际米兰两夺冠军杯。这一切为链式防守奠定了地位，这个名号成了意大利足球的代名词，难以割裂，延续至今。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每个国家都要走这段路，为自己的足球寻找、摸索和确定风格，其中免不了一些不光彩的做法，谁家都有丢人现眼的时候。意大利足球的特别之处在于，树立风格时足球美学逊色很多，在内部，挺有追求的贝尔纳蒂尼影响力不如罗科、埃雷拉等人；于外部，难以匹敌荷兰的全能足球、巴西的美丽足球；而且在道德方面不够高尚，为了赢，什么都干，什么都不在乎。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Z5OZ4tgPFC9VzVqEgaERzBzKs8QzXYZI4IAazdB4.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;除了战术保守，意大利球队还受到服用禁药、收买裁判、使用盘外招等指责。 1966年冠军杯半决赛，国际米兰不敌皇马，匈牙利裁判瓦达斯执法了次回合，他一丝不苟、不偏不倚，皇马1-1打平国米，从而以2-1的总比分晋级。数年后瓦达斯向记者透露，国际米兰的掮客索尔蒂找过他，他拒绝了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个索尔蒂也是匈牙利人，他不只为国际米兰服务。 1973年冠军杯半决赛，尤文图斯淘汰了德比郡，首回合结束后，德比郡教练帅克拉夫极不服气，破口大骂。他的愤怒不是没来由，索尔蒂给次回合的裁判、葡萄牙人洛博送了5000美元和一辆汽车，洛博没有收受，并且上报，公正地执法了次回合，但首回合的损失已经无可挽回。后来英国名记格兰威尔前往葡萄牙等地调查，拿到了真实有力的证据，1974年《星期日泰晤士报》将之公布于世。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1974年意大利足球正处于低谷，全年国家队只赢了一场，是在世界杯上击败弱旅海地。之前两年的冠军杯决赛，国际米兰和尤文图斯都输给阿贾克斯，而且场面完全处于下风，没有一丝赢球机会。随后在贝尔佐特和拉迪切等教练的带领下，意大利足球开始战术革新，并且在1980年重新对外援打开大门。就在外援禁令即将解除、前景一片光明时，意甲又曝出假球丑闻，即托托内罗事件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/WLN5tfiUnHrWbSO3DhufVC6PWaVo68JzuXmF6bdz.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;1982年7月11日，西班牙世界杯决赛，意大利队以3比1战胜西德队，保罗·罗西举起奖杯庆祝夺冠&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;假球没演好&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;导火索是两位商人的告发。他俩认识一些拉齐奥球员，于是想出商机，决定跟球员合谋，通过操纵比赛和非法投注来赚钱，拉齐奥球员同意了。第一次尝试是1979年11月的一场友谊赛，按事先说好的踢成平局，可随后很多场次没有踢出预设结果，导致两人损失了很多钱，还受到债主的威胁。两人走投无路，也忍无可忍，向检察官提交了一份报告，列出13支球队和27名球员的名字。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;意大利财政卫队随后采取行动。 1980年3月23日，拉齐奥同佩斯卡拉的意甲比赛，财政卫队开车开入罗马奥林匹克球场的跑道，这一幕震惊了全国。随后多名球员被捕或自首，涉及五支意甲球队和两支意乙球队，米兰俱乐部主席科伦波也被警方带走。最后意甲球队米兰和拉齐奥被罚入乙级，多名球员遭禁赛，其中名气最大的是保罗·罗西，起初他被禁赛三年，随后减为两年，刚好赶上1982年世界杯，他打入六球，为意大利队夺冠立下大功。但所有被捕人员均被无罪释放，因为当时意大利的法律不健全，这些人没有违法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;意甲对外援解禁后，罗马引进巴西球星法尔考，随后又招募了他的同胞塞雷佐。他们在1984年打入冠军杯决赛，在点球大战中不敌利物浦。这场决赛没有争议，肮脏行为出现在半决赛。首回合罗马在客场输给邓迪联，次回合前，他们付给法国名哨米歇尔·乌图1亿里拉，最后以3-0赢了，第3球是可疑的点球，引起外界的广泛质疑。在罗马俱乐部内部，买通乌图是公开的秘密，两年后，罗马主席维奥拉因为贿赂裁判而被欧足联禁赛，他的儿子在多年后公开讲述了给乌图送钱的细节。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1984年冠军杯决赛，罗马输了，一年后，尤文图斯赢了，在队史上第一次赢得这座奖杯，也是意大利球队时隔16年后再次捧杯，标志着意甲的复兴。随后贝卢斯科尼的米兰成为意甲冠军和欧洲霸主，7年5次打入欧冠决赛，3次夺冠。凭借米兰俱乐部的影响力，贝卢斯科尼还当上总理。他进入政界的一个目的是为了逃脱法律制裁，得逞后明目张胆利用政治运作来为自己和公司提供保护，谁都知道他胡作非为，但除了谴责没什么办法。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;禁药、电话门和假账门&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;尤文图斯第二次夺得冠军杯是在1996年，当时他们的体能之好令人惊叹。 1998年7月，罗马主帅泽曼在接受采访时指责意甲中有人服用禁药，他点了维亚利和皮耶罗的名字，认为两人的肌肉是靠服药长出来的。意大利司法部门开始了长达6年的调查，最后在2004年11月，都灵地方法院宣判，尤文图斯医疗主管阿格里科拉监禁22个月，缓期执行。法院认为，1994至1998年间，他让多位尤文图斯球员服用了EPO（促红细胞生长素），但队员并不知情。除了阿格里科拉，其他人都安然无恙。尤文图斯执行董事吉拉乌多被判无罪，他表示判决还了自己清白，尤文图斯是无辜的，而阿格里科拉将继续做尤文图斯的队医。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吉拉乌多没高兴多久。 2006年5月4日，《米兰体育报》刊登出尤文图斯经理莫吉跟意甲裁判分配人的通话内容，震惊了意大利足坛。莫吉很快承认自己贿赂裁判和足协官员，包括莫吉和吉拉乌多在内，尤文图斯董事会集体辞职，意大利足协的主席和副主席也引咎辞职。意大利体育法庭将尤文图斯罚入乙级，两个意甲冠军被剥夺，米兰、佛罗伦萨和拉齐奥受到扣分的惩处。吉拉乌多也受到处罚，此后他一直没有放弃，希望重新审理，2020年他向欧洲人权法院提出上诉，最近在程序上有了进展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吉拉乌多为自己奔走时，老东家尤文图斯已经经历了电话门之后的又一次处罚。这次的罪行是财务造假，为此被扣掉7个意甲积分，跟从前的莫吉、吉拉乌多一样，时任主席安德雷亚·阿涅利带领管理层集体辞职。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回顾意大利足坛的风波和不光彩，有些是因为没有及时引入和修改法律，导致一些人逃过了牢狱之灾，鼓励了其他人；有些是因为采取的先进措施被不法者利用；有些是权贵过于自信，肆无忌惮，藐视规则和舆论；还有些行为是普适的，是人性使然，比如打假球和服用禁药，德国教练诺伊吕勒在2007年说，自己在执教沙尔克04时亲眼见过有球员服用芬乃他林，“这不是什么秘密，都成了惯例。这已经成了足球运动的一部分，50%的球员都在使用这种药物。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;意大利国家队在2021年夺得欧洲杯，带来了短暂提振，随后意大利足球又陷入低谷，遭到打击。最新发生的年轻球员非法赌球，反映和参与了意大利的当下：经济面临难关，行政体系低效，一些社会问题解决无望。法国学者布洛赫说，一个人像他生活的年代，胜过像他的父亲。一个国家的足球也是如此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

Some people attribute it to Yangming&#39;s philosophy of &quot;talking about harming the country&quot;. After the Ding Revolution, the survivors of the Ming Dynasty learned from the pain, reflected on the historical lessons of the country&#39;s subjugation, and believed that &quot;Wang Xue&quot; was one of the culprits. The most representative figure among them is Gu Yanwu. In his article &quot;The Master&#39;s Words and the Way of Heaven&quot;, He denounced Wang Xue&#39;s &quot;empty words of understanding one&#39;s mind and one&#39;s nature, replacing the practical knowledge of cultivating oneself and governing others&quot;, which resulted in &quot;the collapse of the Chinese state and the ruins of clans and societies!&quot; Famous Confucian scholars such as Zhang Luxiang, Lu Longqi, Lu Shiyi, and Xiong Cilu all expressed this opinion. , and advocated the revitalization of Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism and the application of practical knowledge to correct the shortcomings of Wang Xue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Chengzhi, a survivor of the Ming Dynasty, said unceremoniously in a letter to Gu Yanwu&#39;s nephew Xu Yuanwen that Gu Yanwu&#39;s denigration of Yangming&#39;s studies was just a remnant of the spit of an old student in Wujiang, and had no factual basis. , very emotional. Some modern scholars have expressed doubts about Gu&#39;s statement. The author believes that the &quot;Wang Xue theory of subjugation of the country&quot; is divorced from the facts and is the product of the party struggle at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/dE644zekk4itpgNoM2BQWeY7aFJ8XwkF3LS0IQYz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1790&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/dE644zekk4itpgNoM2BQWeY7aFJ8XwkF3LS0IQYz.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255083&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The statue of Gu Yan is in the collection of the National Museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, theoretically speaking, Yangming&#39;s philosophy of mind is not a study of mysterious emptiness and emptiness as Gu and others said, but a study of practical application of the world. In his &quot;Reply to Gu Dongqiao&quot;, Yangming criticized &quot;those stubborn, empty and quiet people&quot; who &quot;cannot govern the country and the world&quot;, and advocated &quot;practicing one&#39;s work&quot; and integrating knowledge and action. He publicly declared that he disdained the study of exegesis, memorization, and verses. He said that practicing verses was &quot;as if he were on the stage of a hundred plays.&quot; It&#39;s shameful.&quot; Wang Yangming had the ambition to help the world since he was a child. He studied riding and archery, and studied the art of war. He once went deep outside the Great Wall to inspect geography. The most outstanding sign of his integration of knowledge and action was the application of the art of mind to military practice. According to his disciple Wang Ji&#39;s &quot;Yu Yu&quot; Recalling the article &quot;Xu Jiang&quot;: When I asked my former master what was the secret behind the saying that he was like a god in using troops, the master said: &quot;I have no secret skills, but I have always believed in conscience. Whenever I take advantage of the opportunity to face the enemy, I only have this little bit of spiritual intelligence and spiritual response.&quot; , I am not moved by the interests of life and death, so my plans are carefully planned, and the enemy does not know where he is coming. I am originally a person who practices my duty, but the world mistakenly thinks that I am a god.&quot; Volume 4 of He Liangjun&#39;s &quot;Siyou Zhaicong Shuo&quot; concludes : Wang Yangming said, &quot;The military is based on lectures and tactics are used, and the administration is based on lectures and political skills.&quot; The mutual complementation of academics and achievements enabled Yangming to achieve great success in the military. During the Jiajing period, in response to the imperial court&#39;s outright rejection of Yangming&#39;s scholarship, Huang Wan pointed out that the essence of Yangming&#39;s scholarship was &quot;to consider what people say and do, and not to just talk in vain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, from a practical point of view, many disciples of the Wang Sect and their followers have made achievements that will be remembered by future generations. Yangming did not regard knowledge as the only criterion for accepting disciples. Among his disciples were potters, farmers, woodcutter, etc. There were knights who &quot;fighted dragons and snakes with bare hands&quot;, counselors who made plans, and generals who led troops in war. For example, Hu Zongxian, a disciple of Ouyang De, led the army and people of Zhejiang to fight against Japanese invaders, and planned to capture and kill the great Japanese pirates Wang Zhi and Xu Hai to quell the Japanese invaders in Zhejiang and Zhejiang. Weng Wanda, governor of Shaanxi and governor of Xuanda, was one of the coffin bearers when Wang Yangming was buried. He was friendly with Yangming&#39;s disciples Ouyang De, Luo Hongxian, Tang Shunzhi, Wang Ji and others. Weng Wanda was in charge of the northern border defense for five or six years, and made outstanding achievements in fighting against the invasion of Mongolia. Guo Zizhang, a disciple of Ouyang De, patrolled Guizhou in the 26th year of Wanli (1598). He worked with Li Hualong to suppress Yang Yinglong&#39;s rebellion in Bozhou and was known as the first famous official in central Guizhou. Luo Rufang, a student of Yan Jun, was criticized by people in the early Qing Dynasty for &quot;talking about nothing&quot;. In fact, he visited many places to study and inspect society in his early years. In the early years of Wanli, the imperial court adopted a policy of appeasement against the expansion and aggression of the Burmese king. According to the &quot;Bureau&quot;, Luo Rufang, who was then the right political participant in Yunnan, planned to encircle the Mang clan of the Burmese king. However, his success fell short because someone slandered the governor Wang Ning. Luo Rufang &quot; He threw himself to the ground in anger and cursed loudly.&quot; This caused serious trouble, and the Burmese army invaded Yunnan in a large scale. Li Cai, who had studied under Zou Shouyi, wiped out pirates and Japanese pirates when he was in Guangdong; when he was in Yunnan, he defeated the Burmese invasion. Luo Hongxian, the number one scholar of the Private Shu Wang Yangming, is described in the original &quot;History of the Ming Dynasty&quot; as &quot;leaping his horse and drawing his bow, examining the history through research&quot;. The rivers and canals, frontier fortresses, battle formations, offenses and defenses, etc. are not studied in detail. Shunzhi of Tang Dynasty in Huiyuan Dynasty, who &quot;heard the words of conscience from Wang Ji&quot;, is said in the &quot;History of Ming Dynasty&quot; to &quot;know everything about learning&quot; and pay special attention to practical learning. He &quot;never forgot the world and the country in his heart&quot;, and until his deathbed, he still thought about the safety of the country and did not care about his private affairs. In the thirty-sixth year of Jiajing&#39;s reign (1557), Zhao Wenhua, a member of Yan Song&#39;s party, supervised the military affairs of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and recommended him as the chief of the Nanjing Ministry of War. Shun Zhi put the country first, regardless of the tarnished reputation, and resolutely came out of the mountain. He inspected Jizhen, verified the number of troops, and put forward many practical suggestions. He also assisted Hu Zongxian in fighting against Japanese invaders, patrolled the sea to inspect the situation of bandits, formulated strategies to attack, intercept and block the enemy, and personally commanded and won great victories such as Yaojiadang. The famous anti-Japanese generals Tan Lun, Yu Dayou, Qi Jiguang, Liu Xian, etc. were all appreciated and promoted by him. In addition, Yan Jun, Xu Wei, disciples of the Wang family, and Zheng Ruozeng, who was influenced by Yangming&#39;s psychology, all served in the Hu Zongxian shogunate and made their own contributions to the pacification of Japan in different ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many military generals with great military exploits are also disciples of the Wang Clan. For example, Governor Wanbiao got his philosophical ideas from Wang Ji, Luo Hongxian, Qian Dehong and Tang Shunzhi. He once personally led the monk soldiers to fight against the Japanese pirates at Yangjing Bridge in Suzhou, and was hit by an arrow without leaving the line of fire. Yu Dayou followed Yangming&#39;s Xinxue in his early years and later studied under Tang Shunzhi. Qi Jiguang was also &quot;a private person of Shu Yangming and a great expounder of conscience&quot;. He once entered Qian Dehong&#39;s family, and Qian Dehong recommended him to Hu Zongxian. Qi Jiguang advocated taking &quot;sincerity&quot; as the work force, &quot;practicing it personally&quot;, and focusing on &quot;treating the mind&quot; in military training. Deng Zilong learned from Luo Hong before he became an official, and he kept it in mind throughout his life. He fought in all directions and made many meritorious deeds. Later, in the war to aid Korea, even though he was nearly seventy years old, he fought bravely to kill the enemy and sacrificed his life for the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from this that since the Ming Dynasty, everyone in the Wang family has been a person of great achievements. On the other hand, among the Donglin Party members, except for loyal and honest ministers, there are very few capable ministers in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the grim reality of &quot;the sky collapsed and the earth collapsed&quot; in the late Ming Dynasty, the Donglin Party members mistakenly blamed Wang Xue and believed that Zhu Zixue was the panacea to save the world. They criticize the corrupt Confucians for being &quot;ignorant of affairs and current affairs. They harm one person, harm the whole family, harm one country, and harm the whole world.&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of Donglin Academy· Donglin Theory of Learning&quot;) This is precisely the self-portrait of the Donglin Party members. The Taizhou School founded by Wang Gen, a disciple of Yangming, has long pointed out that &quot;human relations physics&quot; and &quot;common people&#39;s daily needs&quot; are Tao, and the disciples of Cheng and Zhu are the corrupt Confucians who &quot;do not understand affairs and are not familiar with current affairs.&quot; In the second year of Duanping in the Southern Song Dynasty (1234), the Neo-Confucian master Zhen Dexiu paid homage to Zhen Dexiu to consult on political affairs. People had high expectations for him, thinking that he could establish peace. However, after Zhen Dexiu took office, Prime Minister Zheng Qingzhi did nothing and could not save the declining Southern Song Dynasty. Therefore, the Yuan people&#39;s cancellation of the imperial examination for a time had something to do with the empty talk of Song Confucianism that harmed the country. Song Lian, the leader of civil servants in the early Ming Dynasty, advocated the use of Confucianism, but he had to admit in the &quot;Biography of Wu Deji&quot; that Song Confucianism could not do much more in promoting Confucianism, but in the end he did not make much difference to the world. By the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism was on the verge of &quot;dying to death&quot; because the late Neo-Confucianists &quot;only discussed it in footnotes&quot;. In &quot;Remembering the Past&quot;, Li Zhi mocked the pedantic Confucians who &quot;have nothing to do in daily life, only do bows and bows, sit on the ground all day long, like clay sculptures and think that they cannot afford distracting thoughts, then they are the real great sages and great sages.&quot; And &quot;when there is a police officer, they look at each other with no color, and even blame each other, thinking they can be wise.&quot; In &quot;The Biography of Mr. Yangming, the Confucian Prince of the Ming Dynasty&quot;, the scholar Shen Shixing sharply criticized those who attacked Wang Yangming: &quot;Most of the Confucian officials in modern times take it for granted that they are well-dressed and well-dressed, but when it comes to their daily use, they often suffer from rigidity and nothing.&quot; To make achievements; to study extensively and listen in order to learn, but to find out the actual results, they are often obsessed with what they have seen and heard without experiencing, and the customs have been immersed in them for a long time!&quot; This kind of person may be morally impeccable, but he is mediocre and incompetent, and only knows how to die in literature. Advice, fight to the death. Donglin Party members equate morality with ability, and due to the limitations of the times, it is difficult to give a fair definition of &quot;morality&quot;. In the face of foreign aggression, they do not know how to adapt and are immoral. Zhang Luxiang&#39;s &quot;Yuan Xue Ji&quot; says that &quot;Yangming used troops mostly to win by deceit, which Confucians would not do.&quot; University scholar Wang Xijue pointedly pointed out: Zou Yuanbiao, the highly respected moral benchmark in Donglin, is just a &quot;student with simple wishes and no other extraordinary ideas.&quot; There is a shortage of talents in the temple, and there is an urgent need to break down barriers and recruit talents in any way. Zhang Juzheng had long been dissatisfied with the &quot;conventional and vulgar Confucianism&quot; and called for &quot;heroic and true Confucianism&quot;. Jiang Yingke said in &quot;Ancient Theory on Employment&quot;: &quot;To achieve great things, do not pay attention to details; to achieve great achievements, do not pay attention to small righteousness.&quot; Some people even want to select talents from the grassland. Li Zhi especially praised the pirate Lin Daoqian, Zhong In &quot;Preface to Water Margin&quot;, Xing also lamented that &quot;there are no Li Kui or Wu Yong in the world&quot; and &quot;every time I recite the autumn wind, I think of the warriors and shout madly for them.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to corrupt Confucianism, pseudo-Taoism is more harmful. Li Zhi had long criticized the pseudo-Confucianism in &quot;The Theory of the Return of Three Religions to Confucianism&quot; that &quot;yang represents Taoism, yin represents wealth and honor, being subdued by elegance, and behaving like a dog and a pig.&quot; The Donglin Party members adhered to their sectarian views. After taking control of the election, &quot;anyone who disobeys Donglin will be accused of being traitorous.&quot; Later, the society was restored to &quot;hijack the government and control the government from afar.&quot; On the occasion of the change of dynasty, many Donglin Party members &quot;changed their rules and changed their ways&quot;, which was surprising. Therefore, Li Zhi said long ago in &quot;Party Stele&quot;: Secular people &quot;only know that villains can harm the country, but they don&#39;t know that gentlemen can harm the country.&quot; Wei Xi&#39;s &quot;On the Song Dynasty&quot; also said: &quot;The disasters of the country are not caused by villains, but by gentlemen.&quot; They are members of the same party and oppose differences. They do not pursue selfish interests, are interested in fame and profit, and do not hesitate to kill themselves to gain fame. This is what Zhang Tingyu said in &quot;Cheng Huai&quot; It is said in &quot;Yuan Yu&quot; that &quot;killing the remains of parents will lead to the tyranny of the country, loyalty and filial piety, and both will be damaged.&quot; Therefore, some knowledgeable people in the early Qing Dynasty believed that the Ming Dynasty did not fall to rogue bandits, but to Donglin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to partisan factors, &quot;The Theory of Wang Xue Misleading the Country&quot; also has a strong regional flavor. In the Ming Dynasty, the Donglin Party and the Zhejiang Party were at odds with each other. Later, the Zhejiang Party relied on the Eunuch Party, and they even fought to the death. In academic terms, Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism and Lu Wang Xinxue were also on the same page. From the late Ming Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, those who sympathized with the Donglin Party People have the right to speak, and the mainstream ideology is Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism. During the Daoguang period, Liang Shaoren, a native of Qiantang, expressed strong dissatisfaction with this in his &quot;Essays on Two Kinds of Autumn Rains&quot;. He believed that &quot;Wang Wencheng&#39;s achievements are shining brightly, and he is the best of his generation. He only reveals the world with his conscience, which is a little tired of his cleverness, and the debaters are extremely intent on slandering him. How can we say that the world with Ming will not perish by bandits but perish by Yang Ming!&quot; He sighed with emotion: &quot;Today the world is all followers of Zi Yang, no wonder thousands of people gathered together to point it out!&quot; According to Liang Qichao&#39;s &quot;The Recent Three Years of China&quot; According to &quot;A Hundred Years of Academic History&quot;, in the early Qing Dynasty, even righteous men such as Huang Daozhou, Zhang Huangyan, Wang Yi, Qu Shishu, Chen Zizhuang, Zhang Jiayu, etc. who insisted on resisting the Qing Dynasty and restoring the Ming Dynasty did not dare to consider themselves to have &quot;come from the arms of the mother of the Yangming School&quot; &quot;Nurture them out&quot;, but their motivation to resist the Qing Dynasty actually came from the Yangming School. It can be seen that Cheng and Zhu were powerful in the Qing Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[对话上野千鹤子：学术是弱者的武器]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259304]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Who is Chizuru Ueno?

So far, the entries for this conversation have been read 580 million times on the Weibo platform alone, and the topic about Chizuru Ueno has &quot;broken the circle.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was launched in 2019. Prior to this, very few of Chizuru Ueno&#39;s books were published in mainland China, and most of them were circulated in the sociology circle. In 2019, Chizuru Ueno spoke at the opening ceremony of the University of Tokyo. After the video circulated on the Internet, she also gained great popularity in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pbMFkPyJfomiNeKNr1xyLeC0o695DUDJQ7hXLarN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;853&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pbMFkPyJfomiNeKNr1xyLeC0o695DUDJQ7hXLarN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255381&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chizuru Ueno, born in 1948 in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, is a Japanese sociologist and a pioneer in the fields of Japanese women&#39;s studies and gender studies.

Ueno warned the freshmen: &quot;What awaits you in the future will be a society where no matter how hard you work, you may not get a fair reward...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chizuru Ueno was introduced to China in 2015 after a speech at the University of Tokyo sparked discussion. Zi&#39;s ​​old work &quot;Misogyny&quot; was quickly reprinted more than twenty times, becoming an important publishing phenomenon in recent years. Since then, other works by Chizuru Ueno have been introduced and published. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SEwHeYTpgxYro1N6jgVu2AFAc3iQGd594JarO1uR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height= &quot;1621&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SEwHeYTpgxYro1N6jgVu2AFAc3iQGd594JarO1uR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255380&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chizuru Ueno spoke at the opening ceremony of the University of Tokyo in 2019. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the influences of the book &quot;Misogyny&quot; is that &quot;Misogyny&quot; ) such an academic term has been successfully transformed into popular vocabulary. Ueno believes that men often show contempt for women, while women show self-loathing: &quot;If I am 100% not misogynistic, there is no need to be a feminist, because I no longer need to fight. Feminism means constant People who struggle with inner misogyny.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, netizens have often habitually incorporated it into their own life situations to explain the underlying causes of many unpleasant events in life, such as secretly filming women Private photos are uploaded online, gender discrimination in the workplace, product advertising creates body anxiety, celebrities &quot;cheat&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Publisher Chen Xiying published a collection of conversations between Chizuru Ueno and manga artist Nagako Tamafusa in 2021 &quot;From &quot;Feminism from Scratch&quot; has actual sales of more than 200,000 copies and continues to be printed. In Chen Xiying’s impression, after the word feminism entered China, everyone was still relatively unfamiliar with its connotation and denotation. However, &quot;Feminism from Scratch&quot; is a popular work that integrates daily life into Examples are readily available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dialogue in the book basically revolves around women&#39;s &quot;parental shortcomings&quot;, from the length of the skirts of female students&#39; school uniforms to the fact that women are often accused of &quot;revealing clothing&quot; in sexual harassment cases; from the plots of popular TV series to the dilemma of female childbearing; even when talking about the media&#39;s shaping of teenagers, it makes readers realize that the setting of Shizuka in &quot;Doraemon&quot; both attracting men and rebuking men is also a kind of &quot;misogyny&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese publishing industry published seven Ueno books in 2022, including the best-selling book &quot;Starting at the Limit&quot;. Since 2023, Ueno has published more than ten books in China, including serious academic works, as well as relatively light popular readings and dialogue collections. The content covers Chizuru Ueno&#39;s areas of concern in the past forty years. For example, &quot;Women&#39;s Thoughts&quot;, which combs the ideological context of Japanese women&#39;s studies, &quot;Unpaid Housewives&quot;, which cares about the &quot;unpaid&quot; work of housewives, and &quot;A Man&#39;s Old Queen&quot;, which focuses on the issue of elderly care...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Beijing In an Internet celebrity bookstore that mainly sells best-selling books, Southern Weekend reporters saw that the most conspicuous place at the entrance was Chizuru Ueno&#39;s &quot;Women&#39;s Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Feminism from Scratch&quot;, &quot;Misogyny&quot; and &quot;For Survival&quot;. &quot;Thoughts&quot; and other works are placed together with popular and practical books such as &quot;How to Deal with Divorce&quot; and &quot;Common Knowledge of Civil Code in Marriage and Love&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SrcR5l7rtqhN3frsIcAX3tA9Zg3p67jAex2MFCJF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SrcR5l7rtqhN3frsIcAX3tA9Zg3p67jAex2MFCJF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255379&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chizuru Ueno&#39;s teachings have great influence in Chinese academic circles and the public sphere. Lu Weiwei, a professor at Southeast University who had invited Chizuru Ueno as a visiting scholar, was influenced by her and established a gender research group at the school. The most subscribed female podcast program &quot;Random Fluctuation&quot; on the Xiaoyu App started talking about Chizuru Ueno in the first episode. The picture shows a woman reading a book in the EMI Building in Xujiahui Park, Shanghai, in April 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the focuses of the dispute between the three female bloggers mentioned above and Ueno is that the blogger who is married and has children The Lord asked Ueno, who chose not to get married and have children, &quot;Did you decide not to get married because you were hurt by men?&quot; This type of question is not uncommon in life. It is a misunderstanding that many people have about single women, so it has offended many people on the Internet. Netizens spontaneously posted in defense of Chizuru Ueno, believing that the three bloggers did not understand what feminism was and that such questions were very &quot;misogynistic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;I like communicating with people from the bottom of my heart&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On social platforms, Chizuru Ueno shows off her iconic red hair. She speaks softly and smiles, but her remarks are sharp. For example, she once strongly criticized the gender injustice in Japanese society, exposing the reality of how women are coerced by &quot;maternal love&quot; and extracting &quot;surplus value&quot;, and said: &quot;Shout when it hurts&quot; Pain, human dignity begins here.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I got to know Chizuru Ueno through Professor Toyo Suga of the University of Tokyo. Suga is a famous Japanese folklorist. He told me that Ueno plays an important role in the whole of Japan. Her influence in the field of humanities and social sciences ranks among the top five, so I must read more of her works.&quot; Lu Weiwei, a professor at the School of Foreign Languages ​​at Southeast University, told Southern Weekend reporters. As one of Ueno&#39;s earliest researchers and translators in China, Lu Weiwei was originally engaged in folklore research. In recent years, she has also taken gender studies as her main research direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Weiwei has systematically read more than 30 works by Chizuru Ueno. She concluded: &quot;Ueno and his peers established Japanese women&#39;s studies, and things that were not included in academic vision in the past began to be taken seriously. Research, she identified such an academic field.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retiring from the University of Tokyo, Chizuru Ueno has been very active, and her research has gradually shifted to issues such as elderly care and care. Lu Weiwei recalled: &quot;When I visited Teacher Ueno in Tokyo in July 2023, she also gave me three new books. She is 75 years old and is still actively working and writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Lu Weiwei planned The &quot;Todai × Todai&quot; (abbreviations for the University of Tokyo and Southeast University respectively) series of lectures invites Ueno to give lectures at Southeast University in 2019. Classes run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day, and Ueno often takes the initiative to ask for extra classes. From gender studies to aging studies, Chizuru Ueno &quot;teaches everything&quot; in almost all fields of her research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After finishing the course at Southeast University, Lu Weiwei accompanied Ueno to visit several cities such as Xi&#39;an, Harbin, Changchun and Beijing, and gave sharings at different universities. After 18 days of contact, Lu Weiwei got a deeper understanding of Ueno: &quot;She is very curious and very considerate. I praised the umbrella she brought with her for its practicality and beauty, and she gave it to me before leaving.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media person Qing Qingzi planned and published a collection of dialogues between female scholars, which included her in-depth interview with Chizuru Ueno in 2021. During the exchange, Ueno not only expressed her own opinions, but also listened carefully and listened carefully to the interview. The situation in China is of great interest. Since the video interview was very long, Chizuru Ueno even ordered a cake and said, &quot;If we meet, we can eat it together.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingqingzi felt that Ueno was a very candid scholar. Although she said that she did not want to expose her personal side, she was still very willing to expose herself when the conversation was enjoyable. After getting to know each other through interviews, Qingqingzi and Ueno maintained email communication like friends. &quot;Ueno really likes to communicate with people from the bottom of his heart.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, just a few days after Chizuru Ueno’s discussion about being single and getting married became a hot search topic on Weibo, the Japanese media “Shukan Bunshun” published an article titled “Chizuru Ueno, the founder of single education, naturalizes” The article &quot;Marriage&quot; broke the news that Chizuru Ueno and the late historian Shirkawa Daiyoshi had registered their marriage. Some people began to question Chizuru Ueno, believing that her words and deeds were inconsistent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 days later, Chizuru Ueno responded by publishing the article &quot;The 15-Hour Bride&quot; in the &quot;Woman Public Theory&quot; magazine to clarify the cause and effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seikawa is 23 years older than Ueno. His wife has passed away and his son has lost contact with her. Ueno has taken on the responsibility of taking care of Seikawa and helping him manage his assets. This relationship is exactly what Ueno wants to study about pension issues in his later years. Through practice, she hopes to establish an effective mutual-help relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, because Ueno is legally not related to Shikawa, he cannot sign the consent form for the operation at the critical moment, nor can he help him handle complex property matters.

Their marriage only lasted 15 hours before Sechuan passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t intend to hide this, but there was no reason to disclose it in the first place. Everyone who knows already knows, and my friends are not the kind to sell their friends&#39; privacy. Villain. But if there are outsiders spreading some false rumors, it would be better for me, the person involved, to tell these stories to everyone personally, so I wrote this article.&quot; At the end of the article, Chizuru Ueno wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Chizuru Ueno&#39;s new book &quot;Marry Me&quot; was published. In this book, she analyzed in detail her views on issues such as marriage and childbirth. On the cover of this new book, there is this sentence written: &quot;Towards a society where you can freely choose whether to marry, get married, or have children!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is no longer impossible to live without marriage&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can you briefly introduce the background of your writing &quot;Marry Me&quot; and what kind of opportunity it was for you to write it? Have you decided to talk specifically about the issue of being single and not getting married? I&#39;m also curious, has there been any change in Japan&#39;s unmarried group since this book was first published? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Among the female population of the same age, I belong to the less than 5% of unmarried people. Japan&#39;s lifelong non-marriage rate has continued to rise. By 2020, the non-marriage rate for men was 28.25% and for women was 18.81%. The government calls this statistic &quot;never-married.&quot; But I call it &quot;not married&quot;. Because &quot;unmarried&quot; means &quot;not yet married&quot;, implying that &quot;sooner or later you will get married.&quot; However, since there are so many people who are not married, it means that &quot;not getting married&quot; is not a stage of life, but a way of life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you get married or not, you have children, you don’t have children, you get divorced... There are more choices, which is a good thing. Rather than saying that this book had an impact on society, it is better to say that changes in society created needs that prompted the publication of this book. Because before this, those unmarried men and women have always suffered discrimination and were always asked &quot;Why don&#39;t you get married?&quot; This book aims to encourage those unmarried people to live an upright life, so I chose &quot;Not Married, Again&quot; how? &quot;(Editor&#39;s note: the original title of the Japanese version of &quot;Marry Me&quot;) is the title of the book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The marriage rate in Japan is also getting lower and lower. Do you think that behind the scenes? What is the reason? Are there different reasons why men choose not to marry and why women choose not to marry? If this continues, people&#39;s understanding of marriage will inevitably change. Do you think we have reached such a point now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Not only because marriage is no longer an attractive option, but also because I want to start a family. The cost is simply too high. That&#39;s why the number of men and women who don&#39;t get married will increase. Men and women show an asymmetry in their reasons for choosing not to marry. Men cannot get married, and women do not want to get married. In the past, marriage was a necessity of life for both men and women, and it was impossible to live without marriage. But in today&#39;s Japan, marriage is a &quot;life surplus asset&quot; that makes life richer. People&#39;s expectations for their spouses have also increased a lot compared to the past. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once said, &quot;Compared to not getting married, I I want to know more about the reasons for getting married.&quot; How do you understand women who enter into marriage? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Having sex because we are in love, having children and becoming parents out of our own will, this experience can make us Life is more abundant. However, many men and women get married and have children when they reach a certain age just for reasons such as obeying traditional customs, &quot;because of parents&#39; requirements&quot;, &quot;because of society&#39;s requirements&quot;. If they have never seen their parents have a happy married life, how can their children be motivated to get married? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If women had more choices, they would not choose to marry against their will. And if their married life is very unhappy, they can also escape from it. For this reason, men must make changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You were also exposed to marriage rumors a while ago, until you later made a statement State the cause and effect of the matter. What impact did this have on you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am still opposed to the (Japanese) marriage system. Unfortunately, the barriers to Japanese familialism laws are too thick, so I had no choice but to take advantage of the system to do something. To this day, I still deeply regret it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Marriage will not greatly change a woman’s life, but childbirth will&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When discussing marriage issues, we must also face the issue of fertility. Marriage and childbirth are no longer a must-choose issue in life, but it does not mean that women will no longer be anxious about it. What do you think of this issue? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no inevitable relationship between marriage and childbirth. However, many people get married for the purpose of having children.

In China, some cities have begun to provide policy support for unmarried mothers such as settlement. There is a sentence on the cover of the Chinese version of &quot;Marry Me&quot;: &quot;Towards a society where you can freely choose not to marry, to get married, or to have children!&quot; Is this kind of social form possible? What efforts do people need to make? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Many unmarried single mothers mostly do not actively choose not to get married, but after learning the news of pregnancy, they make themselves The pregnant man ran away. However, they did not choose to induce labor, but chose to give birth to the child. The background condition is that he has the support of his parents in his hometown. Of course, there are also some women who actively choose to become unmarried single mothers because they have certain financial strength. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand of the Japanese women&#39;s movement is to &quot;establish a society where women can give birth and raise children alone.&quot; However, society still does not provide enough support to single mothers, and even assigns &quot;three, six, or nine&quot; categories to widowed single mothers, divorced single mothers, and unmarried single mothers. Only recently has discrimination between these categories been gradually erased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people believe that policies to support single mothers will encourage men&#39;s &quot;irresponsible&quot; mentality. There is indeed a problem at this level, but the government allocating a certain amount of tax money to support single mothers means that our society has a collective responsibility in raising the next generation, and this collective also includes men who pay more taxes. Some Nordic countries will impose mandatory alimony on the man who got the woman pregnant. If the man is unwilling to pay, the state will advance the payment for him and then hold the man accountable. Japan does not have such a system, which is really a headache. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For many women who are married and have children, they have to work, You have to take on housework; but if you don’t work, you can’t gain so-called “independence.” This seems to be a dilemma of modernity? Do you think there is a solution to this dilemma? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are four ways to share women’s family responsibilities: First, the first point is that men should also assume the same family responsibilities; the second point is that the state should provide public childcare services (such as providing nurseries, etc.) to reduce the childcare burden of citizens; the third point is to use the income earned by both parties from working together to hire someone to do housework; the fourth point is, Relying on the power of (maternal) grandmothers, but this approach simply shifts the responsibility from one generation of women to another. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, none of the above four methods exist. This is exactly why Japanese women are in so much pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Human beings are fragile&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Your research not only focuses on history, but also radiates to the present, including but not limited to issues such as sexual violence in war, individual sex and love, the situation of housewives, and care for the elderly. I am very curious about the source of your awareness of these issues. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;All my research is based on my own experience. When I was young, I was interested in topics such as &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;love&quot;. As I got older, I began to care about topics such as &quot;old age&quot; and &quot;caregiving&quot;. I also met and talked to many women who were leading different lives. I have experience living in Germany. Both Japan and Germany were defeated countries in World War II, but what kind of relationships did they establish with their surrounding countries after the war? I was struck by the obvious difference between Germany and Japan on this point. To this day, Japan still has not been able to establish full trusting relations with neighboring countries such as South Korea and China, which it has invaded before. For this reason, I feel very sorry. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Whether it is women or the elderly, the support for the weak Attention is a focus of your research.

Since it is fragile, it should be treated with caution. By thinking this way, we can be tolerant of others and more tolerant of ourselves.

The long-term care insurance introduced by Japan more than 20 years ago has played a great role in allowing citizens to live with peace of mind in old age. Hopefully we can learn something from it too. For me, growing older is a new experience.

It is a pity that Japanese universities have neither “women’s studies departments” nor “women’s studies directions.” Rather than enclosing territory, it is more important to extend gender perspectives across all fields. As a result, we have accumulated theoretical and empirical research on women’s studies and gender studies in many fields, and have trained many researchers. The website &quot;WAN&quot; (https://wan.or.jp/general/corner/papers) we created has collected a list of more than 1,500 dissertations on women&#39;s studies or gender studies over more than 40 years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a concept that when it comes to feminism, It seems that it is inevitable to discuss love, marriage and family, and some of your research is also related to this, but is this what feminism is all about? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No, it’s because in human society, no group is independent of gender. So when there are women, we use women’s experience as the research object. When there are no women, we study why there are no women.

Under China&#39;s reform and opening up policy, and with the continuous development of marketization, the life experiences of women in the two countries may be getting closer and closer.

Xiao Zhang mentioned that the organizer of that performance set up zones for the audience, including &quot;quiet viewing area&quot;, &quot;free area&quot; and &quot;female area&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &quot;Free Zone&quot;, fans will support and interact enthusiastically, such as the &quot;take-off&quot; mentioned just now - lifting the audience up and &quot;flying&quot; to the stage; &quot;Quiet Viewing Zone&quot; &quot; is prepared for the introverted &quot;i people&quot; group. They don&#39;t need to do anything, and just want to enjoy the idol&#39;s performance silently in the audience. Xiao Zhang chose to stay in the &quot;female area&quot;, and this part of the audience will wave light sticks in honor of their idols. Calling, but not nearly as intense as &quot;Free Zone&quot;. The setting of partitioned viewing ensures that audiences with different personalities can be immersed in the performance and avoid mutual interference and collision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the performance, Xiao Zhang had his first photo with his idol at the following &quot;special event&quot;. &quot;Special Bonus&quot; is an event held together with the performances of underground idol groups.

The ticket prices for the performances range from tens to 200 yuan depending on the size of the event (occasionally there are free performances) , the box office revenue belongs to the show organizer. The income of idol group companies and members mainly depends on fans&#39; consumption at &quot;special events&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She told reporters that fans of &quot;Geo Doll&quot; call taking Polaroid photos with their idols &quot;Paikiri&quot; (translated from the Japanese transliteration of Polaroid), and idols will also &quot;cut&quot; Leave your own signature graffiti on (photo). The average price of a &quot;che&quot; with an idol&#39;s signature graffiti is about 80-100 yuan; the average price of a &quot;che&quot; without a signature graffiti is about 40-60 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Purchasing a &quot;special coupon&quot; will not only give you the opportunity to take a Polaroid photo with your idol, but also means that fans will have the opportunity to chat with their idol up close for about a minute, so the special coupon will be Also known as &quot;Qiaochanghui&quot; (shooting + chatting). Xiaozhang told reporters that while fans are communicating with their idols, there will be staff standing by to count the time. Many fans will buy a dozen or even dozens of special coupons at one time in order to gain more time with their idols. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why do we need “underground idols”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Emotional value, high cost performance, two-way travel&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When talking about the reasons for &quot;falling into the trap&quot;, Xiaozhang emphasized that &quot;all The importance of &quot;real singing&quot; and &quot;stage appeal&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before, she also went to watch offline performances of some &quot;above ground&quot; idol groups (contrary to &quot;underground&quot;, idol artists who will be exposed in mainstream media). In order to ensure the quality of the performance, the audience rarely gets to see the full stage of singing and dancing. &quot;In comparison, &#39;Dippo&#39; has better stage appeal, and singing on the mic is really important.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/25/db78036bddb3d20628f09a8334734652.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;393&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/10/25/db78036bddb3d20628f09a8334734652.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255296&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the stage of underground idols, Xiao Zhang can feel that these young idols are coming from their own hearts. I love singing and dancing at heart. &quot;Seeing this person working hard for his beloved dream and shining on the stage makes me feel inspired.&quot; Perhaps many people have had an &quot;idol dream&quot; in their hearts, but they were unable to realize it due to various reasons. &quot;Seeing them When you work hard, you feel good, and you feel that you have to work harder (to live a good life).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the singing and dancing levels of underground idols vary, some members have made great progress. There is no space, but in the eyes of fans such as Xiao Zhang, daring to open the microphone and sing for real is an attitude worthy of recognition, &quot;At least they work hard to show themselves on stage. And I think she (Xiao Zhang&#39;s idol) has the talent to sing.&quot; Progress can be clearly felt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with reporters, fan Xiaojie attributed the essence of chasing stars to &quot;obtaining emotional value&quot;: &quot;The purpose of chasing idols is not to say that our aesthetics have How high it is depends on how strong their singing and dancing skills are. They are just chasing an emotional value. Watching idols will make our lives more interesting and make every weekend more fulfilling. When we are so tired from work, we have to think of something to support us. Go down.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e0574545470994e52f13ffa9b3659f74.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity : 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;434&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e0574545470994e52f13ffa9b3659f74.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255297&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the conversation with reporters, the two fans unanimously mentioned that compared to those mainstream idols who are active in the public eye, chasing &quot;land idols&quot; has a higher cost-effectiveness and allows them to be in the public eye. Get more emotional value with the same effort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the &quot;above ground&quot; idol group SNH48 also uses &quot;face-to-face idols&quot; as its operating model, with theater performances and &quot;handshake meetings&quot; similar to &quot;special parties&quot;, but its prices are much higher than those of the &quot;ground&quot; idol group. I&quot;. Ticket prices, originally priced at only 98 yuan, have been skyrocketed, and tickets for popular events cost tens to hundreds of yuan. If you want a VIP position such as the first row, you need to bid, which can easily cost thousands of yuan. A handshake ticket (which allows you to shake hands and chat with a young idol for 10 seconds) costs 20 to 30 yuan, an autograph ticket costs 100 to 200 yuan, and a photo ticket costs 600 to 700 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, when &quot;Geo Puppet&quot; provides services such as photos, autographs, and face-to-face communication, fans can gain a richer emotional experience at less cost. After all, the number of fans that &quot;ground puppets&quot; have is far less than that of celebrity artists. Most of them have clear impressions of their followers. They will remember almost every fan&#39;s appearance, preferences, topics of communication and other details. There are also many more. Respond with energy and emotion to achieve a true &quot;two-way rush&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e2ed8f51cdc6b930124e9867fa606f9c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;407&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e2ed8f51cdc6b930124e9867fa606f9c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255298&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Xiaojie shared with reporters that she once received a fan benefit when she purchased a certain number of &quot;special coupons&quot; - asking her idol to write a letter to her. &quot;Because I wrote her a letter before, she wrote a reply.&quot; In that letter to her idol, Xiaojie mentioned how happy she felt every time she went to watch her idol&#39;s performance, and these contents It was also mentioned one by one by the idol in the reply letter, &quot;She told me (written in the reply letter) that actually when she received my letter, she was very unsure and confused. She said it was mine. That letter gave her a lot of strength.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the idol also expressed her persistence and love for this career and her years of pursuing her dream. &quot;She said that every time she stood on the stage Every time she went on stage, she would feel a sense of tingling excitement. She had very few fans before, and she thought about whether to continue, and was confused for a long time... But in the end she figured it out, as long as she enjoys standing on the stage It’ll be great when you get on.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaojie mentioned that compared to mainstream celebrity artists, the feeling of “Chasing the Earth Puppet” is more pure. Since underground idols are not exposed in the media, the state of being close to amateurs will be more real and relaxed. Without the constraints of the company, the packaging of personality, and the scrutiny of the public, fans can feel &quot;the intimacy like friends&quot; when communicating with idols. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Who is becoming an “underground idol”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Liu Xiajun: &quot;After becoming an underground idol, I clearly know who is supporting me.&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Have participated in &quot;Creation&quot; Liu Hajun, the singing and dancing idol of &quot;Camp 2019&quot;, experienced &quot;from the ground to the underground&quot; this year and became the captain of the men&#39;s &quot;ground puppet&quot; group &quot;Brick Paw Team&quot;, thus having the opportunity to go on stage again and have close contact with fans.

At first, he was an artist of his former company doing various interviews and filming work. Later, due to the epidemic, the company was disbanded and reorganized, and his work content became live broadcasting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But soon, he was not used to live broadcasts and realized that what he really wanted to do was sing and dance on stage, so he terminated his contract with the company and once again turned his identity into a dance troupe member and dance teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of this year, a friend of Liu Xiajun learned that a men&#39;s &quot;ground puppet&quot; group was recruiting members, and immediately recommended Liu Xiajun to sign up. &quot;He said that when he saw the registration requirements, he felt that it was tailor-made for me - &#39;good at singing and dancing, and loves the stage.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this, Liu Xiajun began to gradually understand the &quot;ground puppets&quot; &quot;This profession. &quot;The most attractive thing about this thing is that I can go on stage.&quot; After searching for information and watching offline, his love and yearning for the stage defeated all hesitations and concerns, and he finally decided to give it a try. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, Liu Xiajun has become the captain of the first men&#39;s &quot;ground puppet&quot; group in China, the &quot;Brick-moving Barking Team&quot;. The group has a total of six members, including students and 9-to-5 workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Xiajun revealed that the team&#39;s rehearsal time is usually set after nine o&#39;clock in the evening, and everyone works hard to get along with each other. &quot;As for the stage, I still demand myself according to the requirements of the past (during the Creation Camp), even better than before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 27, the &quot;Brick-Moving Wangwang Team&quot; successfully ushered in First performance. Liu Xiajun still clearly remembers that many fans who have liked him since the broadcast of &quot;Produce Camp 2019&quot; came to the scene to support him, which moved him very much: &quot;Many fans from 4 years ago still support me now. , has been with me for a long time. At that moment, I really felt that I did the right thing and did not let them down.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a former &quot;above ground idol&quot;, in the process of turning to the &quot;underground&quot; , Liu Xiajun is also slowly adapting to his new identity and constantly learning new skills, such as how to communicate closely with fans at the &quot;special party&quot; after the performance, what topics should he talk to everyone; when there are fans How to communicate with them when talking about life troubles; what patterns should be drawn when signing and graffiti on &quot;Che&quot; (photos)...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/25/120132533396b7f88e39091203bc3585.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/120132533396b7f88e39091203bc3585.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255301&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in Liu Xiajun&#39;s view, being a &quot;land puppet&quot; is more unique The advantage is that he can receive more intuitive, specific and immediate feedback from fans. The relationship between idols and fans has changed from one-way output to two-way interaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I participated in &quot;Creation Camp&quot;, I knew that some people liked me, but &#39;fans&#39; were more like a concept with a certain sense of distance. But when I was an underground idol, I was able to I know very clearly who is supporting me, her nickname, image, and even her emotions and her story. I can know why everyone likes me and what is not good about my performance today.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When asked &quot;What kind of person is suitable to be a puppet&quot;, Liu Xiajun also mentioned the word &quot;emotional value&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think to be an underground idol, you must be a very sincere person. You must love this job, respect this job, and sincerely face all the people who support you. Your singing and dancing skills can continue Growth, but attitude is the most important.&quot; He talked about his understanding of the profession of &quot;idol&quot;, &quot;The duty of an idol is to make fans happy, to bring good energy to fans, (to provide them with) &#39;emotional value&#39; &#39;For an idol, it is greater than anything else.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is the future of &quot;underground idols&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Conversation with performance operators &amp;amp; group producers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to artists with stage experience like Liu Xiajun, there are also a large number of people who love singing Amateur stage dancers have joined the &quot;ground puppet&quot; industry in recent years. However, it should be noted that as a new industry, underground idols have not yet reached a mature stage. Many relevant reports have mentioned that the income of most underground idols is not considerable, and most of them work part-time to &quot;generate money for love.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Xiajun revealed to reporters that he never regarded &quot;ground puppets&quot; as a way to make money from the beginning. &quot;In fact (now) most of his income still comes from being a dance teacher and performing in a dance troupe. Underground The job of an idol is more out of love.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Xiajun, who has a certain fan base, cannot support himself just by being a &quot;land puppet&quot;, let alone those who need to accumulate popularity from scratch. Amateur idol. Although more and more people are joining in, with the current audience size, &quot;ground puppet&quot; has not yet developed into a stable career that can make a living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Liu (pseudonym), who started hosting &quot;ground puppet&quot; performances in 2021, told reporters that he has always treated the &quot;ground puppet&quot; group as real commercial entertainers. If they are invited to participate in the platter, If they perform, their travel expenses will be reimbursed to ensure that the groups that come to perform do not lose money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We will share some of the commission for the &#39;special event&#39;, but we will ensure that you will have a certain amount of income as long as you come.&quot; Xiao Liu revealed that this method of operation is different from most situations in the industry. &quot;Other performances The organizers basically ask you to bear the performance costs yourself, but basically most people (the income from the special events) cannot afford their own travel expenses, so it is easy to lose money as a group, and it will also cause a very high income (for the puppets). Unstable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/a17d7695c9f01ab1fb67614e8a3d3049.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;636&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/a17d7695c9f01ab1fb67614e8a3d3049.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255302 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is more worrying than the meager income is the chaos in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting this year, in addition to hosting platter performances, Xiao Liu has also begun to create and operate a new &quot;ground puppet&quot; group. Talking about his original intention to join a group, Xiao Liu mentioned that he has seen some bad phenomena in the industry in recent years and hopes to do his best to improve the current situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We feel that there are many children, who may be minors or just adults, as well as freshly graduated college students. They are completely unaware of the sinister side of society and will be deceived and work for others for nothing. The share received is very small.&quot; Xiao Liu also revealed that some companies will even pocket the travel subsidies provided by the event organizers, &quot;asking the organizers to reimburse hotel expenses and actually allowing members to stay in youth hostels.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Liu It is hoped that through the production team, we can find &quot;Earth Puppet&quot; members with real potential, and at the same time, we can provide them with relatively better treatment and protect their living foundation. &quot;We will reimburse them for all travel expenses for performances, including daily rehearsals, costumes, songwriting, etc., all of which will be borne by us, and the income share we give them will be higher than the general level in the industry.&quot; Xiao Liu told reporters, At present, in addition to &quot;land puppets&quot;, he is also engaged in other businesses, and the related income also supports him to continue to be an underground idol. &quot;Because we are not making money from this (land puppets), so as long as we don&#39;t pay particularly hard, , we can do it.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an imported culture, underground idols still face the test of localization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fan Zhang mentioned in an interview that the current performances of many &quot;ground puppet&quot; groups are still mainly covering songs of Japanese underground idols. Even if they are original songs, many of them are in Japanese. . &quot;There are definitely copyright issues (for performance covers), but it may be because it is difficult for (foreign copyright holders) to come to China to trace back.&quot; Xiao Liu told reporters that his group is also preparing original songs with Chinese lyrics to enrich the performance. content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the localization of performance content, the &quot;ground puppet&quot; industry still faces many problems in its rapid development and expansion, such as the diversification of audiences. Xiao Liu mentioned in an interview that a large part of the current domestic audience for &quot;geol&quot; people have &quot;climbed over the wall&quot; from other cultural circles. Their aesthetic orientations and star-chasing habits are diverse. What should we do? Compatible coexistence? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For another example, he knows that this industry needs relevant treaties to regulate it, but he also bluntly said: &quot;It itself is an &#39;underground culture&#39;. If there is too much intervention in the &#39;above ground&#39; way, there may be no It’s the kind of freedom that everyone loves.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While many fans like Xiaozhang &quot;hope that more people can understand and accept this niche culture&quot;, many people also raise questions and concerns about promoting &quot;Earth Puppets&quot; out of the circle. , to some extent it seems to be contrary to the essence of &quot;Earth Puppet&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although everything is still being explored, we need to gradually improve it to achieve a certain balance. But what is worthy of recognition is that the &quot;underground idols&quot; that are growing freely and expanding rapidly have provided a new opportunity and possibility for the idol industry that has been in the cold at the moment when domestic entertainment talent shows are suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It allows us to see that &quot;star chasing&quot; is not only fans&#39; admiration and following of idols, and the construction and imagination of intimate relationships, but also two-way, equal, and co-creation. Clear business rules and a close interactive experience allow idols who enjoy the stage to see clearly the faces of everyone in the audience, allowing fans to receive real and concrete responses to their efforts. In the world of &quot;underground idols&quot;, &quot;going both ways&quot; is easier to cash in on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:55:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[邱礼涛：香港电影打工人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259250]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;After the movie &quot;Moscow Operation&quot; entered preparations, at the internal meeting of Chinese Film Industry, whenever the director&#39;s Ideal candidate, many people will ask, is it possible to find Director Qiu? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film is based on the &quot;China-Russia Train Robbery&quot; in 1993. It combines real historical cases in China with commercial elements. Successful precedents include &quot;Operation Mekong&quot; and &quot;Operation Red Sea&quot;. &quot;Operation Moscow&quot; has a strong pursuit of film industrialization. It took more than half a year to restore many real scenes in Russia at that time, and presented the underground cistern, the Sino-Russian train rail-changing station, and the rocket base 1:1. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Producer Gui Youming said that the production team had just watched &quot;Bomb Disposal Expert 2&quot; not long ago and liked the film very much. &quot;It seemed to be somewhat similar to what we wanted.&quot; If it were placed in the 1980s, this candidate might be John Woo or McDonald&#39;s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, (co-producer) Andy Lau helped hand over the script, and Qiu Litao made a decision quickly after reading it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since entering the Hong Kong film industry in the 1980s, Qiu Litao has served as a photographer, editor, screenwriter, and director on the set, covering almost all types of work.

To this day, it can still bring &quot;the most authentic Hong Kong films&quot; to audiences. However, in the summer of 2023, the box office results of Qiu Litao&#39;s three films were not satisfactory. &quot;Jedi&quot; cost 100 million yuan, but the box office was less than 30 million yuan, which attracted criticism from him as a &quot;bad film&quot; and &quot;a professional director&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting with Director Qiu Litao will be at the end of September 2023.

The story of Takovich and Aung San Suu Kyi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by Pumpkin Vision)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Litao told Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;Anti-Drug 2&quot; and &quot;Bomb Disposal Expert 2&quot; After the success of &quot;The Movie&quot;, the number of people looking for him to make films was actually as high as before. Even when Hong Kong&#39;s film scene was in dire straits, people were still looking for him to film. &quot;When it comes to quantity, it used to be a little less, but it&#39;s still quite a lot. Not a lot means I can&#39;t finish them all, and I still have some to recommend. But in the past few years, the ones I&#39;ve been approached to shoot are all big productions, and here&#39;s the difference.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Superman&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Gui Youming and Qiu Litao first met in Xishuangbanna. At that time, he and screenwriter Chen Daming went there with the script of &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;. Qiu Litao, who was still filming another film, had already done his homework in advance. He took a notebook and talked about his ideas one by one. The main opinion was to reduce the script . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Sino-Russian train robbery in 1993 caused a sensation. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the K3 train, which was responsible for economic exchanges between China and Russia, carried countless &quot;transnational villains&quot;, and robberies and rapes occurred frequently. Screenwriter Chen Daming has personally experienced that period of history, and remembers that all the talk in the phone booth at that time was about reselling color TVs and jeeps. In 1992, he spent six months in Moscow and saw an old man wearing a Soviet Patriotic War medal begging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Litao hopes to restore the people and style of that era. The policemen and robbers in the movie are all people who have left their hometowns. For a long time, he has wanted to film the subject of Chinese people wandering abroad. For example, the workers who came to North America and Malaysia back then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/u4MErr0xLRjh1yKi9hfAxF515WvyRbCtGwP3fesB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/u4MErr0xLRjh1yKi9hfAxF515WvyRbCtGwP3fesB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255318&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The era when the Sino-Russian train robbery occurred and the story of Chinese people living overseas attracted Qiu Litao to direct the film &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;. The picture is a still from the film. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the film producer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the filming of &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;, Gui Youming experienced the efficiency of Qiu Litao&#39;s team up close. If the start time is 8:30 in the morning, his car usually arrives at 8:15. “As soon as he gets out of the car, Jason (executive director Wen Zhenwei) runs up to him and tells him that the director has arranged this like this and that. &quot;Start the first shot at 8:30 on time, &quot;then shoot, shoot, shoot&quot;, and half an hour after lunch, &quot;continue to shoot, shoot, shoot&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the new crown epidemic is still spreading. Gui Youming remembered that Qiu Litao had never been infected with the new coronavirus and only had a cold. From July to early October, I had six days off and one day off. I basically worked 14 hours a day on the set, which was &quot;completely superhuman.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Film researcher and film critic Kai Yin is a fan of Qiu Litao. In the early summer of 2021, he visited the crew of &quot;Jedi&quot; in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan. What impressed Kaiyin deeply was that Qiu Litao did not drink alcohol. Even when producers and investors came, he only drank plain water. After dinner, he left the table and said he would be filming the next day. &quot;I can&#39;t imagine how he interacts with people... He doesn&#39;t make people feel awkward. People think he&#39;s quite amiable and are willing to invest money in making movies for him. He definitely has some of his own qualities in social interactions or how he behaves with others. A more interesting technique.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Director Qiu, I can speak on his behalf: &#39;Sorry, I don&#39;t drink when filming, okay? Of course it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like drinking, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t drink when filming. , OK?&#39;&quot; Gui Youming explained to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Director Qiu said this very sincerely, and everyone is OK.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Gui Youming&#39;s view, another director and team need Qiu Litao may only need 99 days to complete a task that takes 150 days. He has made nearly a hundred movies, &quot;horror movies, action movies, literary dramas, everything.&quot; In addition, he is a photographer, so he knows the placement of the camera and the cooperation of the team, and rarely needs to stop on the scene. Come to think of it, there are very few retakes and retakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is an opera scene with strong dramatic conflict in &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;, involving complex camera scheduling. There were more than 70 people playing a symphony on the stage, and there were more than 700 extras off the stage. The actors were walking around among them, but Qiu Litao managed every shot in just two or three takes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I asked the director if he wanted to take a few more shots. He said no, yes. It will be very good when it is edited in the future, and there will be no waste.&quot; Gui Youming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We don’t have to worry about whether the things we shoot are useful or useless. If you worry every day that the task is not completed, or too much money is spent, or the money spent does not match the output at all, then Is there any room to make things better?&quot; Gui Youming explained that this is why many investors believe that working with Qiu Litao will be much less stressful. &quot;Every penny spent will definitely be shown on the screen, no Any possibility of paying tuition fees”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the Xishuangbanna site, Kaiyin felt Qiu Litao&#39;s efficient dispatching ability. The latter often has several things running in the brain at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when I was shooting this scene, I was thinking about the special effects on the mountain over there and how to move the car in the next scene. In one scene, a gun battle scene involving police and gangsters was being filmed 30 to 40 meters in front of him. At the same time, he was experimenting with the water flow rate and water release position for another scene in which a flood rushed down from a mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever the gunfight scene ahead shouted &quot;cut&quot;, Qiu Litao in the tent would open the curtain, use a walkie-talkie to instruct the staff on the mountain to release water, test the effect, and wait until the lighting of the front camera was adjusted. , he closed the tent and filmed the next scene, racing against time. In the afternoon, the position of the water was adjusted, and the camera immediately moved over to take this shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Fight for Life&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From 1981 to 1984, Qiu Litao studied film at the School of Communication at Hong Kong Baptist University. He first studied journalism because he was influenced by &quot;All the President&#39;s Men&quot; (a classic film adapted from the autobiography of the Watergate whistleblower in Hong Kong translation) and wanted to become an investigative reporter. The following year, he was influenced by his teacher and switched to film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that era, students all yearned to intern at Radio Television Hong Kong before graduation. Because the TV program &quot;Under the Lion Rock&quot; produced by the Television Department of RTHK (directed by Maggie Cheung, Ann Hui, etc.) is the dream work of every film student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Litao also went to Radio Television Hong Kong for an interview, but was unsuccessful. He went to work as an assistant director at Asia Television arranged by the school. After one day of work, he was told not to come. Qiu Litao suffered from polio when he was a child and had difficulty moving. Later he learned that this was a &quot;kind intention&quot; from the TV station to understand him. After several teachers recommended him, he was able to continue working. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If your ability to intern for three months is doubted due to your physical condition, you will have to risk your life to enter the film industry in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the industry, Qiu Litao worked as a photography assistant, and later became the photographer of director Huang Tailai. &quot;When the Hong Kong film industry took off in the 1960s, a studio apprenticeship system was formed.&quot; Kai Yin told a Southern Weekend reporter. As shown in the documentary &quot;Dragon and Tiger Warriors&quot;, in the golden age of Hong Kong movies where action scenes dominated, a large number of martial arts practitioners came from poor backgrounds and had no chance to study. They relied on physical strength and blood and sweat to maintain the operation of &quot;Oriental Hollywood&quot;. Qiu Litao was one of the few college students in the industry at that time, but he quickly put in intense labor to prove himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was a photographer in the 1980s, Qiu Litao tried to move a lamp up a hillside. If it was 2.5K, the person asking would ask if it was enough light, and not have to change it later. If you move a 4K one, they may say that 4K is so heavy, so a 2.5K one is just fine, and you have to toss it back and forth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day he met Southern Weekend reporters, Qiu Litao walked with a huge stride. This may be a habit formed over the years. Kaiyin explained that in the film era, a 35mm film box itself weighed several kilograms. Photographers often carried more than ten kilograms while exercising, and their hands could not shake. &quot; It&#39;s hard for me to imagine how he did this... He must have worked harder than others.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongzhi, the action director of &quot;Moscow Operation&quot;, was born in a family and is a famous action director in Hong Kong. He has won the Hong Kong Film Awards and the Taiwan Film Golden Horse Award for Best Action Design many times. He and Qiu Litao met on the set in the 1980s. One is a martial artist and the other is a photography director. In his words, Qiu Litao is &quot;a person who can walk faster than a person with convenient legs and feet.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that after 2000, Qiu Litao once filmed in the Himalayas, &quot;The air in that place was very thin, and you couldn&#39;t walk fast. You would run out of air very quickly. But after shooting a scene, , I saw him running alone in the snow, and immediately after the next shot, he started walking down again.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also what the times Qiu Litao experienced shaped him. At its peak, the annual output of Hong Kong films exceeded 200. American scholar David Bordwell described in &quot;The Secret of Hong Kong Film&quot; that this city of six million people has one of the largest film kingdoms in the world, &quot;exporting The number of movies is second only to the United States.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the high-speed development period of the Hong Kong film industry from the 1980s to the first half of the 1990s, participants had a huge workload. In a recent interview, Qiu Litao said that he could go without sleep for three days, just make up for the 15 minutes between meals every day, and survive the 10 minutes after waking up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think the training Qiu Litao received in the 1980s is very important, and he knows better than others that if you want to be on the rise in such a special film environment, you can only do better. Efficiency matters. So his reputation since he started as a photographer in the late 1980s is that he is good at efficiency, and he can do it once and never twice,&quot; Kaiyin explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Limited talent&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before officially entering the industry, Qiu Litao longed for films such as &quot;Yellow Earth&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Childhood&quot;, but he quickly understood the environment in Hong Kong at that time. are not allowed. Kaiyin described that the prevailing industry atmosphere at that time was not about pursuing artistic quality and ideological expression. &quot;Commercial movies are just a commercial product.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of the 1990s, affected by multiple factors such as the Asian financial crisis, the prevalence of piracy, and the impact of Hollywood, Hong Kong movies began to decline. After filming the &quot;Yin Yang Road&quot; series, Qiu Litao went through a period of psychological depression. He explained to Southern Weekend reporters that this is like in the mainland film and television industry, if a certain type of subject matter - such as ancient costumes and time travel - cannot be started for a period of time, then these practitioners will face tension and uneasiness - he is worried that there will be no more movies. Can be photographed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the trough of the industry, Qiu Litao completed a film with authorial expression. At that time, the audience was already bored with traditional action and martial arts-themed movies. In the 1990s, as a producer, Lee Soo-hyun developed the Strange Case series of bloody third-level movies at a lower cost. In 1993, Qiu Litao&#39;s masterpiece &quot;Eight Immortals Restaurant: Human Meat Barbecued Pork Buns&quot; was released. This film, &quot;Taxi Judge&quot; and &quot;Ebola Virus&quot; were later called the &quot;Perverted Trilogy of Hong Kong Cult Films&quot;, but the third-level film The commercial type elements imply the author&#39;s concern for the bottom and marginalized people in Hong Kong society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I think this subject matter helped Qiu Litao a lot. He realized that he could do something different, because the character itself is very outstanding and the subject matter is very cold-blooded or very cruel.&quot; Kaiyin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to his proficiency in craftsmanship, Qiu Litao had already honed a set of &quot;economic aesthetics&quot; through a large number of low-cost practices. Kaiyin explained that Qiu Litao, who was born as a photographer, knew how to use camera movements and angles to make up for the cost shortcomings of scenery and costumes. &quot;Qiu Litao made everyone&#39;s brains turn. We don&#39;t have to film Jackie Chan chasing and crashing cars all over Hong Kong in order to attract the audience... You only need to give me a mental violence to replace the excitement. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Film critic Lin Zhenyu believes that since &quot;Eight Immortals Restaurant: Human Meat Barbecued Pork Buns&quot;, &quot;Qiu Litao&#39;s films on some of the more intense social issues have focused on processing and showing extremely bloody scenes and the torture of life ( His films in the early 1990s reached a state of madness and control, while his films from the late 1990s to 2000 turned cruelty into a dark satirical symbol.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kai Yin believes that the core basic point running through Qiu Litao&#39;s different films is an instinctive emotion of anger. This may come from his cultural influence from rock music and anarchist movements, but for the audience, it is a kind of relief from daily life. &quot;You may have accumulated a lot of anger or dissatisfaction in your daily life, and there is no way to vent it in a normal form. When you watch a movie, this emotion is released purposefully.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Qiu Litao received his PhD in literary studies from Lingnan University in Hong Kong. In the book &quot;Cultural Thoughts and Practices of a Film Director&quot;, Qiu Litao once explained that the idea of ​​what he called &quot;filmmaking as cultural research&quot; originated in the late 1980s. He was in Macau working on a commercial film. &quot;At that moment I was thinking: Why make a movie? Movies should have more possibilities... So, I made some movies: About an industry that is regarded as &#39;abominable&#39; &quot;Yin Yang Road 3: Raising a Coffin to Make a Fortune&quot; is a story about a funeral practitioner, &quot;Give Them a Chance&quot; about marginalized youth, and &quot;The Decameron of Sex Workers&quot; about a discriminated community.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; &quot;Bomb Disposaler 2&quot; is also an example of successfully combining commercial action films with social expression. One viewer described the film on Douban: You can tell that its creators have gone through rigorous and complete industrial training. It’s not tiring, and it’s just the right amount of fun. If you dig deeper, it will give you space to think about the relationship between man and society, justice and evil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with Southern Weekend reporters, Qiu Litao responded to many external controversies. Talking about the intensive release of four movies in one year, he said that this used to be a common thing in Hong Kong. There used to be three of his movies in the cinema on the same day, and &quot;the audience was used to it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He refutes the notion of a bad shoot and believes that it is not accurate to say that he rushed the work. He raised his head and recalled, counting next to each other - &quot;&quot;Assassination&quot; was filmed in 2018, &quot;Anti-Drug 3&quot; was filmed in 2021, &quot;Operation Moscow&quot; was filmed in 2022, and &quot;Pursuit&quot; was filmed in 2021. Filmed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You can say that I have some multitasks and do a lot of things at the same time... But we have been working on this script for &quot;Jade Chase&quot; for more than a year. If it doesn&#39;t come out well, this is ours. I can admit that my talent is limited, but the time it takes is not as short as people think, and it takes as long as other productions. I hope it can be faster, and I can shoot more if I can,&quot; Qiu Litao said. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Travelers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Qiu Litao’s story, it seems difficult to avoid his companions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of his partners are old &quot;masters&quot; in the industry. In addition to Li Zhongzhi, photography director Chen Guanghong has served as the photographer of &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; and is also Qiu Litao&#39;s partner for many years, from &quot;Yin Yang Road&quot; and &quot; &quot;The Heroic Heroine Qiu Jin&quot;...we worked all the way to &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;. He was over 70 years old, &quot;running around the scene like a young man.&quot; Gui Youming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kaiyin described Qiu Litao&#39;s team as having an unusual tacit understanding, and it was even difficult to know how they communicated with each other. Because they rarely speak, they understand each other&#39;s needs. After many years of cooperation, Li Zhongzhi knew that what Qiu Litao needed was real texture. In &quot;Operation Moscow&quot;, there was a scene where a person fell out of a train. It was not in the original script. Qiu Litao asked if it would be added to the whole set of action design. No effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The first thing you’ll see when you fall out is that it’ll look good, and the second thing will be more shocking and a bit exciting to the audience.” Li Zhongzhi understood what Qiu Litao meant, so he walked around in the train and considered what kind of action would be more reasonable. . &quot;The glass is so small, and it has to be thrown out reasonably. The last thing I want to do is hit the door in the train compartment, the door smashes the glass, and the person is pushed out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/yoUie951kErBJFzaNXG2Th8X9sAhQvMpUAQLa5d9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/yoUie951kErBJFzaNXG2Th8X9sAhQvMpUAQLa5d9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255317&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Movies The train fight scene at the beginning of &quot;Operation Moscow&quot; incorporated Qiu Litao&#39;s on-the-spot creativity. The picture is a still from the film. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the film producer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongzhi is director Chen Musheng&#39;s golden partner. He believes that the two directors are very similar and both can be &quot;People who don&#39;t sleep when filming&quot;. The difference is that director Chen Musheng will &quot;squeeze people to the bone&quot;, while Qiu Litao&#39;s method is gentler. On the set, Gui Youming found that even though they were very familiar with each other, Andy Lau and Qiu Litao always communicated in low voices, discussed and discussed, and were &quot;very professional.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, Li Zhongzhi&#39;s martial arts actors are almost all from the mainland. There are few martial arts actors in Hong Kong now, and &quot;slowly they are all broken up.&quot; When he was filming, he would sometimes be pregnant for ten months. During the COVID-19 epidemic, executive director Wen Zhenwei has been helping Qiu Litao handle work in the Mainland for a long time. Over time, a senior on the team said that he has seen him more than his wife in the past two years. &quot;Slowly, we have become like a big family.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the cold winter of the industry, some people will inherit their past majors and also draw warmth from the community. Qiu Litao once said: &quot;If you have a team, you must ensure that there is always work. Without frequent work, it is difficult to form your own team. So sometimes in order to maintain the team, I will take over the work as long as it does not violate the principles.&quot; &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, Kaiyin believes that Qiu Litao may have made mediocre films, but he does not think they are bad films - because his attitude is serious and he does not deliberately fool the filmmakers or the audience. &quot;It is precisely because of directors like Qiu Litao who are constantly making films and incorporating new people into the industry that they can gradually be trained into talents and maintain the basic operation of the Hong Kong film industry.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Wen Zhenwei graduated from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2014. He started from basic field management and gradually became Qiu Litao&#39;s executive director. During work, Qiu Litao repeatedly emphasized to his younger generations, &quot;Don&#39;t learn those fancy things first.&quot; &quot;For example, to be an assistant director, you need to know how to read and dismantle the script. You need to understand why many things are arranged this way and that way. First, you need to understand this aspect. Practice your kung fu well.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Litao grew up in the film age. He will tell his younger generations that one of the legacies of the film age is not to shoot randomly, because money is money as soon as you turn on the camera. &quot;Director Qiu often tells us a concept, that is, we should not think that we can be casual now that we have enough budget. We still have to remain precise and spend money wisely.&quot; Wen Zhenwei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I’m lucky to have made a lot of films, but if you ask representative (directors), I’m convinced that there are some, but I don’t think I’m one yet. At least for most movie fans, I Definitely not the best director in Hong Kong.&quot; He admitted to Southern Weekend reporters that his desire to make good films in recent years has been much greater than before. In the past, I was afraid that I would not be able to make a film, and that others would think that the industry was in decline; but if the film did not do well at the box office and was scolded by the audience, as a director, it is not that I have no feelings, but I will not jump off the building due to depression. But now he feels that movies live longer than people, &quot;Don&#39;t leave bad things in the world.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Litao’s answer to why he has always maintained such a strong motivation to make films is that he is fulfilled on the set and feels &quot;alive&quot;. He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that when he first entered the industry in the 1980s, his mother was always worried that he would have a hard time working outside because of his health. &quot;But she didn&#39;t know that there were many people taking care of me on the set.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;David Bordwell believes that Hong Kong films have created the most vibrant and imaginative popular films in the world since the 1970s. When a Southern Weekend reporter asked, what kind of good movie do you most want to make? Qiu Litao answered in four words—appreciation for both refined and popular tastes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[知名潜水员韩颋遗体已被打捞上岸]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259302]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 20:27:32&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;About Jiudun Skylight, Daxing Town, Du&#39;an Yao Autonomous County&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;One person&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Report on the search and rescue situation of lost contact during diving&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han, a well-known person in the diving industry After Ting lost contact while diving in Jiudun Skylight, Daxing, Du&#39;an on the evening of October 7, Du&#39;an immediately organized relevant departments and domestic professional search and rescue teams to participate in the search and rescue.

According to the &quot;2022 National Education Development Statistical Bulletin&quot;, 82,300 doctoral students will graduate in 2022, and 556,100 doctoral students will be studying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is the 40th anniversary of the graduation of the first batch of doctoral students in New China. The birth of the first batch of Ph.D.s witnessed the development of China’s degree system from scratch. Nowadays, facing the huge group of doctoral students, further improving the quality of training has become a new development focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Gang, a professor at the School of Education of Central China Normal University, believes that doctoral education should not only expand quantity, but &quot;quality must be the lifeline of doctoral training.&quot; In his view, China has spent 40 years going through the path of exploration that other countries have taken for hundreds of years, and has formed a doctoral education system that is in line with China’s reality and is still gradually improving. “The 40-year development history of doctoral education is also a doctoral education system. A History of Educational Reform.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Twisted Exploration&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The establishment of China’s doctoral system has been full of twists and turns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, although there was a degree system covering bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s and doctoral degrees, no doctorate was awarded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Gang explained that although the system had been established, the country was poor and weak at that time, and the number of undergraduate and master&#39;s students was limited, which &quot;was not enough to support the development of doctoral education.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 1956, the seventh year after the founding of New China, the &quot;Degree Regulations of the People&#39;s Republic of China (Draft)&quot; were submitted to the central government for approval, dividing degrees into master&#39;s and doctoral levels. However, due to various reasons, the regulations were not formally promulgated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the exploration of the associate doctorate system is also underway. In 1955, the Chinese Academy of Sciences officially proposed to learn from the Soviet Union and establish an associate doctorate system, and announced the first batch of 65 admissions the following year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Soviet Union, an associate doctorate was second only to a doctorate, and was also called a &quot;candidate doctor.&quot; A doctorate was not obtained through postgraduate education, but was applied for after accumulating many years of work experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the &quot;First Five-Year Plan&quot; had been implemented, which clearly proposed the establishment of a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. Zheng Gang told Southern Weekend reporters that there is an urgent need for high-level talents in both industry and higher education. Under the background of learning from the Soviet Union, associate doctoral students came into being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this exploration also failed to continue. Soon after, the former Ministry of Higher Education issued a notice, &quot;It was decided not to use the name &#39;associate doctoral students&#39;. All associate doctoral students recruited last year (1956) will be called graduate students.&quot; More than a month later, it was decided not to award an associate doctorate. Zheng Gang learned that &quot;the vast majority of associate doctoral students who had enrolled at that time only received graduation certificates and no degree certificates.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this are not only the influence of international politics, but also the difficulty of connecting the associate doctorate system with the mainstream international degree system. In addition, some universities recruit associate doctoral candidates who are not part-time workers, causing many university teachers and hospital doctors to have their work affected in order to obtain a degree. Ai Zhisheng, then deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Tsinghua University, once described him as &quot;ignoring what is going on outside the window and focusing on getting a doctorate degree.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, the establishment of China’s degree system ushered in another opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 12, 1961, Nie Rongzhen, then Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Science and Technology Commission, proposed to the central government “suggestions on establishing a system for degrees, academic titles, engineering and technical titles, etc.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He elaborated on four reasons in his suggestions, including urging intellectuals to march towards the peak of science and culture, encouraging and promoting the rapid growth of a large number of young intellectuals, and accelerating the formation of China&#39;s strong scientific and cultural team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also believes that the implementation of the degree system is also an effective way to directly promote the development of science and technology, &quot;Because in order to give degrees, it is necessary to make academic evaluations of the research work of relevant scientific and technical personnel. Through this Academic evaluation can promote academic prosperity and improve the level of science and technology in our country.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eleven days later, in his speech on &quot;Promoting a Large Number of Young Technical Cadres&quot;, Deng Xiaoping proposed, &quot;It seems that we can&#39;t do it without a degree. You can make a plan first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Benxia, ​​former director of the Office of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, once wrote an article recalling that at the end of 1963, the Ministry of Education received a call from the responsible comrade of the Science and Technology Cadres Bureau of the State Council. Deng Xiaoping had reviewed and approved the &quot;Degree Regulations (Draft)&quot; and reported Other leading comrades of the Central Committee circulated it and &quot;everyone felt very excited.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The excitement did not last long. Due to various reasons, the draft failed to enter the national legislative process and was once again shelved. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to determine the award criteria? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1978, postgraduate enrollment resumed. Although the degree system has not yet been established, some schools have begun to train doctoral students with good foundation before admission and outstanding achievements after admission according to the requirements of doctoral students. Zheng Gang told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The practice of doctoral training is earlier than the system, which reflects society&#39;s eager need for doctors.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What kind of students are taking the lead in pursuing doctoral degrees? Among the first batch of 18 doctoral degree recipients, 7 are from the University of Science and Technology of China. The article &quot;Some Experiences of the First Batch of Doctoral Training in Our School&quot; published by the Graduate School of the school in &quot;Degrees and Graduate Education&quot; provides more details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the seven graduate students at the University of Science and Technology of China as an example. Their average age is 34 years old, they have family burdens, some have not completed formal university courses, and their studies were useless after graduation, but their basic qualities are very good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The University of Science and Technology of China realized that the seven graduate students were not admitted according to degree standards. &quot;Are they supporting and encouraging them to become doctoral students, or are they all indiscriminately restricted to the master&#39;s degree? This is a test of our Can we adhere to the principle of starting from reality?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While exploring doctoral training, the establishment of a degree system has once again been put on the agenda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 24, 1979, Hu Qiaomu reported to Deng Xiaoping on the issue of establishing a degree system, &quot;It would be a great good thing if the decision can be announced soon.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Benxia participated in the drafting work. He wrote that the drafting team collected archival materials from the previous two Degree Regulations (Draft) and investigated the development of foreign degree systems since the mid-1960s. A symposium was held to conduct on-site research on the current situation of higher education, and it took nearly 7 months to complete the first draft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 1, 1980, the State Council submitted the &quot;Degree Regulations (Draft)&quot; to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress for review. Wu Benxia attended the meeting as a non-voting delegate. &quot;Everyone unanimously raised their hands and applauded warmly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Degree Regulations&quot; are scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 1981. This is the first law in the field of education in New China, clarifying that degrees are divided into three levels: bachelor&#39;s degree, master&#39;s degree, and doctoral degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, the State Council approved the first batch of 151 doctoral degree-granting units, 812 disciplines and majors, and 1,155 instructors. Among the disciplines and majors, there are 265 engineering, 233 science, and 153 medicine. Shen Wenqin, deputy director of the China Doctoral Education Research Center at Peking University, told Southern Weekend reporters that the first batch of disciplines and majors are concentrated in basic fields and are urgently needed by the country. &quot;The selection of doctoral supervisors is also very strict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After becoming the first batch of doctoral degree-granting units, the University of Science and Technology of China wants to take another step forward and award doctoral degrees to graduate students recruited in 1978 who have reached the academic level of a doctoral degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 5, 1982, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council responded to the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, agreeing to provide doctoral degree course education and thesis defense for individual graduate students with higher academic levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, 8 units including the University of Science and Technology of China, Fudan University, and East China Normal University were approved for pilot testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the real problem for these schools is how to judge the criteria for awarding a doctorate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to make the opinions more representative, the University of Science and Technology of China hires up to 9 experts at a time when reviewing graduation thesis. When reviewing Li Shangzhi&#39;s paper, the opinions of experts were not unanimous. Three people believed that it had reached a doctoral level, and another one believed that it had reached a &quot;master&#39;s degree or above.&quot; Li Shangzhi then wrote two more papers, which finally passed the review smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/jJQqzvhOzZtwDScsCXl9N0nfnrzijZCdTBzvPhhZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;643&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/jJQqzvhOzZtwDScsCXl9N0nfnrzijZCdTBzvPhhZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255344&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Among the first batch of 18 Ph.D.s in New China, 7 are from the University of Science and Technology of China. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Who will train doctors? &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Who trained the first batch of PhDs? Since the establishment of the degree system in 1981, a method has been formulated and implemented for the unified review of doctoral supervisors (hereinafter referred to as &quot;doctoral supervisors&quot;) by a national organization. After five batches of reviews, 8,043 doctoral supervisors were approved nationwide, and by the end of 1993, a total of more than 14,000 doctoral supervisors had been trained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a doctoral supervisor qualification review process was once helpful in ensuring the quality of doctoral training, but it has gradually exposed problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zhanjun, former deputy director of the Degree and Graduate Education Development Center of the Ministry of Education, once analyzed that with the increase in doctoral authorization units and doctoral authorization points, the scale of doctoral student enrollment has gradually expanded, and the doctoral supervisor review cycle is long, the procedures are cumbersome, and the positions are Shortcomings such as alienation are increasingly mismatched with the development situation of higher education, and &quot;the enthusiasm of higher education institutions cannot be fully mobilized.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The corresponding change is that in the 1990s, several batches of Ph.D.s mainly stayed in universities after graduation. Shen Wenqin told Southern Weekend reporters that they were already equipped to take over the academic field. Developing the capabilities of the next generation of Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Underlying the discussion on the qualification review of doctoral supervisors is the issue of &quot;unity over control&quot; of universities, which is directly related to the autonomy of universities in running schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 1993, the &quot;Opinions on Further Reforming the Examination Methods for Degree Authorization&quot; reviewed and approved by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council stated that doctoral supervisors should be determined by the degree-granting units themselves in accordance with the basic standards and conditions established by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, the power to approve doctoral supervisors will be delegated to all doctoral granting units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To solve the problem of who should train doctors, we must also solve the problem of positioning of doctorate training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A typical case is that because the medical doctors trained in China focus on experiments and scientific research training, there is a phenomenon that graduated clinical medical doctors are not qualified for clinical medical work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Gang said that society has diverse needs for talents. In addition to people who specialize in academic research, there is also a need for people to solve practical problems raised by society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1997, doctoral education ushered in another important change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April of this year, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council reviewed and approved the &quot;Several Opinions on Adjusting the Type of Medical Schools and Establishing Medical Professional Degrees&quot;, establishing a professional doctorate in clinical medicine for the first time, requiring a focus on engaging in a specific occupation. Practical work ability, with the goal of cultivating applied talents for senior clinicians, stomatologists, health and epidemic prevention, and new drug research and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above opinions point out that this &quot;is conducive to the targeted training of various specialized talents with different natures and different professional backgrounds, and is conducive to the society&#39;s selection and use of various types of specialized talents.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Fengliang, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Tsinghua University, told Southern Weekend reporters that the landmark significance of this move is that &quot;doctoral education is developing in a diversified direction.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, China has established six professional doctorate types: engineering, stomatology, education, veterinary medicine, clinical medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, as of 2019, China has awarded a total of 48,000 doctoral professional degrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There is a long way to go”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a doctor at the highest level of academic education, he must be able to deal with the practical problems that the country needs to solve most. “If a doctor can’t solve it, Who else can solve it?&quot; In Zheng Gang&#39;s view, the baton has been passed to the new generation of doctors. &quot;The burdens on them are no lighter than those of their predecessors, or even heavier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the number of doctors continues to increase, Against the background of growth, in 2007, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, the Ministry of Education, and the former Ministry of Personnel jointly launched a systematic investigation of doctoral training. As of that year, a total of 240,000 people in China had been awarded doctorates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After going deep into 289 doctoral training units across the country, 69,133 questionnaires were collected, and after interviewing more than 400 people, the investigation team recommended that the development scale of academic doctoral education be controlled and that academic doctoral education should shift from focusing on scale to Shifts that focus on quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this survey, new policies that focused on quality had already appeared in practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 1999, the then Minister of Education Chen Zhili proposed that not only outstanding doctoral theses should be selected, but also other theses should be randomly checked to ensure that the overall quality of Chinese doctoral degrees continues to improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2000, the Department of Degree Management and Graduate Education of the Ministry of Education has been responsible for conducting random inspections of doctoral theses. The evaluation content includes the innovativeness of the paper, the theoretical basis and expertise embodied in the paper, and scientific research capabilities. Since then, the number of random inspections has been increased. In order to achieve &quot;zero interference&quot; with the inspected units, degree-granting units are no longer required to submit thesis materials, but will be retrieved directly from the National Library after extraction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, it is stipulated that degree authorization sites with a high proportion of &quot;problematic theses&quot; or a large number of papers will be ordered to make rectifications within a time limit. If the requirements are still not met after rectification, the degree authorization will be revoked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council issued the &quot;Some Opinions on Carrying out Periodic Evaluation of Doctoral and Master&#39;s Degree Authorization Points&quot; and decided that starting from that year, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council would conduct regular evaluations of doctoral and master&#39;s degree authorization points every six years. Regular evaluation, the main content of the evaluation includes &quot;talent training situation, especially the quality of talent training.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Improving the quality of doctoral training is also reflected in the selection of students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, examinations were an important way to select doctors. Shen Wenqin told a reporter from Southern Weekend that candidates with scientific research talents or abilities are not necessarily good at taking exams. If standardized tests are used to screen talents at the doctoral level, &quot;the effect is not so ideal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, the General Office of the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Notice on Recruiting Doctoral Graduate Students in 2017&quot;, proposing to promote and improve the &quot;application-assessment&quot; enrollment and selection mechanism, and strengthen the professional quality and academic level. , comprehensive evaluation of scientific research capabilities, innovation potential and overall quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;application-assessment&quot; system means that candidates no longer take the entrance examination uniformly organized by the school, but review materials such as academic transcripts, proposed scientific research ideas, and original research results. Afterwards, each department will assess the application through written examinations, experiments, interviews, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same year, many universities such as Nankai University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications implemented this system. Starting from the 2023 academic year, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences will fully implement the “application-assessment” system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on the 40 years of doctoral education in China, from scratch to excellence, &quot;doctoral education has a long way to go&quot; and there are different problems and challenges at each stage. Zheng Gang said that these 40 years of exploration It proves that only &quot;reform can solve problems in the development process.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;Reference books:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;&quot;History of Graduate Education and Degree System of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;&quot;40 Years of Implementation of China&#39;s Degree System&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[轻松筹回应“女童被咬”善款：未使用的所有善款全额原路退回]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259300]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 19:24:59&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 25, @easilychouweibo issued refund instructions stating that on October 23, the injured girl After being transferred out of the ICU, the situation is relatively stable.
