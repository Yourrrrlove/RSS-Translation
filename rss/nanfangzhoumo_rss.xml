Bullying and even injuries to the private parts have attracted great attention on the Internet. The local report stated that an investigation confirmed that a female student was involved in a brief brawl, but no intentional harm was found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 28, a parent from Loudi, Hunan Province posted on social media, saying that his 7-year-old daughter was studying in the second grade of a primary school in a township in Loudi, Hunan Province. During lunch break on October 20, she was raped by 16 or 17 girls in her class. The classmates bullied her on the playground. These female classmates not only beat her daughter, but also sexually bullied her, causing injuries to her lower body and causing unbearable pain. Both the school and the parents of the bullying students have a negative attitude toward solving the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Little girls in the second grade collectively bullied their female classmates, especially sexual bullying, which was appalling. People can&#39;t help but think of the sexual bullying incident of a 9-year-old primary school student in a bilingual school in Datong, Shanxi that came to light a few months ago. Therefore, the incident quickly became a hot spot on the Internet and attracted great attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, Lengshuijiang City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Loudi City), where the incident occurred, issued a situation statement in the name of a joint investigation team, saying that after discovering the relevant video, it immediately established a joint investigation team led by the Municipal Education Bureau , the Public Security Bureau and other departments. After preliminary investigation by the public security department, it was found that the girl involved Zhang and six other female classmates were classmates in the second grade of a primary school in the city; at noon on October 20, because of an incident while skipping rope on the playground There was a dispute and &quot;mutual fighting&quot; occurred for about 1 minute, during which Zhang was &quot;briefly surrounded and slapped&quot; by several other classmates; after monitoring and monitoring was obtained, the girl involved was questioned &quot;protectively&quot;, and the witnessing teachers and students were investigated, but no evidence was found. Intentional injury. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The characterization of the incident in this official report is completely different from the accusation made by the victim’s mother. The description of the incident process is also vague and unclear, and there is no clarification on the key issues of the accusation. If the official has sufficient evidence that the girl&#39;s parents are exaggerating, they should publicly refute the evidence. Otherwise, not only will it fail to eliminate public doubts, but it will arouse greater doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first question is whether the girl Zhang’s lower body was injured. According to information released by Zhang&#39;s mother, Zhang had multiple soft tissue injuries on his body and his lower body was also injured. He was in unbearable pain when urinating and was forced to hold in his urine. However, although the official report confirmed that &quot;mutual fighting&quot; occurred, it did not mention whether Zhang was injured. This is also the aspect that attracts the most attention from netizens and makes people the most angry. Officials should not shy away from this, they should investigate this and make the results public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Zhang’s lower body is indeed injured, then this is a very serious violation of minors. The cause of the injury must be found out. If it involves criminal behavior, he must be severely punished. If Zhang was not injured, then enough credible evidence must be produced to refute the accusations made by the girl’s parents. For example, Zhang can be taken to a tertiary hospital outside Loudi City for examination accompanied by his parents, and the examination results can be announced. If Zhang’s mother exaggerates or lies, she should not avoid it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, it is necessary to release the relevant video of the incident that occurred on the playground to set the record straight. Zhang’s mother said that Zhang was beaten by 16 or 17 girls in his class on the playground. The official statement stated that except for Zhang, only six students were involved in the incident, and that several girls were &quot;fighting with each other&quot; for only about a minute, while Zhang was only &quot;briefly surrounded&quot; and &quot;swatted&quot; by several classmates. According to the two sides, not only the number of participants is hugely different, but there is also a huge difference in nature between &quot;beating&quot; and &quot;fighting with each other.&quot; Since the official statement mentioned that the police obtained the school&#39;s surveillance video, it means that the incident was recorded, and it was not the &quot;aging surveillance&quot; mentioned by the school in Zhang&#39;s mother&#39;s post. Since there is a video, it should be made public in its entirety so that the public can judge for themselves whether it was a &quot;beating&quot; or a &quot;fighting&quot;, how long it lasted, and whether there was any &quot;intentional harm.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, for the sake of protecting minors, minors who can be identified in the video can be treated with protective techniques, such as mosaic, blurred faces, etc., but it should be ensured that several minors can be seen. The individual&#39;s involvement in the incident, and the extent of the &quot;ruffling&quot; involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems a bit incredible that a 7-year-old girl would bully her classmates and also be sexually involved. But it&#39;s not impossible. In a bullying incident at a bilingual school in Datong, Shanxi, the bully was only 9 years old. This was not the first time that bullying had occurred, it had also started in the second grade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a stereotype that bullies in school are boys. In fact, this is not the case. Among school violence incidents, the proportion of women committing violence is not low. In March 2023, a bullying incident broke out in Hainan in which a 13-year-old girl was beaten and humiliated by a group of same-sex peers. When the Datong incident attracted great attention, criminal law teacher Cai also received news that a female classmate was bullied by other female classmates in the dormitory, and also engaged in sexual behavior, and the perpetrator even took a video. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, CCTV reported on a study and found that more than 80% of the perpetrators of school bullying videos posted on the Internet were women. Of course, this may be related to the fact that female bullies are more likely to take videos and upload them online to humiliate their victims, but it also shows that female perpetrators of school violence are by no means uncommon. Moreover, among the campus bullying committed by women, many of them are a group of people bullying one person, and the targets of their bullying are mostly women. Also, among the bullying committed by women, a high proportion involves sexual humiliation, such as being forced to strip naked and take photos. This may be because it creates a stronger sense of shame for the victim. These characteristics of female bullying are consistent with the accusations made by the mother of the victim in the Loudi incident that more than a dozen girls beat and sexually bullied her daughter. This is one of the reasons why netizens are more willing to believe victims’ accusations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This matter has attracted great attention on the Internet, and the official understatement of the situation is obviously difficult to convince the public. This reminds people of the sexual bullying incident at a bilingual school in Datong, Shanxi. The school and the authorities tried to turn the incident into a minor matter, but in the end, the bullying incident was confirmed. The same is true for this suspected bullying incident in Loudi. If the authorities have sufficient evidence to support their account of the situation, they should make it public promptly to refute the accusations made by the girl&#39;s parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[舒徐礼乐自圆融：礼学宗师沈文倬先生小记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259627]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 20:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/30/E4iGWSPPxsQh8e00gO9ijH5s3ebTpOzxQVWlMy0o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;610&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/E4iGWSPPxsQh8e00gO9ijH5s3ebTp OzxQVWlMy0o. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256139&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shen Wenzhuo (1917-2009), a contemporary master of rituals and a famous Confucian scholar, dedicated his life to Studying the study of the three rites, he has made outstanding achievements in many fields such as etiquette, history of Confucian classics, philology, inscriptions on oracle bones, bibliography, and compilation of ancient books. In particular, the study of the &quot;three rites&quot; has solved many problems in the history of etiquette and Confucian classics. Many unresolved problems were highly praised by Gu Jiegang. The picture was taken in May 1986. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shen Wenzhuo (1917-2009) was an &quot;invisible man&quot; at Hangzhou University. In October 1978, I entered the Chinese Department as an undergraduate student. He once gave us a few lectures on &quot;Common Knowledge of Ancient Culture&quot; in the &quot;Ancient Chinese&quot; class, but no one had much impression of him. When I was in graduate school, he was a member of the mentor group, and I started to get to know him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The headquarters of Hangzhou University (today’s Xixi Campus of Zhejiang University) in the early 1980s was small in area. Tall plane trees stretched out towards the boulevard, forming domes, showing the history of this campus. years. In the southeast corner are several rows of four-story buildings made of blue-grey bricks. The teachers&#39; dormitory and the graduate student dormitory face each other. Between the two floors is the boiler room, where the fire roars in the morning and we go there every day to turn on the water. In autumn and winter, the sycamore leaves have faded to gray, and the walkways of the boiler room are covered with finely crushed coal ash. Against the blue-grey brick walls, the vision is gray. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Mr. Shen lived in a room on the first floor of the first unit of Building No. 1, about fifteen or six square meters, opposite the public toilet. It was humid in spring, sultry in summer, and cold in winter. . There was no kitchen, so he could only light a fire in the corridor, so for more than 20 years, he had been eating in the canteen, occasionally cooking hoof bones and the like to improve his life. It wasn&#39;t until 1986 that he was assigned a two-bedroom house and moved out of here (in July of that year, he was approved as a doctoral supervisor by the State Council&#39;s Discipline Review Group). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have never entered his residence, but every time I pass by, I will stop for a moment. Later, I visited his door many times in my dreams. Through the glass above the door, I seemed to see the banners on the wall, but I couldn&#39;t always see clearly what was inside. It was like his personality and education were very mysterious and hard to see clearly. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I often meet him on the way to the cafeteria. He was over sixty years old at that time, with a broad forehead, sparse hair, and a gray beard, but his face was very rosy. He is not tall, but very strong. In winter, he put on an old gray smock over his old cotton-padded jacket, and carried a shallow bamboo basket in his left hand, which also looked like a dustpan. His big hands had thick knuckles. He always had a smile on his face and seemed to be moving as he walked on the road, making a slight &quot;huffing&quot; sound in his mouth. If he encounters the gaze of others, he responds with a smile in his eyes, his mouth seems to be moving, but he does not speak. He looked gentle and calm, yet as deep as the ocean. He beams with energy when he smiles, inspiring passers-by. So I think he was in a good mood at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What we &quot;new&quot; graduate students often talked about at that time was our own supervisors and each other&#39;s supervisors: which field we mainly worked in, what books we published, where we published papers, and what we heard about them. What are the requirements for students, what are the mantras, what new things were said in class...proudly introduce the findings of the instructor, share with each other, and listen carefully to other people&#39;s additions and discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Roommate Chen Shenyong is the first graduate student led by Mr. Shen Wenzhuo. My understanding of Mr. Shen gradually enriched through classmate Sheng Yong’s admiring explanations and everyone’s discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kTlWhOwgCv9rDWA37zbDLtgi7iIhLLAXRfIVGRBC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;999&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kTlWhOwgCv9rDWA37zbDLtgi7iIhLLAXRfIVGRBC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256136&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From left: Fang Jianxin, Mr. Shen, Li Jiemin, Wang Yunlu (photographed in 1997). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shen Wenzhuo, whose courtesy name is Fengsheng and nickname is Yinan, is from Wujiang, Jiangsu. He entered a private school when he was young, and studied by himself when he was older, without obtaining any diploma. In his early years, he studied ancient Chinese poetry from Shen Chang, and studied literature and history from Jin Tianhe and Yao Tingjie. In the early 1940s, he specialized in the study of &quot;Three Rites&quot; from Cao Yuanbi and became his close disciple, teaching and mentoring him for nine years. Cao Yuanbi (1867-1954), known as the last outstanding Confucian scholar of the Qing Dynasty, was already in his seventies, so he placed high hopes on Shen Wenzhuo: &quot;If you observe well, you can expect success.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1946, he published He wrote articles such as &quot;Shuo Gao Le&quot; and &quot;Wax&quot; and &quot;Wax&quot;, which attracted Gu Jiegang&#39;s attention, and he was hired as the deputy editor and reviewer of the National Translation and Translation Center. He was mainly responsible for proofreading classics, compiling summaries, and drafting classics dictionaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1950, he was sent to study at the Political College of North China People&#39;s Revolutionary University in Beijing. In June of the following year, he was assigned to Shanghai Library as deputy director of the Cataloging Department. The &quot;Zhongshu Zonglu&quot; we often consult, which is three very thick volumes and is more than a foot high when stacked, was compiled under his leadership. In 1960, the editorial team of &quot;Zonglu&quot; was rated as an advanced collective in Shanghai. As the team leader, he attended the Shanghai Heroes Meeting as a representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 1963, at the invitation of Professor Jiang Liangfu, he was transferred to the Language and Literature Research Office of the Zhejiang Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (located at Hangzhou University, with Xia Chengtao as the director) as a full-time researcher and went to Hangzhou alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March, as soon as I arrived in Hangzhou, I went to pay a visit to Mr. Ma Yifu; in late April, I went again. &quot;From now on, we will learn to pay homage to our predecessors and scholars, and when we meet each other, we should treat relatives with respect and be harmonious.&quot; I had some enlightenment and thought, and wrote &quot;Jiangzhuang Wen Xue Ji&quot; to record it. After autumn, he went to the Northeastern Institute of Literature and History in Changchun to teach &quot;Etiquette&quot; and returned to Hangzhou in the winter. I wanted to visit again, but I couldn&#39;t. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following year, &quot;the trend of talking about ancient studies came to an abrupt end, and the interest was greatly reduced.&quot; Soon, I went to the countryside to participate in the &quot;Social Education Movement&quot; and stayed in a commune in my hometown of Zhuji County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, he had published many papers in &quot;Archaeology&quot; (1961, 1963). It is said that Mr. Guo Moruo, then president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke highly of him after seeing him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; occurred, the research office was disbanded, and he transferred to the Chinese Department of Hangzhou University and worked as a document clerk in the department&#39;s reference room. Because of his extensive knowledge and strong memorization, his colleagues were shocked to call him a &quot;walking dictionary&quot;. He lived alone in silence, but never stopped studying etiquette. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1974, he was arranged to go to Anji to participate in the &quot;Agricultural and Forestry Class&quot; of the last &quot;May 7th&quot; Cadre School of Hangzhou University. He worked as a &quot;Duck Commander&quot; during the day and explored the secrets of etiquette at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1975, four types of works, including the &quot;Review of the Han Bamboo Bamboo Bamboo Slips Unearthed in Wuwei&quot;, were sent to Mr. Gu Jiegang for review. Gu Fuxin said that &quot;Taituan is actually the first person in the contemporary world to organize the Book of Rites&quot;, but at the same time he lamented that he didn&#39;t know when these results would be available. The above words were only circulated within a small circle at that time and were not known to the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/jHofSRDsIAXS1YQGGmUlO06aJt08qBm9Z1fpUvxx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;854&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/jHofSRDsIAXS1YQGGmUlO06aJt08qBm9Z1fpUvxx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256137&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gu Jiegang replied to Shen Wenzhuo&#39;s letter. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the end of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, the situation had changed again. In 1979, he transferred to teaching position. The following year, he was rated as an associate researcher at the age of 64. Our 1982 graduate student is his first enrollment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Hangzhou University highly regarded the &quot;Literature and History&quot; of Zhonghua Book Company and the &quot;Chinese Literature and History Series&quot; of Shanghai Ancient Books as the top journals in the field of ancient literature and history, and Mr. Shen was a frequent reader. Among them, &quot;A Brief Discussion on the Practice of Rituals and the Writing of Books on Rituals&quot; (Wenshi, Series 15 and 16, 1983) states that &quot;the practice of rituals existed earlier than written records&quot;, thus clarifying the relationship between rituals and ritual books. Mr. Yang Xiangkui later called this article &quot;a monumental work with unprecedented achievements.&quot; Another example is the article &quot;The Enrollment of the Twelve Doctors of Huanglong and the Establishment of the Taixue Prefecture and State School&quot; (1983), which analyzes the complex historical facts of the establishment of the Doctor of Confucianism in the Han Dynasty, corrects the mistakes in Pi Xirui&#39;s &quot;History of Confucian Studies&quot;, and corrects Wang Guowei&#39;s &quot;Han and Wei&quot; &quot;Doctoral Examination&quot;, thus making a detailed analysis of the rise, fall, increase and lack of doctorates in the three dynasties of Wu, Zhao and Xuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Referred to as a later scholar, Mr. Shen&#39;s articles have a very broad vision. They have both macroscopic concerns, covering ancient and modern times, and microscopic research, and are as meticulous as hair. At the same time, various methods are used to contain materials, and the amount of information is huge. He has unique insights into almost any issue in traditional etiquette, and almost every sentence in his article embodies the result of his thinking. His narrative language is very elegant and can be almost seamlessly connected with the cited documents, which is a state that is difficult to achieve. I also deeply agree with this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, I did not seriously read Mr. Shen’s works and papers at that time, and I was afraid to read them because they were too profound. I have only read his column in &quot;Chinese Literature and History&quot;, titled &quot;The Secret of Rituals&quot;. Sometimes several articles are published in one issue, and the length is only one or two pages, and the explanation is one word or one thing. , are all explanations of difficult issues, and are of great relevance to the study of literature and history. The elegant and concise writing impressed me endlessly. He has been writing this kind of short essays since 1946, and he has accumulated a lot of copper from the mountains. Many years later, he compiled it into a book, still named as a column. It was only a thin volume with more than 100,000 words, but it was well received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/48zsNz45py5GAydBqZLHrzAwV4pvbvSzSSnFdV4w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;801&quot; height= &quot;564&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/48zsNz45py5GAydBqZLHrzAwV4pvbvSzSSnFdV4w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256138&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Shen Wenzhuo is in the study. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I started learning to write papers, I knew that short papers were the most difficult to write because they were hundreds of words long. , more than a thousand words, how difficult it is to ask a real question, list the materials and explain it clearly! It is said that Mr. Shen&#39;s other book, &quot;An Interpretation of Different Texts on Chinese Bamboo Slips of &quot;Li&quot;&quot;, had more than 400,000 words when it was written. He was not in a hurry to publish it and repeatedly compressed it. When it was finally published, it only had 160,000 words. When we were graduate students (1982.9-1985.6), except for some papers, he had no published works. His first monograph, &quot;An Examination of Zongzhou Rites and Music Civilization,&quot; is actually a collection of his essays. It was only published in 1999. The writing spanned more than 40 years, and the total number was only 14 articles. He was already an octogenarian by then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shen has always been indifferent to fame and fortune. He said: &quot;It is not easy to manage the classics and rituals. Only when the mind is clear of &#39;devil obstacles&#39; and the mind is as clear as water, can one focus on learning and become more general.&quot; In fact, he did not write much in his life, but scholars praised him as &quot;the master of rituals.&quot; , because his articles do not rely on accumulation of quantity, but win on quality. Each of his articles solves an unsolved problem in history. Cumulatively, it is breathtaking and even more admirable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are very fortunate that Mr. Shen opened a class specifically for us. At that time, we were five graduate students, guided by five tutors. Each of them taught three classes, which constituted a semester&#39;s graduate course. Even Teacher Guo Zaiyi attended his three classes and sat in the back row. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Shen has suffered from a severe stutter since he was a child. It is very difficult for him to even speak a complete sentence. This is why he rarely attends classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The content the teachers taught at that time was self-selected and derived from years of deep thinking. In my impression, Mr. Shen Wenzhuo talked about issues related to various schools of thought in the pre-Qin period and ancient and modern texts. In my limited knowledge at that time, &quot;Lun&quot;, &quot;Mencius&quot;, &quot;Lao&quot; and &quot;Zhuang&quot; were independent writings, and I had a little dabbling in them. I had never read &quot;Mozi&quot;, and I dared not touch &quot;Li&quot; and &quot;Shu&quot;. As for each There is no understanding of the relationship between families. Mr. Shen&#39;s class revealed the intricate relationships between various schools of thought, especially the Jixia School and the famous schools. These schools, which had few works handed down to the world, used to dominate the competition with other schools, making other schools Each school had to respond and adjust; some schools that disappeared had their doctrines integrated by other schools and passed down to later generations. This made me suddenly understand that each argument was not a complete and systematic explanation of a certain theory, but an expression of its own views on the opponent. If you don&#39;t know the background of this debate, you will feel that its argument is extremely biased, like It&#39;s fighting against the air, I don&#39;t know why. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is very much like when I play center on the basketball court. Every time I hit hard, I have to push the person behind me away so that I can turn over and score the ball. You have to know how powerful the &quot;top&quot; is to understand how much effort it takes for me to &quot;rely on&quot;. If the person behind me is blurred, and people only see me turning backwards and forward into the air, they will definitely laugh at me for using too much brute force, which is the so-called &quot;biased approach&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our classroom, Mr. Shen burst out each word from his mouth vigorously. Some words took him two or three times to complete, so he wiped the sweat with a handkerchief. Still mouthing. When he talks about happy things, he will also chuckle. He first used his own research and explanation to redefine the old concepts, and then extended them to put forward new definitions for a series of issues. As a result, the related characters, events, schools and theories were swept away from the long-accumulated dust and revealed. A completely different appearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all listened attentively, lest we miss a syllable. Because the words that burst out one by one were like formation symbols flying in the air, forming a wonderful formation from which the truth of history emerged. The formation was so turbulent, with forces coming and going, waves vying with each other, sounds and principles echoing each other. This was the era of a hundred schools of thought contending! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than forty years have passed, and Mr. Shen’s specific explanation left only a few impressions on me. For example, “Book of Rites” is later than “Lidian”; &quot;Jinwen&quot; refers to Han Li, who explains the inheritance of various texts in the Han Dynasty from the perspective of the characters used in writing the texts; someone&#39;s interpretation is established as an academic official, which is &quot;learning from the law&quot; before it is established. , it is &quot;Family Law&quot;... Most of the other specific knowledge has been forgotten now. Only his &quot;chichi&quot; voice occasionally still rings in my ears, so the feeling caused by his explanation came again. It flowed through my brain like a tide, making me feel an inexplicable shock. More importantly, through these explanations, I understand that I must look through the surface of documents to feel the &quot;forces&quot; and their interactions behind the times, in order to vaguely see the &quot;invisible hand&quot; of God. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After meeting Mr. Ma Yifu, Mr. Shen wrote a poem:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Confucian Classics and Interpretation Canon 1 Furnace melting, &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Prove that the mind is the same and the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Goodness, beauty, depth and subtle appearance can be understood in different ways,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Shu Xu&#39;s rituals and music are harmonious. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also recorded: &quot;Mr. (Ma) knew about Yu&#39;s etiquette for treating Ji Dan, and he expressed the purpose of the etiquette, kindness and beauty, and was amazed by it.

After their self-employed positions in the Economic and Technological Development Zone are dismissed, they can choose to retain the establishment and have the Economic and Technological Development Zone coordinate the arrangement of new jobs, or they can Give up the establishment and work in an enterprise. The dismissed persons who were originally non-staff personnel can participate in the full-scale competition for recruitment, or they can choose to resign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shichun is a department-level cadre self-employed by Pingxiang Economic Development Zone. Facing the reform, he has two choices. Abandon the establishment.&quot; After a family meeting, he decided to stay in the business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reasons why Zhang Shichun became a self-employed cadre are not complicated. As one of the earliest economic development zones established in China, after 31 years of development, the population of Pingxiang Economic Development Zone has increased from the initial 10,000 to about 250,000 now, and its functions have also expanded from solely economic development to taking into account social management and public affairs. Services, etc., have set up their own management agencies, established their own positions, and hired their own personnel during the development process. This has both objective reasons and subjective reasons such as previous organizational establishment management was not standardized and personnel were highly arbitrary. This is also a common phenomenon in domestic development zones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Plan for the Reform of Party and State Institutions&quot;, clarifying that both the central and local governments must streamline their staffing. On this basis, many places have begun to clear out non-staff personnel. Harbin City in Heilongjiang Province, Shiyan City in Hubei Province, Chuxiong Prefecture in Yunnan Province, Huizhou City in Guangdong Province, Zhuzhou City in Hunan Province and other places have introduced plans to clear out non-staff personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pingxiang Economic Development Zone has comprehensively standardized personnel management. Among the 247 dismissed cadres, 63 people who were illegally borrowed were dismissed, 17 people were dismissed, and another 8 people gave up their business establishment to work in enterprises. After the reform, all employees will implement &quot;host management&quot; (a personnel management method in which staff and non-staff staff are hired as hosts at all levels), rather than simply &quot;throwing out&quot; non-staff staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The fired deputy minister&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shichun, who was born in 1970, worked as a teacher for 10 years after joining the workforce. His original identity was in the professional establishment. After leaving school, Zhang Shichun worked in the Education Bureau. In 1997, he was transferred to Pingxiang Economic Development Zone and later became deputy director of the Party and Mass Work Department of the Economic and Technological Development Zone Party Working Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, due to work needs, Zhang Shichun was adjusted to a large state-owned enterprise in the Economic Development Zone as deputy secretary of the party committee and secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission, and the establishment was still retained in the Party and Mass Work Department of the Economic Development Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There were quite a lot of situations like Shichun at that time.” Yu Zhifeng, deputy director of the Party and Mass Work Department, explained that from the economic development zone agencies to working in enterprises, there are still such personnel established by the agencies. , seven or eight in total. State-owned enterprises do not have public institutions, but they still retain the status of public institutions and are self-employed department-level cadres in the Economic Development Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Self-employment means self-employment. Without filing with the superior organizational department, the superior organizational department will not recognize it. If a civil servant or public servant is appointed as a deputy section-level cadre through normal organizational procedures, the superior organizational department needs to register for it, but the Economic Development Zone hires him to a full-section level without filing with the superior organizational department based on work needs. In fact, His rank is still deputy section level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020 and 2022, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee inspection team pointed out this problem during its two inspections of Pingxiang. Take 2022 as an example. In April of that year, the Fourth Inspection Team of the Provincial Party Committee inspected Pingxiang. On July 28, the Fourth Inspection Team reported the inspection situation to the Party Working Committee of Pingxiang Economic Development Zone. The third of the four main opinions was on the economic development. In the organizational work of the open area, “there is a big gap in improving the organizational system that is connected from top to bottom and has strong execution.” The inspection team put forward suggestions and suggestions for rectification, &quot;focusing on solving key issues in the personnel field of the institution.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Zhifeng introduced that the more prominent problems in the personnel field of the Economic Development Zone are that there are too many self-established institutions and too many self-employed cadres: after years of development, the number of self-employed section-level cadres in the Economic Development Zone has reached 247. There are three main categories: on-staff personnel in the Economic Development Zone, cadres transferred from higher-level agencies or brother districts and counties, and self-employed non-staff personnel in the Economic and Technological Development Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the personnel reform work was launched, the Economic Development Zone organized relevant leading cadres to conduct one-on-one interviews with the 247 self-employed cadres, led by the main leaders of the Economic Development Zone Party Working Committee. Yu Zhifeng said that the one-on-one conversations lasted for several months, mainly to explain the urgency of policies and reforms, and to &quot;patiently and meticulously do the ideological work of the dismissal target.&quot; For self-employed cadres who are already on staff, we should give them the right to choose whether to give up their staff and choose to work in enterprises or retain their staff and work in government agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shichun prefers to give up his official position and stay in the company, but he also made it clear to his family the risks of working in the company: once the company encounters difficulties in its development, his income will also drop, and may even Unemployment, &quot;After discussion, we finally decided that I would stay in the company. I also believe that the company will develop better after the reform of the Economic Development Zone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Yu Zhifeng, who carried out the dismissal work, was also a self-employed cadre. Before his dismissal, he served as party branch secretary and deputy director of the Party and Mass Work Department. After his dismissal, he remained the business editor, but only retained the position of deputy director of the Party and Mass Affairs Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Little horse and big cart&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;While dismissing 247 self-employed cadres, Pingxiang Economic Development Zone also dissolved and merged 19 self-established institutions , including the District Political and Legal Committee, District State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, District Letters and Calls Bureau, etc. Yu Zhifeng explained, “In the course of the development of the Economic Development Zone for many years, with the continuous increase in social affairs and service population, the Economic Development Zone set up its own institutions and hired a large number of cadres in violation of regulations without obtaining the consent of superiors.”&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Pingxiang Economic and Technological Development Zone was established in 1992. It was upgraded to a provincial development zone in 1995 and a national economic and technological development zone in 2010. After the area adjustment and expansion at the end of December 2021, the total area under its jurisdiction is 119 square kilometers. The permanent population is about 250,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of June 2021, there are 230 national-level economic and technological development zones. The GDP of Pingxiang Economic and Technological Development Zone has been ranked among the top 100 economic and technological development zones in the country for five consecutive years, ranking 62nd in the country in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like other economic development zones across the country, Pingxiang Economic Development Zone is also a dispatched agency of the municipal government and is a functional area rather than an administrative district. &quot;At the beginning of its establishment, the functions of the economic and technological development zone were single, mainly economic development tasks, so the higher-level departments approved a small establishment for the economic and technological development zone.&quot; Zhu Min, director of the Party and Mass Department of the Party Working Committee of Pingxiang Economic and Technological Development Zone, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Materials provided by the Economic and Technological Development Zone to Southern Weekend reporters show that the specific regional scope was not delineated at the beginning of the economic and technological development zone. After it was upgraded to a provincial development zone in 1995, the Pingxiang Municipal Government decided to divide the six The administrative village is designated as a direct development area with a development area of ​​10 square kilometers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With such an area and population, the Economic Development Zone did not need much establishment at that time.” Zhu Min said, but in the process of development, the area of ​​Pingxiang Economic Development Zone gradually expanded, and with the agglomeration of industries , Pingxiang City’s old urban area population relief and other factors have led to a sharp increase in the population of the Economic Development Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to official data released by Pingxiang City, the permanent population of the Economic Development Zone has increased from 110,000 in 2011 to 250,000 in 2021. In the same year, the permanent population of Luxi County under the jurisdiction of Pingxiang City was 260,000, and the permanent population of Lianhua County was 210,000. This means that the population managed by the Economic Development Zone is equivalent to that of an ordinary county town in Pingxiang City. In terms of economic scale, the 2022 New Year&#39;s message of the Pingxiang Economic Development Zone shows that the economic development zone completed a regional GDP of 22.3159 billion yuan in the first three quarters of 2021, ranking first in Pingxiang City. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many establishments does the Pingxiang Economic Development Zone have, which manages a population of 250,000? Zhu Min introduced that in 2022, the superior establishment department re-examined the establishment of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee. There are currently 102 public employees and 138 business employees, for a total of 240 employees. Southern Weekend reporters learned from authoritative channels that a certain district in a surrounding city has more than 700 civil servants and more than 1,000 public servants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to cope with the increasing social management functions as the population and regional area continue to increase, Pingxiang Economic Development Zone began to set up its own institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that there are basically two situations when economic and technological development zones set up their own institutions: population growth creates social management needs, and they must set up their own institutions to provide public services; municipal functional departments have vertical management needs , requiring the Economic and Technological Development Zone to set up corresponding institutions for work docking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the Economic and Technological Development Zone has set up five social work bureaus, each of which manages several administrative villages. In fact, it performs the functions of the township government or city sub-district office; the Urban Management Bureau of the Economic and Technological Development Zone, The establishment of the Garden Management Bureau was because the Pingxiang City Urban Management Bureau and the Garden Management Bureau required the Economic Development Zone to also set up a management agency to facilitate the unified planning and implementation of urban management and gardening work in Pingxiang city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some self-established institutions set up by the Economic Development Zone to coordinate line work. The Public Security Bureau of the Economic Development Zone is the Development Zone branch established by the Pingxiang Municipal Public Security Bureau. The prosecutorial functions are performed by the Procuratorate in the Development Zone established by the Pingxiang Municipal Procuratorate. The judicial institution is hosted by the Anyuan District Court and the Development Zone Tribunal is established. In order to coordinate the work of public prosecutors, prosecutors and law enforcement as well as petitions, inspections and comprehensive management, the Economic Development Zone has set up its own political and legal committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 31 years of development and construction, the Economic Development Zone has become a functional area with a high degree of industry-city integration. The functions of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee have shifted from single to comprehensive, and in fact are performing functions similar to those of district and county governments. . During an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend, a major leader of the Economic Development Zone analyzed that with the current establishment and number of personnel, the Economic and Technological Development Zone&#39;s ability to perform all management functions is a bit like a &quot;small horse and a big cart&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Lock the entrance and keep the exit smooth”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although there are too many self-established institutions and self-employed cadres, it is necessary for actual work, but it is also a matter of organizational personnel management. Caused by insufficient standards, too many agencies and cadres have also produced many adverse consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In terms of cadre team building, the superior organizational departments do not recognize the self-employed cadres of the Economic Development Zone, which has a negative impact on the growth of cadres. This is objectively not conducive to the training of cadres.” Yu Zhifeng explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Min served in the Organization Department of the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee before being transferred to the Economic Development Zone as the director of the Party and Mass Work Department. In 2019, Zhu Min went to work in the first cadre section of the Organization Department of the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee and was responsible for contacting the Economic Development Zone. “At that time, I raised the issue of irregular organizational work in the Economic Development Zone and too many self-established institutions.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government vigorously promoted the reform of the personnel system of the Pingxiang Economic Development Zone. The Municipal Party Committee Organization Department, the Municipal Party Committee Editorial Office, the Municipal Development and Reform Commission and other departments took the lead in organizing outings to learn from the experience of personnel reforms in economic development zones in other regions. . By 2022, the advancement of personnel reform will be significantly intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 11th issue of &quot;China Institutional Reform and Management&quot; magazine in 2021 published a signed article &quot;Pingxiang promotes standardized management of non-staff personnel&quot; written and edited by the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee. The article summarizes Pingxiang City’s work experience in cleaning up non-staff personnel. The overall principle is to integrate non-staff personnel and on-staff personnel into total management. The institutional establishment department shall approve the number of non-staff personnel based on the department’s functions and staffing situation. We must resolutely clean up the non-staff personnel employed in the post, and standardize the management of the non-staff personnel employed within the post. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The article also summarizes the direction of the use of non-staff personnel. It is prohibited to use non-staff personnel for administrative examination and approval, administrative law enforcement, archives management, political personnel, letters and visits, and confidentiality-related positions; insisting on &quot;doing things without hiring people&quot; In principle, employers are not allowed to use non-staff personnel for property management, security, greening maintenance, canteen services, information network services, public building facilities and equipment maintenance, etc., except for primary and secondary schools and kindergarten canteens, and all use market service outsourcing, The government purchases services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the cleanup of non-staff employees in the Economic Development Zone is also carried out within the framework of the above principles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the personnel system reform in April 2023, the Economic and Technological Development Zone implemented overall control of posts based on the personnel system reform plan approved by the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government. On this basis, the Economic Development Zone further stipulated that in accordance with the requirements of the general staff control, no new non-staff personnel will be added in the future, and only personnel within the establishment quota will be recruited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Lock the entrance of non-staff personnel into the Economic Development Zone, strengthen the assessment and management of existing personnel, implement the last elimination system, and smooth the exit.” Zhu Min said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It is by no means “sweeping out”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When dismissing self-employed cadres, the Economic Development Zone’s main concern is causing excessive reactions from the dismissal targets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Min reported on the reform plan to the main leaders of the Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee, &quot;The leader emphasized the general direction: the purpose of the reform is not to destroy your Economic Development Zone, the Economic Development Zone is still the engine of Pingxiang&#39;s economic development .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After dismantling and merging 19 self-established agencies, the work was reorganized and the functions of the dismantled agencies were merged into 8 offices including the Party and Government Office of the Economic Development Zone, the Economic Development Bureau, and the Social Development Bureau. It has internal institutions and 8 public institutions including the park enterprise service center and social governance center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Economic Development Zone breaks down the identity boundaries and implements a unified &quot;sponsoring system management&quot; for both staff and non-staff personnel. It does not distinguish whether they are on staff or not, only based on the position. The sponsorship is divided into 12 levels. Each level is divided into 12 levels. Levels correspond to different salaries. The host has a promotion and downgrade mechanism, and has set an annual assessment failure rate of 5%. It is clear that those who fail the assessment for two consecutive years will be eliminated directly, so that the host level can be moved up or down, and the salary and performance can be improved or reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhu Min’s view, the economic development zone’s gradual digestion of non-staff personnel is by no means simply “sweeping them out”, but using a sponsorship system to allow the remaining staff and non-staff personnel to compete on the same track, “Whether it is Whether within the system or outside the system, opportunities must be given to these young people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Southern Weekend reporter’s interview, the Economic Development Zone was conducting a survey. The theme was to explore a new mechanism for motivating cadres, and to build a competitive system through competition, job transfer, waiting for job, demotion, dismissal, etc. selection mechanism. Southern Weekend reporters asked several organizers of the Economic Development Zone for confirmation. They said that after the organizational reform, the work pace is faster, the work intensity is higher, and the work pressure is greater. After the National Day holiday in 2023, many organizers have been working continuously and can basically only take half a day off on weekends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason is that after the organization was dissolved and personnel were eliminated, the social management functions of the original organization were not completely divested, and various functions were divided into newly established public institutions. Therefore, the overall work The amount has not decreased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the arrival of the next round of reforms, economic and technological development zones across the country may usher in a functional &quot;downsizing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;High-Quality Development Plan for Development Zones in Anhui Province&#39;s &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot;&quot; released in March 2022 has a special chapter discussing the reform of the development zone system and mechanism, focusing on the rational division of development zone management agencies , territorial governments, and development and operation companies have real power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the &quot;Regulations on Promoting High-Quality Development of Development Zones in Henan Province (Draft)&quot; was submitted to the Standing Committee of the Henan Provincial People&#39;s Congress for its first review. The draft clarified that the Management Committee is mainly responsible for policy formulation, development planning, Administrative management functions such as administrative approval, investment promotion, and corporate services do not mention social management functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statements in both places send a signal: the functional positioning of development zones at the provincial level may still be economic development. So, how to deal with the social management functions that are gradually increasing in the development process of development zones in various places? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that in the national overall plan for the next round of institutional reform of development zones across the country, straightening out the relationship between development zones and administrative regions and gradually stripping away social affairs management functions is one of the trends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国际足联：沙特是2034年足球世界杯唯一申办方]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259759]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 19:55:17&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;FIFA announced on October 31 that the Saudi Arabian Football Association was the only one to submit a proposal to host the 2034 Football World Cup before the deadline.

But the time is mostly concentrated before 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conflicting with these past honors, there are now A4 papers posted everywhere here saying &quot;No entry for non-staff members of this floor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The 18th floor is the place where Gome receives merchants and suppliers. There are several large VIP conference rooms, and there used to be many people every day.” Zhao Qiang said. Southern Weekend reporters observed this floor for nearly half an hour, but no one came except one or two cleaning staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Gome supply chain companies responsible for providing support to merchants and suppliers are concentrated on the 16th floor. They used to include Gome Customization Company, Ningbo Gome Zhenxuan Technology Co., Ltd., etc. The original office areas of these companies have been locked. And was removed from the floor guide board. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2021, Huang Guangyu was officially released from prison after serving his sentence. He made a high-profile statement that he would strive to restore the company to its original market position in the next 18 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His biggest move after his return was the launch of the &quot;True Happiness&quot; APP, which represents Gome&#39;s retail strategy. The financial report shows that in 2021, Gome spent 962 million yuan on advertising on this APP. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Traces of &quot;True Happiness&quot; appear intensively on the 17th floor of Gome&#39;s headquarters. The red banner of &quot;Let&#39;s fight for a better career together and create a better life together&quot; is still hung in the office area, and the words &quot;12.24 9 :00-12:00 The room for the scheduled meeting of &quot;Home Appliances Division, Life Electrical Appliances&quot; has been locked. Zhao Qiang lamented, &quot;&#39;True happiness&#39; is earned by how many Gome employees work hard, work overtime and stay up late.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fifth floor of the headquarters includes the national third-party logistics company established by Gome Group in 2012.&quot; The office area of ​​&quot;Anxun Logistics&quot;, a logistics company that had previously been rumored to be planning an IPO. It&#39;s pitch dark here now. At the end of 2022, news has emerged that Anxun Logistics and its subsidiaries owed more than 3 million in freight to multiple carriers in Henan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It can be said that after 2023, the entire United States will fall into a state of deathly silence.” Zhao Qiang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/bt8FPUdo6Mqi7q4arE3fifbQywWAnz0zpzEUxeUm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/bt8FPUdo6Mqi7q4arE3fifbQywWAnz0zpzEUxeUm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256383&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The traces of &quot;really happy&quot; are still there. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Mei Ling/photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Where did the money go&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; The top 36 floors of Pengrun Building were Huang Guangyu’s office in previous reports. However, a former employee of Gome who had successfully &quot;climbed&quot; told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;Boss Huang also lives here, and there is a villa on the 36th floor that he renovated in a Chinese and Western style.&quot; If you want to climb to the 36th floor, You need to take the exclusive elevator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the past, many employees came to ask for their wages and climbed up one level at a time, causing trouble twice. Later, in order to prevent people from going there again, we couldn’t enter that level.” Zhao Qiang remembered that there had been The supplier came to ask for payment, and squatted at the door of Pengrun Building until Huang Guangyu, and &quot;followed Boss Huang to the 36th floor, but I don&#39;t know how to deal with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, many media reported the news that Daqing Gome suddenly closed down and nearly 20 home appliance dealers begged for payment but &quot;didn&#39;t know who to ask for it from.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the Judgment Documents Online, Gome was involved in 268 lawsuits in 2022, and this number reached 1,219 in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year’s lawsuits include an electrical equipment company in Foshan City, Guangdong Province requiring Foshan Gome Electric to pay a payment of 1.26 million yuan, a company in Zhejiang requiring Zhejiang Gome Electric to return rent and liquidated damages totaling 2.2 million yuan, and a construction company in Ningbo The decoration company requires Gome Electrical Appliances and Gome Retail to pay 2.4 million yuan for the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was March and April 2022 when employees who resigned began to discover problems in the company. &quot;The biggest problem is the funding problem, which means we can&#39;t settle the account,&quot; Zhao Qiang told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former employee who was directly involved in Gome’s sales and purchase still remembers that in the past, his work did not require consideration of billing issues, but starting in 2022, he was in a “pay here, then that” situation. I just can’t pay” situation. &quot;It&#39;s very intuitive to feel that cash flow is very tight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, he checked Gome&#39;s daily sales. &quot;I remember that the daily sales at that time could still reach tens of millions to 100 million or even higher, so I personally felt that it would not be overwhelming, but I don&#39;t know where the money went when it came back.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2022, &quot;employees&#39; basic salary is still there, but the performance part is rarely paid&quot;, and the situation gradually becomes more and more serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, at an all-staff meeting held in Pengrun Building, Huang Xiuhong, chairman of Gome Electric Appliances, publicly stated, “The company will only provide social security to employees and will not pay wages until the end of December. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gome also requires employees to sign a commitment letter, which mentions that “starting from October 2022, we understand that the company may delay the payment of employee wages in the next six months to one year... Commitment adjustment Have a positive attitude and believe in the company... As employees, we promise to work hard, deliver business results on time, with high quality and quantity, and achieve performance goals.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I also read this commitment letter at the time. If I don&#39;t sign it, does it make sense that I still owe back wages?&quot; Zhao Qiang said that some employees have already had zero income for a year. After his salary appeal failed, Zhao Qiang also filed for arbitration. According to the judgment, Gome owed him more than 200,000 yuan in salary plus provident fund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another manager of a relevant Gome department told a reporter from Southern Weekend, &quot;I am not owed wages, but all the children under me are owed wages. 200,000 yuan is a lot.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more unacceptable to Zhao Qiang is that starting from May 2022, Gome will no longer pay social security provident funds for its employees. &quot;But our personal contribution was deducted, and the company did not hand it over to the Provident Fund Management Center. This is the case for all employees.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is equivalent to using our money, but we don’t know where it was used. .&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An employee of the Lianyungang branch of Gome Electric Co., Ltd. told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;Since October 2022, we have realized that Gome has begun to have financial problems because wages have not been paid on time. , it was postponed until the store closed in March this year.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The employees all filed for arbitration, but they did not have much confidence. &quot;There is no money in Gome&#39;s account, so it will end in vain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gome Electric Appliances has 3,895 chain stores and more than 200 million members across the country. However, starting in 2023, news of Gome store closings appeared one after another. In October, some media reported that all Gome stores in Guangdong were closed. Later, the company responded that not all Gome stores were closed. However, published data showed that Gome reduced its self-operated stores in Guangdong Province by 12 in the third quarter. There are 74 franchise stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gome employees and consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Lianyungang and other places also told Southern Weekend reporters that Gome stores in their cities are also gradually closing. Many interviewees said, “Gome stores across the country are basically closed.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the process of store closures, situations that were unacceptable to consumers emerged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A consumer in Shanghai purchased a 7,200 yuan washing machine at the Shanghai Gome Changning Head Office in December 2022. Gome did not deliver the goods and did not refund the money. The consumer sued Gome and then mediated. Gome promised Refunds will be issued before August 2023, but there has been no news so far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Although I know that Huang Guangyu has been in and out of prison, it does not affect my shopping at Gome. I have never thought about not shipping the goods after paying,&quot; the above-mentioned consumer told the Southern Weekend reporter. Among the thousands of lawsuits involving Gome in 2023, there are a large number of similar sales disputes, employee wage arrears lawsuits, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the funding problem, in Zhao Qiang’s impression, the second change in the company is the frequent changes of direct leaders, which means that there is a problem in the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, dozens of core executives including the former Gome Online CEO, Gome Electrical Appliances CEO, and Gome Retail President have resigned since 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;How did you get to where you are today&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Huang Guangyu was born in Chaoshan, Guangdong, and is 54 years old. According to official information from Gome Group, Huang Guangyu established the first &quot;Gome Electrical Appliances Store&quot; with an area of ​​less than 100 square meters on Zhushikou Street, Qianmen, Beijing, in 1987. Gome&#39;s retail road officially started. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, Gome tried a new supply and marketing model, breaking away from middlemen and directly underwriting customization with manufacturers, launching a &quot;direct sales&quot; home appliance model. In 1993, Gome unified its store names, product display methods, store after-sales services, and publicity, becoming the prototype of China&#39;s retail chain model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2004, Gome Electric Appliances was successfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange through a backdoor approach. Huang Guangyu used this to reach the top of the Hurun Report as the richest man in mainland China with a net worth of tens of billions, and he aspired to the top spot again in 2005 and 2008. , personal wealth once reached 45 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2008, Huang Guangyu, who was at his peak, was detained by the police on suspicion of economic crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, Huang Guangyu was sentenced to 14 years in prison for illegal business crimes, insider trading and unit bribery. In June 2020, the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People&#39;s Court ruled that Huang Guangyu should be paroled in accordance with the law. In February 2021, Huang Guangyu was officially released from prison after serving his sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/qHZYecYdZ7CXsA6rbq10BtLrX0iwfuC3R4DNFtfG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/qHZYecYdZ7CXsA6rbq10BtLrX0iwfuC3R4DNFtfG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256384&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Huang Guangyu’s past honors are still on display at the Gome headquarters. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Mei Ling/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Qiang joined Gome the second month after Huang Guangyu was released from prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I have some understanding of Gome’s glory days, and I think its foundation is pretty good and its market share is huge. At that time, I thought that after Boss Huang came out, he would definitely have some new measures and methods that would bring Gome to the forefront. After vigorously developing it again and combining it with my resume, I joined.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Huang Guangyu returned in 2021, he first renamed Gome APP &quot;True Happiness&quot; as the &quot;total platform&quot; of Gome&#39;s retail ecosystem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to past media reports, when Huang Guangyu was in prison, he still communicated with company executives by writing letters. Gome executives even used drawings in their letters to try to make Huang Guangyu understand intelligence. The principles of mobile phones and APPs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Zhao Qiang said frankly, &quot;Until the day I resigned, I didn&#39;t know what the positioning of this APP was.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the &quot;True Happiness&quot; platform, there are three major scenes: competition venues, shows, and entertainment venues, as well as multiple sections such as content sharing communities, short video live broadcasts, event lists, and e-commerce shopping platforms. gather. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Qiang doesn’t know how to position this APP. Is it a community e-commerce, a hobby e-commerce, or a traditional e-commerce? In his opinion, this APP, which the boss has put all his efforts into, has no core and focus from design, product production to experience, which has a negative impact on communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is a problem for decision-makers.” However, Zhao Qiang also mentioned that by the beginning of 2022, the basic functions of the “True Happiness” platform will already be in place, and consumers can buy things and return goods normally. . As long as there is a burst point in one plate, this route can still be followed after the overall tilt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The serious internal friction within Gome made him begin to doubt the company&#39;s prospects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He gave an example. Generally, the supply chain of e-commerce platforms is relatively concentrated, but within Gome, there are several companies that are engaged in supply chain at the same time. The same product of a brand may cooperate with many supply chain companies in Gome.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These supply chain companies have only one output port, which is the &quot;True Happiness&quot; APP. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This brings a huge waste of manpower. Each supply chain company has dozens or even hundreds of people, but multiple teams do repetitive work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Every team must survive. Everyone is constantly asking for money from the group and dividing it up. The boss may want to compete, but this kind of competition is not external, it is scattered and internal.&quot; Zhao Qiang Speaking to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gome has also built a shared and co-construction platform internally that is not open to the outside world. Small businesses and suppliers can access this system after paying a certain usage fee. &quot;The biggest problem with this platform is that no one uses it. If merchants want to open a store, they can just open a store on another platform.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the &quot;True Happy&quot; APP, Huang Guangyu has also continued to It has launched a number of apps such as &quot;Decorate Home&quot; and &quot;Zheshangzhe&quot;, which puzzled the market. &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;A mid-level person from Gome Group told Southern Weekend reporters, “In addition to the decision-making issues of company leaders and lack of understanding of the market environment, they are also affected by the epidemic.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Chinese Enterprises Home&quot; reported that in late October 2021, on the 36th floor of the Pengrun Building, Gome held high-level meetings for five consecutive days. Huang Guangyu was sitting in the main seat, but staring at the iPad lying flat on the table, playing the game &quot; angry Birds&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Qiang said, &quot;Sometimes Boss Huang sleeps during the day, and meetings are held late at night, and the executives go crazy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Can it still be &quot;resurrected&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted a retired vice president-level executive about Gome’s current situation, but the other party refused to discuss the matter. In addition, all members of the public relations department of Gome Group have resigned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the domestic official website of Gome Group cannot be opened, and the “Dressing Home” and “Zheshangzhe” apps have been removed from the Apple App Store. After spending a huge amount of promotion fees, in January 2023, “True Happiness” changed its name back to “Gome” APP. At present, some brands of Gome APP have been withdrawn, and some categories such as TVs and refrigerators have been removed from the shelves. In addition, the live broadcast sales list is blank, the cleaning, repair and other services that could have been provided have been deactivated, and no one has responded to customer service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the financial report, in the first half of 2023, Gome’s retail revenue was 415 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 95.74%; it achieved a net loss attributable to the parent company of 3.539 billion yuan. During the same period, Gome Retail&#39;s current assets were only 5.326 billion yuan, and cash and cash equivalents were 146 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Gome Retail’s total liability balance is as high as 37.313 billion yuan, with an asset-liability ratio of 106.55%, making the company insolvent. Among them, current liabilities were 36.106 billion yuan, accounting for 96.78%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, starting from the second half of 2021, Huang Guangyu and Du Juan have frequently reduced their holdings of Gome retail stocks, from 60.98% of their holdings at the end of 2021 to the current 10.79%. Cashed out nearly HK$2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2021, when Huang Guangyu was officially released from prison after serving his sentence, Gome’s stock price experienced a surge. It was once nicknamed the “release concept stock” by the market. As of press time, Gome’s retail stock price was only The remaining price is 0.037 yuan per share, which is 97% lower than when he was released from prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In the past ten years, Gome&#39;s development strategy has been mainly reflected in two words - conservative, and try not to spend as much money as possible. This is Du Juan&#39;s point of view.&quot; Liu Buchen believes that in e-commerce, In an era of dominance, the decline of traditional home appliance chains is inevitable. It is just a matter of speed or slowness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the eyes of former employees, the decline and end may be more dignified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Qiang sighed, &quot;Looking back, I feel regretful. We joined Gome in the hope of helping the former myth to reshape another myth. You gave me the opportunity and I contributed my ability, but now it is difficult to come back to life. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/gs8kFYyE5HhpP4GeCU4CIBL2FXr70QkUaQp1jN3g.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/gs8kFYyE5HhpP4GeCU4CIBL2FXr70QkUaQp1jN3g.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gome&#39;s headquarters office remains in the Christmas atmosphere of 2022. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Mei Ling/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(should At the request of the interviewee, Zhao Qiang is a pseudonym in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx. net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target =&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海上危机专家谈：“我们需要的不是排外战略，而是包容的战略”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259713]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In recent years, the ocean has become an emerging development space that countries are paying attention to, and a new ocean order is taking shape. At the same time, new issues such as maritime military crises and marine ecological security have also emerged. Are we ready for the new order? How should maritime disputes be managed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now that we are entering a new maritime order, we should do our best to maintain maritime security and avoid entering a state of disorder.” Jayanath Colombaj, former commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, said. He believes that many countries rely on the ocean, and people need an interconnected system for ocean governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, 2023, at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum &quot;Maritime Military Crisis Prevention and Control&quot; group meeting, many Chinese and foreign scholars conducted in-depth discussions on issues such as maritime crises, maritime risks, maritime order and rules, etc. Discuss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/5b6586d3f0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/5b6586d3f0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256367&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 30, 2023, a number of Chinese and foreign scholars held discussions at the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing around &quot;Maritime Military Crisis Prevention and Control.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yao Yijiang/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Conflict-prone Period&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s world is facing tremendous changes, and maritime security issues have been affected A variety of factors influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retired Lieutenant General Ding Yiping, former deputy commander of the People’s Liberation Army Navy, judged: “Various risk factors are superimposed, linked, and amplified, and the maritime situation is affected by them and enters a period of conflict-prone situations.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“On the one hand, there are traditional maritime security issues, sovereignty disputes, usage disputes, resource development, fishery and other issues.” Ding Yiping mentioned, “On the one hand, there are at least 60 countries involved in maritime usage disputes alone. More than 200 maritime disputes have arisen.” On the other hand, “criminal activities such as piracy, robbery, and terrorist attacks occur frequently.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We are living in a maritime crisis.” Jayanath Colombaj is a retired lieutenant general and former commander of the Sri Lanka Navy. He is particularly concerned about maritime security issues in the Indian Ocean and its littoral countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean in the world, rich in fish and seaweed resources, and maritime trade is very developed. However, Colombaj noted that countries surrounding the Indian Ocean are still troubled by security issues, &quot;human trafficking, illegal immigration at sea They all occurred in the Indian Ocean, posing a great threat to the maritime order. In addition, there are a large number of military operations in the Indian Ocean,&quot; Colombaj said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the increasing security crisis, the deterioration of the marine ecological environment has increasingly become a problem for marine governance. In recent years, climate change has led to frequent marine disasters. Melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and rising ocean surface temperatures have caused serious harm to marine and coastal ecosystems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Yiping said, &quot;Some countries discharge industrial sewage and dump garbage into the ocean, resulting in seawater pollution and serious damage to marine ecology, while disorderly and uncontrolled development has caused the rapid decline of marine resources.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The Indian Ocean that Colombaj is concerned about is also facing ecological damage. &quot;There is a 60,000 square kilometers area in the southern Indian Ocean, and there is a large area of ​​garbage.&quot; Colombaj is worried that if it is not dealt with in time, the environmental problems in the Indian Ocean will become more and more serious. serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the frequent maritime security issues, there are also more complex national games, which are not easy to solve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Yiping said, “Because maritime disputes involve historical roots, national sentiments, economic and security interests, the countries involved are unwilling to compromise, and some major foreign countries intervene in other countries’ disputes for their own interests, resulting in disputes and confrontations. It has seriously affected the security and stability of some regions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Colombaj said that whether it is marine security management or marine environmental governance, countries are facing cooperation difficulties. &quot;There are several major obstacles to ocean governance, including a lack of trust, a lack of financial resources, a lack of political vision among leaders, a lack of public awareness, and a lack of broad policies,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;New Maritime Order&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are many &quot;strategies&quot; regarding the Indian Ocean. Colombaj believes that these strategies have led to strategic competition, strategic tightening, strategic dilemmas and strategic differences among a large number of countries surrounding the Indian Ocean, making the Indian Ocean unsafe. Similar to these strategies, there are a large number of joint initiatives in the Indian Ocean region, many of which remain on paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why do we, a small country, need so many strategies? What goals are these strategies going to achieve? Can they bring great development to the Indian Ocean region?&quot; Colombaj believes that these strategies are about &quot;order and rules.&quot; The definition is controversial; what the Indian Ocean needs is not an exclusive strategy, but an inclusive strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When things go in the wrong direction, we can look back to the starting point. For example, with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea adopted in 1982, we need to return to the original consensus.&quot; Colombaj believes that many The country relies on the ocean, and people need an interconnected system for ocean governance. For example, &quot;sustainable and integrated ocean governance and enforcement are needed&quot; and &quot;military means cannot be used once a dispute arises on the ocean.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He called on governments, non-governmental organizations, business and the private sector to unite together, because &quot;we can go fast alone, but we can go far together&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We often hear that we live in an unpredictable world. Yet it is our (researchers’) job to anticipate the ‘unpredictable’. Now, we are entering a new ocean order. To prevent There is disorder, and we need to find order in disorder,” Colombaj said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retired Lieutenant General Shekhar Sinha, former Chief of the Joint Defense Staff of India, believes that after the end of the Cold War, more and more countries have improved their economies and strengthened their military strength, and the center of gravity of the balance of world power has shifted from the West to the East. , which in turn brings more great power competition. &quot;The intensity of military conflicts at sea will increase and will continue,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shekhar is worried that violations in the military field will inevitably draw out the military, especially at sea, such as warship collisions. At the same time, the operation of military or military assets overseas involves disputes over maritime jurisdiction. The parties involved’s different understandings of history, regulations, conventions, etc. will also intensify the disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shekhar proposed that global commerce is very important and conflicts should not affect the navigation of commercial ships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that only 10%-15% of the world&#39;s ships are warships, and the rest are commercial ships. Whenever the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is violated or violated, there must be a global warning and a law enforcement mechanism to stop such violations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Warships account for a very small proportion of global ships. We must abide by relevant rules and protect commerce and trade. Conflicts between major powers are more reflected in maritime conflicts than trade conflicts.&quot; He said . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;危机管控“中国方案”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;丁一平表示，中国倡导的海洋安全理念重点可以归纳为三个方面——分别是共同维护海洋和领域安全，共同应对海上安全威胁，尊重各国海洋权益、反对海洋霸权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“海洋绝大部分是公共领域，其安全需要世界各国共同维护。”丁一平提出，要维护以国际法为基础的海洋秩序，尊重各方和平的海洋利益诉求，反对利用海洋围堵、遏制、打压他国，运用别国海洋利益矛盾挑起事端。实践证明，唯有相互信任、加强沟通、积极合作、良性互动、共同维护，才能有效保障海洋安全，实现共同利益的最大化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，如何预防和管控海上军事危机？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;丁一平提出，首要建议是达成防止涉海争端升级失控的战略公布，制止海上军事力量不当行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当前以美国为主的域外海上军事力量，在中国周边海域高频率的侦察、监视、测量活动，特别是针对中国南海、东海开展的主权挑衅行为，管控危机的强度增加，已经对海上局势危机的预防和管控构成了严重障碍。”他说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年来，美军舰频繁穿越台湾海峡，刺激台海地区局势紧张，不断对中国挑衅。台湾孙文学校总校长张亚中在会上发言称，要建立两岸的军事互信机制，或者要预防跟管理两岸的海上军事危机，最根本也是最必要的方法，就是两岸必须有“政治共识”，“台湾方面应该重新再回到&#39;九二共识&#39;的立场”。他表示，期待两岸能够有智慧摆脱外国的影响，双方自行解决两岸的政治跟军事的难题，共同为两岸创造和平而努力。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;【检察机关履职情况】&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;某区人民检察院依法受理。经听取当事人意见、调取法院卷宗和案涉土地登记原始档案、听取原审法官意见，查明：某市国土资源局主要基于案涉宅基地上房屋的《房屋继承协议》，认定支某瑞因继承房屋获得土地使用权，从而为支某瑞颁发集体土地使用证，但该继承协议列明了宅基地上房屋的5名继承人，并未写明仅由支某瑞一人继承。另查明，支某兰原系该村集体经济组织成员，婚后因孩子上学原因将户口迁出，目前生活较为贫困。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;某区人民检察院经审查认为，根据国土资源部、中央农村工作领导小组办公室、财政部、农业部《关于农村集体土地确权登记发证的若干意见》，非集体经济组织成员因继承房屋占用农村宅基地的，可按规定登记发证。本案中，虽然诉讼时支某兰并非该村集体经济组织成员，但其系支某的合法继承人，与案涉宅基地登记行为存在利害关系，法院以支某兰现非案涉土地所在集体经济组织成员，以土地颁证行为不影响其权益为由，裁定驳回起诉，适用法律确有错误。某区人民检察院提请市人民检察院抗诉。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;市人民检察院经审查，依法提出抗诉。市中级人民法院采纳抗诉意见，于2021年11月17日裁定撤销原审裁定，指令某区人民法院继续审理本案。某区人民法院于2022年9月26日作出行政判决，撤销案涉集体土地使用证。某市自然资源和规划局、支某瑞不服一审判决，提出上诉。市中级人民法院于2023年3月6日判决驳回上诉，维持原判。同时，某市人民检察院审查认为支某兰符合司法救助条件，协助其申请司法救助。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;【典型意义】&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;集体经济组织中的“外嫁女”权益保护问题成为社会普遍关注的问题。新修订的《中华人民共和国妇女权益保障法》明确规定，妇女享有与男子平等的继承权，妇女依法行使继承权，不受歧视。申请农村土地承包经营权、宅基地使用权等不动产登记，应当在不动产登记簿和权属证书上将享有权利的妇女等家庭成员全部列明。户口迁出的“外嫁女”虽然不再是原集体经济组织成员，但其通过取得宅基地上房屋的继承份额，可以登记为宅基地的使用权人。针对法院以“外嫁女”与被诉土地使用权登记行为无利害关系为由裁定驳回起诉的案件，检察机关围绕争议焦点，强化调查核实，厘清事实、准确适用法律，以高质效法律监督促进司法公正，维护妇女的合法权益。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;检察机关经审查认为，本案为土地承包经营权争议，不属于人民政府土地权属争议受案范围，终审判决并无不当。但某社区未经张某甲等法定继承人同意，以自然闭户处理收回案涉土地，侵犯了张某甲等人的继承权，且张某甲户口迁回某社区后，作为村民亦应享有相应宅基地使用权。案涉争议持续近十年，历经多轮诉讼，张某甲的合法权益一直未能得到有效维护，且有引发新诉讼的可能，两级检察机关遂决定一体开展化解工作，彻底解决其多年“程序空转”难题。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;某市人民检察院致函某镇人民政府，指出张某甲权益受到侵害客观存在，镇政府应重视张某甲合理诉求，处理好当事人房屋土地问题，避免争议激化上行，保障妇女合法权益。同时，向当地妇联通报该案情况，共同至某镇政府开展化解工作。镇政府充分听取检察机关和妇联意见后，召集政法综治中心、某社区等部门商讨解决方案，最终确定张某甲可凭村民资格，以拆迁安置价格购买一套安置房用于解决居住问题。同时，检察机关向张某甲说明重新建房已不现实，应尽早从诉累中解脱，开始新生活。张某甲感受到人民政府的诚意，同意某镇政府方案。2022年10月11日，张某甲与某镇政府签订和解协议，张某甲向检察机关撤回监督申请。该案的行政争议与民事纠纷得到实质性化解。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;【典型意义】&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;新修订的《中华人民共和国妇女权益保障法》规定，妇女在土地承包经营、宅基地使用等方面，享有与男子平等的权利。涉及村民利益事项的决定，不得以妇女未婚、结婚、离婚、丧偶、户无男性等为由，侵害妇女在农村集体经济组织中的各项权益。在办理争议历时长、关联诉讼多、民行交叉的涉损害“外嫁女”权益案件时，检察机关针对“案结事不了、程序空转”等问题，坚持人民至上、检察为民，聚焦群众急难愁盼问题，准确把握法律关系实质，统筹考虑法理情，综合运用实地走访、工作函告、协同属地妇联共同化解争议等方式“一揽子”化解行政争议与民事纠纷，切实维护农村妇女的合法权益，促进社会公平正义。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;2022年3月29日，某区人民检察院向某自然资源和规划分局发出检察建议书，建议该局：1. 对“外嫁女”进行补偿安置时，要充分保障妇女合法权益，以是否依法登记所在地常住户口作为形式要件，以是否实际在本集体经济组织生产生活为实质要件，综合判断其是否具有集体经济组织成员资格。2. 对“外嫁女”是否按单独一户进行补偿安置，制定统一的补偿认定标准。3. 完善行政应诉机制，提升依法行政水平，维护政府公信力。检察建议发出后，某区人民检察院与某自然资源和规划分局、某区妇联多次召开联席会，交流意见，共商整改重点。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2022年4月27日，某自然资源和规划分局书面回复，表示进一步完善征地拆迁安置政策和补偿认定标准；严格落实“三轮会审”机制，及时梳理总结涉拆案件情况；提升自身应诉能力水平。2022年5月，某自然资源和规划分局制定新的《征拆安置政策和补偿认定标准》手册，对“外嫁女”制定了统一的身份认定、户型认定的补偿标准，按单独一户标准对符合规定的王某等“外嫁女”及其子女计算安置补偿费。聘请4名专职律师负责行政应诉工作，从源头堵塞行政应诉不规范问题。某区人民检察院与某区妇联会签《检察监督保障妇女权益协作配合机制意见》，在线索移送、支持起诉、行政争议化解、司法救助等多方面达成合作意见，建立长效机制。2022年6月以来，该区未再发生因“外嫁女”补偿安置标准不统一而引发的行政诉讼。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;检察机关由该案进一步推动行政机关制定科学、合法、可行的土地征收安置补偿政策。目前，某区政府已修订土地征收安置补偿方案，涉“外嫁女”安置政策得以调整。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;【典型意义】&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;男女平等是我国的基本国策。党的二十大报告强调“坚持男女平等基本国策，保障妇女儿童合法权益”，充分彰显党中央对妇女儿童事业发展的高度重视。新修订的《中华人民共和国妇女权益保障法》也要求检察机关在履职中加强对妇女权益的保护。检察机关在履职过程中，坚持问题导向，针对将“外嫁女”土地征收安置补偿权益排除在外，违反男女平等基本国策及相关法律规定的现象，通过一体化办案、成立联合办案组、院领导包案、府检联动、法检联动等方式，依法开展监督，妥善化解争议，有效维护妇女合法权益。同时，通过案件办理，推动地方政府在行政管理中重视妇女权益保障，完善土地征收安置补偿政策，有力提升社会治理法治化水平。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;检察机关经审查认为，因俞某未分户且所建房屋未能办理审批手续，终审判决并无明显不当，但俞某的权益并未得到充分保障。本案系历史遗留问题，涉及村民自治规则的正当性、传统观念根深蒂固等问题，争议化解难度大。为此，检察机关联合当地妇联，多次组织当事人协商，赴政府商谈，引导当地政府切实增强男女平等意识，依法保障妇女在农村土地征收补偿安置以及宅基地使用等方面享有与男子平等的权利。同时，多次赴俞某家实地开展联合走访慰问，为俞某提供心理疏导和关爱帮扶，减少其对立情绪。为进一步厘清外嫁女的相关法律、政策问题，2022年6月23日，检察机关就该案召开听证会，并邀请具有市区两级妇联代表身份的听证员参与。会上，双方围绕争议焦点充分表达意见、听证员现场提问，明晰案件事实，就和解方案进行全面评估与多次磋商。最终镇政府一次性补偿数十万元，合计先前赔偿的90万元，俞某得到的补偿与拆迁补偿的标准基本接近，双方达成和解协议，俞某撤回监督申请。长达五年的行政争议得以实质性化解。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;【典型意义】&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;新修订的《中华人民共和国妇女权益保障法》明确规定，国家采取必要措施，促进男女平等，消除对妇女的一切形式的歧视，禁止排斥、限制妇女依法享有和行使各项权益。妇女在土地征收补偿安置以及宅基地使用等方面，享有与男子平等权利。针对历史遗留问题，检察机关在办案过程中，坚持系统思维，统筹考虑拆迁安置争议形成的法律问题、社会成因和历史因素，为避免给当事人增加诉累，纾解其面临的现实困难，通过公开听证、联合商谈、入户走访等方式，推动当地政府研究制定合理的补偿方案，促成当事人达成和解协议，实质性化解行政争议，实现政治效果、社会效果、法律效果有机统一。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;2021年1月6日，周某以村委会某村村民小组侵害其集体经济组织成员权益为由向某市某区人民法院起诉，法院判决确认周某未丧失村集体经济组织成员资格，仍系某村集体经济组织成员。某村村民小组应向周某支付土地补偿费80246元。该村村民小组不服，提出上诉、再审申请均未获支持。期间，周某两次请求某镇人民政府、某镇农业服务中心帮助解决确认集体经济组织成员资格问题，镇政府一直未处理，某村村民小组一直未支付土地补偿款。周某向某市某区人民检察院申请监督。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;2022年9月7日，某镇人民政府作出书面回复，已采纳检察建议，协调村小组人员确认周某集体经济组织成员资格，并已将周某录入集体经济组织成员身份系统，向其出具了集体经济组织成员股权证，并按程序分期向周某支付土地补偿款。2022年11月1日，周某签署了息诉承诺书。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;【典型意义】&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;据了解，近期一款名为“萝卜刀”的新型玩具在中小学生（幼儿）群体中走红。该玩具是一种外形酷似胡萝卜的彩色塑料玩具刀，由于该玩具本身具有攻击性，存在一定的安全隐患，又会形成心理暗示，激发孩子暴力倾向，对未成年人安全健康成长产生不良影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为此，广东省教育厅要求，加强对学生的安全教育。各地各校（园）要进一步加大安全教育力度，让学生（幼儿）认识到“萝卜刀”等玩具的危险性，自觉拒绝“萝卜刀”等危险性有害玩具，做到不购买、不携带、不玩耍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加强对家长的安全提醒。要采取多种形式提醒家长认真履行监护责任，务必选择正规厂商出产的、适合孩子年龄阶段、有益身心健康发展的儿童和学生用品，不要为孩子购买“萝卜刀”等危险性有害玩具。在玩具使用前，要仔细阅读包装上的警告和提醒内容，做好孩子使用时的安全防范。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;严格对校园的安全管理。各中小学校、幼儿园要严禁此类危险性有害玩具进入校园，在进行安全教育的基础上，对仍带入校园的此类有害玩具，要清查封存。被封存的危险性有害玩具，要通知学生（幼儿）家长到学校接受教育，在作出承诺之后可由家长领回，并督促其销毁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加强对校园及周边的治理。学校要管好校园内商店，不得售卖此类危险性有害玩具。要关注校园周边商店，发现有售卖此类危险性有害玩具的，要报告属地市场监管等职能部门，由职能部门查处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各地教育部门要会同相关部门深入开展儿童和学生用品安全治理，以“萝卜刀”等存在物理危害、化学危害、可燃性危害、心理暗示等危险性有害玩具产品为重点，加大校园周边商铺和流动摊贩管理力度，一旦发现存在售卖危险性玩具产品和学生用品的，要严肃查处。各地级以上市教育局于11月10日前，将排查治理工作情况反馈省教育厅。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这是贵州茅台自2018年元旦以来，时隔近六年再次提高出厂价。贵州茅台的核心单品飞天茅台出厂价将从此前969元/瓶，上调至约1169元/瓶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一重磅消息瞬间引爆了酒圈。多位行业人士在11月1日凌晨对南方周末记者表示，对于贵州茅台在这个时间点提价，感到有些震惊，并且超出预期。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;受提价消息刺激，11月1日，贵州茅台集合竞价高开9.82%，成交金额超12亿元。开盘后，贵州茅台股价从上一个交易日的1684.58元/股拉至1850元/股，改变了近期表现略显低迷的走势。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;贵州茅台发布的公告中提及：此次调整不涉及本公司产品的市场指导价格。此次价格调整将会对本公司经营业绩产生一定影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月1日上午，南方周末记者以投资者身份致电贵州茅台董秘办，相关工作人员回复：“我们公告写得很清楚，此次调整的是出厂价，1499元的市场指导价是没有动的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于为何这个时间点进行提价，上述工作人员表示：“由于我们已经接近六年没有做出价格调整，充分考量了宏观经济环境、市场供需变化等因素，坚持以市场、顾客为中心，兼顾企业长远发展，市场长期稳健基础上，调整产品的出厂价格，这是一个正常的、合理的企业经营行为。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据南方周末记者不完全统计，贵州茅台从2001年上市以来，此次调价是第八次，此前调价的时间分别在2001年、2003年、2006年、2008年、2010年、2012年、2018年。而此次调整的间隔时间，是茅台上市以来最长的一次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长期研究茅台公司的鹤禧投资董事长霍东杰对南方周末记者表示：“此前茅台涨价一般是在白酒周期向上的时候，但近期飞天茅台价格比近几年同期都要弱，譬如历史上，中秋期间是涨价的，今年却是跌的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全国最大白酒批发市场百荣市场酒商提供的数据显示，2023年10月31日，53%vol贵州茅台酒的散装飞天价格为2650元/瓶，而在2023年6月下旬，散装飞天价格为2820元/瓶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，多位受访者对南方周末记者表示，此次提价，部分经销商的利润将转给茅台，主要影响的是经销商以及经销商以下酒商的渠道利润。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑州玺韵实业总经理王占甫认为，目前白酒市场除茅台外的名酒品牌核心产品都倒挂严重，此次提价，一方面是行业老大的担当，还有对集团2023年度增长压力的有效释放。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“经销商利润就普茅而言本就是暴利，所以此次调价，对经销商的影响并不大，何况经销商会推高流通价，这是贵州茅台强大的品牌张力决定的，其它品牌没有。”王占甫对南方周末记者表示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为郑州资深酒商，11月1日上午，王占甫也在密切关注飞天茅台的流通价格，但截至南方周末记者发稿，他表示：“目前酒商大概率不出货，会观察一下。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另有受访者表示，此次提价意味着贵州茅台效益的提高以及渠道利润的再分配。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年1-9月，贵州茅台实现营业收入1032.68亿元，归属于上市公司股东的净利润为528.76亿元。此时调价，意味着2023年最后两个月，将为茅台带来更多营收及净利润。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;霍东杰对南方周末记者表示：“我们初步评估，此次调价，将对贵州茅台明年盈利提升6%。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据方正证券估算，此次茅台出厂价由969元提升20%后，约增厚2023年收入62亿元，增厚幅度约4.2%，约增厚净利润41亿元，增厚幅度约5.6%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国酒业智库专家、知趣咨询总经理蔡学飞认为，此次提价有利于提振目前低迷的行业信心，合理的涨价预期也会刺激和拉动相关消费增长，同时呼应长期以来的资本市场需求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;茅台提价&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;的背后&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;对于此次茅台提价，多位受访者表示既在意料之中又在意料之外。毕竟，距离上一次贵州茅台提价，已经过去了近六年，在此期间，茅台何时上调出厂价，一直是市场关注的焦点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长期持有茅台股票的一位资深投资者对南方周末记者表示：“从茅台自身讲，前年就强烈希望提价了，但最后没批准，企业诉求很强。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年，白酒行业掀起涨价潮，但茅台并没有跟进。在贵州茅台2022年度及第一季度业绩说明会以及2023年6月的股东大会上，茅台董事长丁雄军也多次回应提价问题，他曾表示，要按照价格法等相关法律法规来定茅台酒的价格，定价也会考虑供求关系等因素，“我们一定会充分遵循市场的规律，呼应市场的需求”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位不愿意透露姓名的白酒行业资深人士对南方周末记者表示：“茅台的特殊地位以及经济影响力，决定了茅台的价格调整是极其敏感的，往往涉及企业、政府等多方意见，并且有着严格的论证与保密流程。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该人士指出，此次提价确实很突然，但明显有提振信心的意图。另一位长期投资茅台超过二十年的投资机构负责人则对南方周末记者表示：“此次提价，是呵护资本市场政策的一部分。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从企业自身来看，近年来，贵州茅台已经通过减少经销商数量，拓展直销渠道，增加直营店，推出i茅台平台等方法，不断提升直销收入的占比。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年至今，贵州茅台经销商总数从3083家减少到截至2023年三季度末的2082家。千家经销商的减少，带来了贵州茅台直销业务占比的持续增长。 2022年，贵州茅台直销业务占比达到40%，2023前三季度，贵州茅台直销收入同比增长44.93%，达到462.07亿元，占总营收的比重约为44.92%。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;从巨大的穹顶式入口进入成都科幻馆，需要经过多道安检。开幕式展示了中国式晚会的一些常用元素——主持人高亢的朗诵、色彩饱和的舞台、撑满空间的群舞，但主办方在其中加入了尽可能多的科幻元素，来凸显这届大会的主题“共生纪元”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“中国的科幻迷文化与我成长时所接触的文化并没有长达几十年的广泛交流，我还有许多超出以往经历的东西需要学习。”本届大会联合主席本·亚洛表示，“当然，对于世界科幻大会的文化，中国科幻迷也有许多需要了解的地方。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“会员文化”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;10月下旬的成都已经有了寒意，也早早过了学生的暑假时间。2021年成都在申办世界科幻大会的时候，很多学生科幻迷为了能在暑假一睹科幻盛会，纷纷花钱注册第79届华盛顿世界科幻大会会员（约合人民币六百多元），为成都投票。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按照《世界科幻协会章程》，各种名目不同的会员资格均可以购买，而购买当年的会员资格，就可以给两年后的申办城市投票，也可以为雨果奖的入围作品投票。这种做法类似于“众筹”，历届世界科幻大会的预算绝大多数来自会员的购买支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是世界科幻迷中特有的一种会员文化。1950年代，雨果奖设立不久，就增加了粉丝类的奖项，科幻迷自己写的作品、自己办的业余杂志，也可以站上雨果奖的领奖台，与那些“大牛”们的作品交相辉映。世界科幻大会的三大传统核心议题——雨果奖投票评选、事务会议和未来大会的选址投票，无不与普通科幻迷的参与息息相关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“它的魅力就在于它是一种基于创造者社区的精神，每一个人既是参与者，又是创造者。这是文化传统赋予它的东西，不是能够随便取代或复制的。”本届大会联合主席陈石对南方周末记者说，让他感到遗憾的是，对于许多幻迷来说，这是一次无法抵达的大会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年1月20日，成都组委会在推特上宣布举办日期从2023年8月16日推迟到10月18日。“我身边至少有一百多个幻迷朋友来不了。”大学生千星说。他所在的学校离成都很远，他是少数能请得出假的人。千星穿着一套银蓝色的cosplay服装来到会场，非常显眼。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果这些幻迷们能够来到成都科幻馆现场，他们在这座庞大、中空的建筑里，会首先看到大厅里一个高达9米的巨型“笨笨”塑像（电影《流浪地球》里的机器人），到了晚上，围绕它的射灯让它表面的颜色开始流动，制造出各种不同状态的“笨笨”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一楼的两个大型展厅分别为企业展厅与科幻迷展厅。企业展厅的几十个展位绝大多数为中国企业，有卖科幻文创的，也有做投影的，更多的是做科幻出版的。他们展位的声光电效果夺人耳目，与旁边的幻迷展区明显不同。企业展厅是此前的世界科幻大会不曾有过的单元。政府的支持、企业的参与、大量赞助商的品牌推广，都让大会有了更多的官方色彩与商业价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科幻馆附近没法满足这么多参展商的出行与餐饮需求。一位参展商告诉南方周末记者，“哪种票要怎么走、车怎么安排，议程怎么分布”，都是来了之后自己慢慢摸索出来的；这个崭新的会场周边商业还很稀少，如果不想吃会场内的餐饮如肯德基和赛百味，每天中午得去几公里外找吃的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和企业展区的酷炫相比，科幻迷展区显得朴素许多。一张桌子、一面旗帜、一张介绍卡片或者二维码，他们来自大学社团、国外的科幻组织，还有未成名的业余作者……有点像大学社团的招新现场。藏语科幻社团的桌子上，摆放着多年来出版的藏语科幻作品，一位藏族小伙耐心地给好奇的围观者介绍藏语科幻的历史。这样的氛围，更像此前的世界科幻大会，科幻文学研究学者严锋曾经参加过2019年都柏林世界科幻大会，回忆起那边的氛围，“自由散漫。”他说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科幻馆二楼与三楼的会议室都被用来举办各种“沙龙”。所谓“沙龙”，就是科幻迷们自己组织的各种研讨会。科幻迷们自己邀请嘉宾，自己定选题，呈报给组委会之后，一般都会通过，然后组委会安排时间、场地，不再过问其他事务。历届世界科幻大会的沙龙场次稳定在三四百场之间。成都世界科幻大会报名的沙龙有四百多场，最终保留了230多场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次成都组委会一共邀请了六百多位嘉宾，其中海外嘉宾180多人（到场150多人），他们构成了沙龙的主力群体。过去的世界科幻大会，官方邀请的嘉宾只占很少一部分，其他参加沙龙的是科幻迷自己邀请的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈石在芝加哥世界科幻大会上也申请过一个沙龙。“我就带个表格，组委会直接跟我说地点、时间，你自己搞就OK了，他们就不怎么管你了。”陈石说，“在中国的文化背景下，可能这样并不合适。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“国外的世界科幻大会，对幻迷圈很有吸引力，但不出圈，他们的核心会员就两万多人，每年来的人变化不是很大，形成了自己的社群文化，要进入这个社群是有文化门槛的。如果我们完完全全照搬那个的话可能会非常惨，这个东西很难进入各个圈层。”当一开始陈石思考要办一届怎样的世界科幻大会的时候，他就已经决定要走一条不一样的路。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨枫是科幻类出版企业八光分的CEO，她主编的《中国科幻口述史》也入围了2023年的雨果奖。她参加过多届世界科幻大会。她向南方周末记者回忆着此前的那些沙龙和展览，“那就像是科幻迷的party（聚会），没有多少&#39;高大上&#39;的设计，各种各样的coser（二次元形象模仿者）满场走，也有人围一个小圈子，整天弹吉他。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让她流连忘返的还有曾经的跳蚤市场，每一年，科幻迷们都把自己的收藏、手工艺品、二手书拿到世界科幻大会的跳蚤市场拍卖，每个人在一个小牌子上写上自己心仪的价格，价高者得，“几乎每届我都拍到了我喜欢的东西”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“事务会议”&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;的&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;质询、辩论&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;和&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;投票&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“您好，您的发言并不关涉到是与否的问题，而是另一个话题。”“您好，您的发言时间到了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;千星的发言不时地被主席台上的计时员打断。这是千星第一次来到世界科幻大会，也和绝大多数中国科幻迷一样，第一次体验事务会议。很多中国科幻迷流连于展区与沙龙，却往往忽视了这个重要会议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但老科幻迷们都知道，“去参加事务会议，才能对世界科幻协会、世界科幻大会的组织方式和参与方式有一个深入的理解，而且你会感觉到一些好玩的地方。”陈石说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“事务会议”是每一届大会的重要议程，甚至是核心议程。在这个连续四五天的会议上，会员们经过质询、辩论、投票，对世界科幻大会的各种事务进行监督，也负责修改世界科幻大会的基石——《世界科幻协会章程》的某些条款。英语中，这个章程被称为“constitution”（宪法）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这场会议的实践对于大多数中国科幻迷来说，都显得新鲜，甚至有点刺激。“什么是落日条款？”遇到不懂的法律名词，他们在现场也会坦诚地表达出来。他们的问题被来自全世界的人认真倾听。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果亲身感受过事务会议的流程与辩论，就不难理解幻迷圈为何将该会议称为“修宪会议”。成都世界科幻大会的事务会议放在了科幻馆的流星厅，这是一个独立于主馆的小厅，具有会员资格的人可以随时进入旁听、发表意见和投票。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;千星是在场中国会员中发言最为积极的，几乎每个议题，他都要发表自己的看法，说到忘我处，往往超出发言时间，被要求终止发言——这是一场严格按照《罗伯特议事规则》进行发言辩论的会议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“今年人来得少，往年更热闹。”八光分影视总监西夏对南方周末记者说。每年事务会议之前会有一个预备会议，讨论事务会议的具体安排。往年的预备会议也热闹非凡，往往主持人开讲没几分钟，就有会员跳出来质疑各种安排，“有的人说要配几个翻译，有的人说屏幕要怎么显示，最后双方各辩论两分钟预备会议要不要开始。”陈石回忆。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于来的人少，副审裁官凯文·斯坦利对陈石透露，2023年应该是预备会议上“扯皮”最少的一届。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;流星厅里远远没有坐满，门口放着厚厚的两本书，《罗伯特议事规则》的中英文版本，会员若对辩论流程有意见，可以随时查阅质询。西夏这次带来了自己的“宪法修正案”，他想要增设一个雨果奖奖项，颁给独立电影人制作的科幻电影，他认为目前的“最佳戏剧表现（长片）”这一奖项过于重视商业大片而忽视独立电影了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1950年代的幻迷大多是科幻小说的拥趸，于是最先设立的雨果奖便是1953年的最佳长篇小说奖，此后慢慢地追加了粉丝杂志、戏剧表演和漫画类的奖项。如果翻看历年得奖的电影，会发现大多数是好莱坞的商业大制作，西夏认为有必要改变这种状况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“打个比方，小说的奖项，我们已经有给商业上最成功、最有名的小说发奖，但还有一些粉丝创作的、没有得到商业关注但是圈里面觉得写得很好的小说，雨果奖会给他们颁最佳粉丝作者、最佳粉丝杂志、最佳粉丝播客。这样的奖项电影类也应该有一个。”西夏说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;想要在“修宪会议”上通过新的修正案，至少需要两年时间。提案如果能在第一年的大会上辩论通过，就会变成正式的修正提案，第二年再次进行二审辩论，通过之后才算“修宪”成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年进行二审辩论的有两个提案，其中一个是“是否增设雨果奖最佳游戏或互动作品的奖项”。在场的中国会员们似乎对这一提案普遍持谨慎态度，他们质疑“游戏”的定义，尤其是科幻类游戏的边界似乎并不清晰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“辩论时间结束。请支持这一提案的人站起来……反对这一提案的人站起来……”审裁官唐纳德·伊斯特雷克说。最后的投票结果为10：3，修正案通过，这意味着今后雨果奖就要增设这一奖项了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;千星最激动的一次发言针对的是一个2023年的新提案。这一由凯文·斯坦利提出的新提案呼吁，此后的世界科幻大会在举办时间上最好在8月1日到9月30日之间，如果超出这一范围，应该和下一届的主办城市进行协商。千星的意见是，除了要和下一届主办方协商，还需要和会员们商量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“会员大会的参与者，有权利知道大会要更改日期。他们和组委会协商，组委会可以不采用这个会员的意见，但是这样协商的环节一定要有，一定要有表达意见的环节。”事务会议的休息空档，南方周末记者采访了千星。他看上去有些激动，大步走上主席台，发言语速慢却有力，希望把这个和会员协商的条款增补进凯文的提案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过投票，凯文的提案获得了通过，千星的增补条款没有获得通过。然而，整场会议都有视频摄录，千星的发言与意见已经被记录，成为了世界科幻大会的永久历史档案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;西夏的提案也获得了初审通过。等到明年的格拉斯哥世界科幻大会，凯文与西夏的提案会被会员们再次审视、辩论、投票。《世界科幻协会章程》通过这种方式，让世界科幻大会回应着时代的变化与幻迷的诉求。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;创纪录、创历史&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年10月21日晚，第81届成都世界科幻大会颁出了这一届雨果奖。在此之前，本届奖项提名增加了不少有色面孔，中国入围者令人瞩目。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国插画师赵恩哲获得了最佳职业艺术家奖，中国科幻迷河流与零始真编辑的《零重力报》获得了最佳粉丝杂志奖，科幻作家海漄的小说《时空画师》获得了“最佳短中篇小说奖”。按照雨果奖的传统，大会组委会要在颁奖之后公开投票的细节和数据，比如2022年芝加哥世界科幻大会的数据现在依然可以在官网上查到。这次大会之后，雨果奖官网上写道：“目前我们并没有此次投票数据的细节。我们将在获得数据的第一时间公布。”成都世界科幻大会中文官网上也暂时未能查到这个数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雨果奖评选委员会负责人戴夫·麦卡蒂在颁奖晚会后对记者说：“海漄的《时空画师》并没有英文译本，它创造了一个无英文译本、完全由中文作品获奖的历史。”这就意味着，给《时空画师》投票的会员可能大多是中国读者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;颁奖第二天，刊载《时空画师》的《银河边缘》（mook）在科幻馆内被销售一空，由于询问的人太多，科幻迷展区的售书摊上不得不挂出“售空”的牌子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样卖得火热的当然还有刘慈欣作品，10月20日下午两点是刘慈欣的签售会，其他作家的签售一般只被安排了20分钟，主办方给刘慈欣预留了三个小时的签售时间。粉丝们早早挤满三楼签售大厅，队伍从三楼一直延伸到一楼，再蜿蜒绕了半圈的会场，很多站到腿酸的粉丝坐到了大刘的书上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来参展的各家出版机构想要在这个会场里签售自己的图书，并不容易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;希希是一家出版机构的编辑，这次他带来了一位作者的科幻小说到成都，还组织了一个沙龙，希望科幻迷们可以和作家本人好好聊聊，再办一个签售会。一开始，希希把整个流程都申报给了组委会，但到了开幕前几天收到通知，沙龙不能和签售放在一起。“平时的书展活动，作者和读者交流完之后有签售，但这里两个场地一定要分开，时间段也会分开。”希希说。这也就意味着，对作者有兴趣的读者，得跑两趟才能获得签名本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;世界科幻大会会场里的沙龙、论坛、峰会林林总总，但是除了开闭幕式、雨果奖颁奖晚会之外，还有一场“产业发展峰会”，几乎所有主要嘉宾都被邀请出席了这场峰会，阵容堪比雨果奖颁奖之夜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是第一次在世界科幻大会上举办产业发展的相关会议。会上，多项科幻产业发展相关的计划被公布，包括《科幻产业成都共识》、“天问”计划、《2023中国成都科幻产业报告》等，甚至还有科幻产业项目的集中签约仪式，据统计有21个签约项目，总投资达80亿元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这个“产业发展峰会”上，刘慈欣也不再聊文学，而是对产业发展侃侃而谈，：“成都很早就谋划布局科幻产业，相关的产业规划、产业政策、人才政策等均已落地实施。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“科幻全产业链生态圈”“IP打造”“强化科幻之都形象”，面对这些五花八门的新鲜词汇，加拿大科幻作家罗伯特·索耶表示，“看到你们把科幻变成产业，感到非常震惊。”他说，在北美做这些事情的可能是出版商，科幻就是随意的、漫无目的的、没有长期规划的一个事业。这些产业界人士在以往的世界科幻大会上一般不被邀请，来的大多是作家、编辑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成都科幻馆所在的这一片区域，也将被打造为成都的科幻高地。据一位接近当地政府的人士向南方周末记者介绍，这里以后可能要建一个科幻产业园，“那条街就是一个科幻主题的街区，一家家科幻企业后续可能会入驻，这一片说是要搞一个科幻露营基地，每年会做科幻作家的训练营和学生的夏令营，而科幻馆本身是一个大型的消费+公益结合的空间，这一圈会打造成一个科幻主题的旅游目的地。”他站在高台之上，手指从这一头划向那一头，划出一个大大的弧线。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当地政府做了场馆、交通等保障工作，还发动了很多志愿者，”陈石说，“诉求核心就两点，一是提升成都的城市品牌形象，二是扶持科幻产业。”这届大会还创下了一个纪录——它拉到了有史以来最多的赞助商。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;是什么让中国年轻人喜欢科幻？”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;午后的幻迷展区，喧嚣异常，即便这一天已经是世界科幻大会的最后一天。一个机器人鼓手在角落里循环敲击着鼓点，家长带着孩子们坐了两个小时的公共交通，现在刚刚入馆，孩子们手上拿着敲章打卡的本子，尖叫着穿梭于各个展台之间。还有一位科幻迷拿着自己写的书在宣传：“我写的书和刘慈欣的世界观截然相反……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这片喧闹海洋之中，有一个人在椅子上打盹儿。他满头白发，牛仔帽放在桌上，双眼低垂，像是进入了另一个世界。他叫詹姆斯·约瑟夫，来自澳大利亚，七十多岁的他已经当了近五十年科幻迷。1975年，世界科幻大会第一次在大洋洲举办，他被科幻的氛围打动，至今已经去过15次世界科幻大会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;詹姆斯对南方周末记者说，这次大会是他去过的最特殊的一届，以前不管是在欧洲还是美国，从来没有见过这么多热情而年轻的科幻迷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;年轻，是这届大会的一个关键词。“我今天签的名比过去56年加起来还多。”被找他签名的小学生们团团围住，尼古拉斯·怀特显得有点受宠若惊，学生们顺着摊位，一家一家地打卡、要签名。组委会和成都很多中小学达成合作，组织了很多学生去各种沙龙与论坛旁听，科幻馆里几乎没有冷场的时候。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2025年西雅图申幻组委会成员艾伦·布兰特对南方周末记者说，成都世界科幻大会的规模是他见过最大的。此前这项纪录的保持者是2014年的伦敦，参会人数在1万人左右。而据官方媒体公布的数字，成都的参会者超过了2万。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在西方，科幻文学的黄金年代是二战之后的几十年。当时正值美苏争霸，西方经济高速发展，科幻文学顺势而动，成为当时很多年轻人的精神家园。半个多世纪过去，当年的科幻迷们垂垂老矣，像詹姆斯·约瑟夫这样的西方老科幻迷，他们的银发是成都科幻馆里的亮点。“对于美国的科幻作品来说，很多读者都是灰头发，也就是中老年人才会读科幻作品，但是中国相反，年轻人更喜欢科幻作品。这是我的困惑，是什么让中国年轻人喜欢科幻？”罗伯特·索耶在成都提出了这个问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前的每次大会，都会专设一个缅怀区域，这是一个中老年科幻迷怀旧、叙旧的地方。2017年，英国科幻作家布莱恩·奥尔迪斯去世，当年的世界科幻大会就有一个小小的空间，里面展陈着他生前的作品、照片，和一些他收藏的宝贝，一台朴素的黑白电视机，播放他生前的采访视频。2023年，奥尔迪斯的女儿温蒂也来到了成都，她告诉南方周末记者，原本成都世界科幻大会要为这些照片举办一个展览，但后来“因为空间不够”，没能实现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨枫原本也打算在大会上办一个缅怀的展览。缅怀的人物是美国科幻杂志《银河边缘》的前主编迈克尔·雷斯尼克。2020年，雷斯尼克去世之后，他的收藏和图书被挂到网上拍卖，八光分买到了大量他的藏品，“你看这个玻璃展柜里全是他的东西。”杨枫指着一个玻璃柜说。一开始，主办方答应给70平米的展陈面积。由于担心错过会期，藏品“花了上万元运费运回来”。后来展区被很多科技企业挤占，只给了杨枫一面玻璃展柜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他们的黄金年代确实已经过去了。”严锋说，“而中国的科幻热又有很多网络的特征，我在这里看到很多人追星，听到很多尖叫，特别是对大刘和郭帆这样的人。中国科幻发展起来有它的幸运，网络文化的助推是非常有力的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成都本土科幻作家何夕认为，目前的中国科幻处于第三次浪潮初期。“第一次是建国之初百业俱兴，第二次是1979年&#39;科学的春天&#39;，现在是第三次。”他说。另一位已经封笔的科幻作家王晋康也回忆了1990年代中国科幻的低潮期，“那时候中国科幻是野生野长，不太被社会关注，但是也有很多科幻迷，我们到大学里参加活动，都是用粉笔在黑板上写一个&#39;欢迎王晋康先生&#39;，就这样开始交流。那时的简陋也有它的情趣，现在还很怀念。现在确实不一样了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你能在大会的会场里隐隐感到一种科幻文化的冲突，”《零重力报》的编辑零始真对南方周末记者讲述了他的观察，“但我并不认为这种冲突是一种有害的，或者没有意义的东西，这是一个必经的过程。既然你要拥抱一个真正多元的世界，这一步是逃不开的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为大学老师，严锋已经很久没有在国内的学术会议上见过那么多国际友人了，这让他颇为感动，“目前这个分裂的世界，越来越相互隔绝，甚至对抗、敌视，但是科幻肯定是要超越国界来思考人类层面的问题，这也是科幻可贵的地方。”就像刘慈欣曾在不同场合所强调的，“科幻小说里，人类是作为一个整体出现的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;艾伦·布兰特说西雅图世界科幻大会已经搞定了场馆，但当地的科幻协会还在和酒店谈判，以期拿到更低的价格。尼古拉斯·怀特说自己有点“嫉妒”成都，明年的格拉斯哥世界科幻大会他估计拉不到这么多赞助：“很显然，成都世界科幻大会得到了当地政府的巨大支持，这在欧洲是很难实现的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（希希、千星为化名，南方周末实习生陈荃新对本文亦有贡献）&lt;/p>;
