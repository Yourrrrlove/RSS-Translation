Playing electronic games for their children is like attracting a scourge. . In order to prevent children from playing games, they resorted to all possible means in a battle of wits and courage. Some parents sent their children to a certain school and used electric shock therapy, causing many injuries and disabilities. In this context, I think it is very necessary to clarify the nature of video games and rectify the name for children who love games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is the nature of animals and humans to love games. Scholar Schiller said that people are real people only in a state of play. In the game state, people are fully relaxed and free. In the game, you will invest your creativity and thoughts infinitely, bursting out with endless vitality. In order to play games, many children have used their great creativity to learn English and strategies on their own. Games are not only a form of entertainment, but also a platform to express personality and showcase talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is undeniable that games have many beneficial functions. The famous futurist Jane McGonigal believes that games have four major characteristics: goals, rules, feedback systems and self-involvement, which can greatly enhance players&#39; happiness. Of course, games can also cultivate children&#39;s teamwork spirit, enhance children&#39;s awareness of rules, and improve children&#39;s concentration and innovation abilities. Therefore, we should see that games, while entertaining, can also provide a positive impact on children&#39;s all-round development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to tell you a fact: the AI ​​technology revolution that started to explode last year completely originated from games. The ChatGPT team, which is now leading the global AI revolution, also said in the interview that their development ideas come from games. More than ten years ago, I myself was an addicted gamer. Fighting monsters and leveling up is a very boring, hard and tiring job. Many of us looked at online guides and made a small program to automatically defeat monsters. From now on, in the game, when you hang up and sleep, you will automatically defeat monsters and level up. This can also be said to be a simplified version of AI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s more interesting is that according to Zhihu netizens: for at least 20 years after the birth of 3D graphics cards, 99% of graphics cards were dedicated to games, and 1% were used for movies and graphics. Gamers around the world have created a graphics card market worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and the stock of hundreds of millions of graphics cards has supported technological progress over the past few decades. Scientific computing such as AI is just a free ride after the game industry matures. It can be said that the outbreak of AI is just a by-product of the game industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This wave of AI technology revolution has had a profound impact on mankind. The prosperity of the game industry promoted the development of graphics cards and other technologies, providing the foundation for subsequent scientific computing and AI technologies. Although the development of AI originated from games, its applications have involved many fields such as medical care, education, and transportation, and have produced profound changes in human society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the immersive experience and interactive mechanisms brought by video games are also changing fields such as education and medical care. More and more educators are trying to use video games to increase students&#39; participation and motivation. In terms of medical rehabilitation, virtual simulation systems based on video games also show great application prospects. It can be said that electronic games are not only changing the way of entertainment, but will also profoundly affect all aspects of human society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, we cannot simply regard games as a negative form of entertainment, nor can we generally oppose children&#39;s participation in games. On the contrary, we should fully realize the positive aspects of games and guide children to develop various abilities in games. In this information age, games are not only a form of entertainment, but also a way of learning and innovation. Through games, children can learn important abilities such as teamwork, problem solving, and creative thinking, laying a solid foundation for future development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The younger generation has grown up in a video game environment. This new form of entertainment and competition is no different from traditional sports. To be fair, many traditional sports are not inferior to e-sports in terms of cultivating endurance, collaboration, and adaptability. We cannot simply characterize new things as &quot;curses&quot;, but should understand and accept video game culture with an open and inclusive mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, we cannot ignore the problems existing in games, such as addiction and over-consumption. How to guide and play the positive role of games is a topic worthy of further study. Parents and teachers need to guide their children to participate in games while also focusing on cultivating their good gaming habits and self-control abilities. Moderate gaming is good for children&#39;s physical and mental health, but overindulgence may have a negative impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, video games are not a curse, but a rich and colorful form of cultural expression and entertainment. We should look at games with an open mind. Through correct guidance, children who love games can not only find fun in games, but also cultivate various beneficial abilities and lay a solid foundation for future development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a college teacher in Zhejiang Province)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Modern architecture, located in the ancient village of Huangpu, Guangzhou. Visitors walking through the granite strips will enter the landscape space under the hard top of the mountain and the low straight ridge. An artist is painting on a long table, and on the wall is a large completed landscape. This is 68-year-old Luo Yiping, who has used this ancient ancestral hall as a studio for ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/1b19dc0539.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/1b19dc0539.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259849&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Luo Yiping&#39;s work &quot;Region·Non-Region (1)&quot;. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping has multiple identities. He is a painter, professor, critic and curator. He has taught at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Sun Yat-sen University. Later he served as the director of Guangdong Museum of Art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping is considered a rare &quot;scholar-type painter&quot; in the art world. In an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend in 2007, Luo Yiping, who teaches at Sun Yat-sen University, published a series of books called &quot;Images in Art History.&quot; &quot;Rather than reading their pictures, it is better to say that I am reading my own desires and will.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After many years, Luo Yiping remembers this discussion. It was his most important academic achievement at Sun Yat-sen University, and he interpreted thousands of Western paintings from his own perspective. Images in the history of contemporary art, as well as images of landscapes, figures, flowers and birds in the history of Chinese art. He said at the time: &quot;I don&#39;t think the essence of art is divided into East and West, but the expression tools of art are definitely different. This is not determined by personal subjective thoughts, but by differences in ethical habits and cognitive habits.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2020, Luo Yiping presided over the &quot;Art Creation Laws, Talent Growth Laws and Thousand Talents Research Plan&quot;, which was applied by the China Artists Association. To this end, he drafted a questionnaire to be distributed to members of the National Artists Association. As a result, he discovered something that worried him: the boundaries of artists now seem to be more &quot;firm&quot; than in the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;They will frame it with a symbol or image. This unintentionally creates a clear boundary between traditional ink and contemporary ink, each playing its own role.&quot; Luo Yiping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fan Di&#39;an, chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, said: &quot;At present, the biggest issue in the development of Chinese painting is how to look at the relationship between tradition and contemporary times.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping did not answer this question directly. He painted many new works. In November, Luo Yiping completed his most important solo exhibition in 2023, &quot;One Yuan Returns to the Beginning - Luo Yiping&#39;s Ink Works Exhibition&quot; hosted by the Guangdong Museum of Art and the Guangdong Artists Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/6aa87222e5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;784&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/6aa87222e5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259850&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Luo Yiping&#39;s work &quot;Jing·Not Jing (1)&quot;. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The exhibition consists of four parts: &quot;Mountain · Non-Mountain&quot;, &quot;Region · Non-Region&quot;, &quot;Jing · Non-Situation&quot; and &quot;Word · Non-Word&quot; The exhibition hall is composed of exhibition halls that display Luo Yiping&#39;s landscape works and boundary concepts in recent years. In Luo Yiping&#39;s works, Fan Di&#39;an said that he saw that boundaries are not constraints, but also provide the possibility of breakthrough. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The homogeneity of ink painting is too serious”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In May 2023, Luo Yiping created while listening to Tchaikovsky A large painting of 18 meters was made. It has been his habit for many years to pair classical music with large paintings. Music guides the painter&#39;s emotions, while large-scale landscapes test the painter&#39;s creative &quot;momentum&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What exactly is a landscape painting that is different from others? Over the past few decades, these works, ranging from large landscape paintings to landscape sketches, have not lacked appeal and literary interest, but they are still considered by critics to have the shadow of famous artists such as Huang Binhong, Pan Tianshou, and Lu Yanshao. Luo Yiping doesn&#39;t care about these external comments, but hopes to &quot;push open a door.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The paintings I have seen and the books I have read over the years flow into the eight-foot rice paper through the end of the pen. In the dense pen and ink, the traditional landscape &quot;disappears&quot; on Luo Yiping&#39;s scroll. &quot;Yes.&quot; This 18-meter-long scroll now hangs in the &quot;Mountain·Feishan&quot; exhibition hall. The image of the mountain appears faintly, but it is no longer so &quot;mountain-like&quot;. Luo Yiping uses an uncertain long and short lines and thick and light ink color blocks to show the atmosphere of the mountains, trying to draw the viewer into the painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The painting theory of the Tang and Song Dynasties required that Chinese paintings should be &quot;visible, feasible, travelable, and habitable.&quot; Luo Yiping pointed to the broken lines in his landscape, &quot;Is this mountain beautiful? I can&#39;t tell.&quot; &quot;Does this mountain have space for us to enter? No.&quot; &quot;Does this mountain have the cultural atmosphere of a gathering of literati in pavilions and pavilions? No. &quot;This mountain has only bare lines. Do you want to live here forever? It will definitely not attract interest.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Traditional ink painting has strict regulations. &quot;What opinion do I want to express in a Chinese painting? Is there a mountain in front or behind it? Should there be a pavilion on the mountain?&quot; These are settings.&quot; Likewise, this regulation affects the people who view the paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This time, the spatial image that is most valued in traditional landscapes has been &quot;lost&quot; by Luo Yiping. Viewers of the painting are never able to enter the mountains, and can no longer find familiar directions and specific spaces. In the end, they can only &quot;see with non-mountain eyes.&quot; This is exactly the effect Luo Yiping expected. People who look at paintings can see their own desires and wills, just like they did in the past. Among the horizontal and vertical thick and thin lines and thick and light ink dots, follow along and let your emotions blend into the mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/23b202d7ae.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;831&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/23b202d7ae.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259851&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Luo Yiping&#39;s work &quot;Mountain·Not Mountain (V)&quot;. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yin Shuangxi, deputy editor-in-chief of &quot;Art Research&quot; of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, once said: &quot;He is a scholar, and the paintings are not just about his theory. It also reflects his memory of landscape painting images. A painter’s possession of the feeling of pen and ink is always the most important.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping was born in Jiangxi. He started painting in elementary school, then went north to study and received a doctorate degree from the Art History Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Later he taught in Guangzhou for many years. For many years, he has always insisted on &quot;having nothing in mind&quot;, which means that there should be no settings and regulations in mind, and he should break away from fixed ideas and methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After this painting, many problems seemed to be solved at once. Luo Yiping told Southern Weekend reporters that in the past, there was a clear boundary between contemporary art and mainstream art: &quot;The boundary has a very strong restriction on the development of Chinese painting. Once it passes a little bit, it is not classified as Chinese painting because it crosses the boundary. This is Artificially setting up barriers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What Luo Yiping is worried about is that &quot;the homogenization of ink painting is too serious. If you learn from Huang Binhong, you will be Huang Binhong, and if you learn from Lu Yanshao, you will be Lu Yan Shao emphasizes foundation rather than development... Every ancient person actually has his own present. When every ancient person moves forward, the biggest issue he considers is the present.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping showed the questionnaire to Southern Weekend reporters. In the questionnaire, he asked more than 9,000 Chinese artists more than 600 questions, ranging from national ideology to the current development status of Chinese art to the artists&#39; personal family lives. Regarding the laws of art, the anxiety of faults, and the establishment of an evaluation system... On August 6, 2021, Luo Yiping decided to put everything aside for a short time and no longer consider these issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, he felt that there was nothing else in his mind, only the &quot;emotion&quot; that existed faintly. He wanted to pour out this emotion into his unforgettable works. This was how it was born. Luo Yiping found &quot;unprecedented passion&quot;: &quot;When you break through this boundary, you can gain greater freedom.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;There is an either-or barrier between traditional art and contemporary art. ”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In February 2010, Luo Yiping served as the director of the Guangdong Museum of Art. Two years later, at the Sixth Asian Art Museum Directors Forum, Luo Yiping once again felt some kind of discourse “pressure”. At the roundtable meeting, some art museum directors from East and South Asia suddenly &quot;attacked&quot; and hoped to cancel the forum later because &quot;the force that promotes the development of Asian art is not art museums, but curators.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As one of the participants at the time, Luo Yiping replied that he partially agreed with the curator’s opinion and decided to hold the first Asian Curated Exhibition in September 2013 The forum even proposed four sections of content. &quot;This is a temporary decision, including the time and topics of the forum,&quot; Luo Yiping told Southern Weekend reporters. &quot;I remember the scene was quiet.&quot; Luo Yiping then added that the forum would also invite directors and curators from the world&#39;s top museums People discussed &quot;Asian consciousness and Asian experience&quot; together, and the vote was passed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Soon, curators from important art museums including the Tate Modern in the UK, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the US, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, I received an invitation letter from China. This invitation lists the guests who will participate in the forum, although some people have not yet been invited. As a result, all the replies Luo Yiping received were &quot;participate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This was already ten years ago. Luo Yiping told Southern Weekend reporters that various opportunities have contributed to this largest curator forum in the world so far. Luo Yiping said that this is the first and currently only forum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping believes that the crisis faced by Chinese artists in the 21st century began in the late 20th century. Chinese artists suffered two impacts. One was the coercion of Western culture; Another is the change in the communication environment. &quot;For the outside world, mainly Asian contemporary art faces the European and American-centered art structure. Do we need to get rid of the Western system model and establish a new Asian artistic image? If so, how to achieve it?&quot; said the above-mentioned curator. At the forum, Luo Yiping said in a speech on the topic of &quot;Asian Consciousness and Asian Experience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Luo Yiping, who has retired, also prepared for the China Centenary Comics Exhibition held at the National Cartoon Museum of Belgium. At first, they encountered the familiar &quot;prejudice&quot; in Belgium, where the other party &quot;popularized&quot; comics, explained art and other basic content, but was unwilling to disclose the curatorial plan. In the subsequent long-term and powerful communication, the original &quot;assist in organizing the exhibition&quot; became &quot;leading in organizing the exhibition&quot;, and the plan to only show the &quot;revolutionary&quot; side of Chinese comics was replaced by a more comprehensive plan proposed by Luo Yiping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For many years, Luo Yiping has served as a visiting professor at the Repin Academy of Fine Arts in Russia, and has also been the chairman of the China Committee of the Asian Artists Alliance for 17 years. He told Southern Weekend reporters To put it bluntly: &quot;Chinese traditional landscape paintings have not received much attention in the world. The Japanese converted Chinese ink paintings into Japanese paintings during the Meiji Restoration era. When Europeans and Americans see Chinese paintings, they do not think they are Chinese paintings, but think they are Japanese paintings.&quot; Painting. Our traditional art has really little international influence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There is an either-or barrier between traditional art and contemporary art.&quot; After completing the 1.7 million-word project report, Luo Yiping realized that one of the core issues in Chinese painting is &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;cultural definition&quot;, which &quot;restricts the possibility of Chinese artists looking at art from a more comprehensive perspective.&quot; Sexuality has caused Chinese artists to be unable to deny themselves like Picasso and Matisse, Western artists in the 20th century, and lack a more tolerant and forward-looking vision.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping told Southern Weekend reporters that Chinese painters can of course &quot;put traditional language into a contemporary context to speak.&quot; In the work &quot;Region · Non-Region&quot; in Hall 2, Luo Yiping breaks the traditional ink landscape pattern and uses traditional brush and ink to organize the space, frame, and structure common in contemporary art works. In order to get closer to contemporary patterns, he added &quot;color&quot; to black and white ink to express the postmodern sense of &quot;absurd dislocation&quot;. In some works, Luo Yiping added elements of Western artists&#39; works to the ink that was originally a traditional landscape, realizing the &quot;juxtaposition&quot; of traditional ink and contemporary art, and also used contemporary painting materials to integrate them into the ink. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Hall 3, &quot;Jing·Feijing&quot;, Luo Yiping also brought installation art, with huge paintings reflected in the pillar mirrors. In Hall 4, &quot;Words and Non-Words&quot;, Luo Yiping uses 38 circular landscape paintings, tracing the ancient - imitating the ancient - literati taste - sketching - semi-abstract - abstract, recreating the path of ink painting from tradition to contemporary, without confrontation and Not a compromise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/44292696a2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/44292696a2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259852&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Some works from Luo Yiping&#39;s &quot;Yan Feiyan&quot;. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These works may appear to be Chinese paintings at first glance, but they are full of contemporary atmosphere and feeling. During the curatorial period, after seeing the exhibition, German-Chinese artist Ren Rong believed that Luo Yiping&#39;s works were &quot;the purest contemporary art, and it is non-Western, breaking the traditional landscape space.&quot; None of the more harsh critics deny that Luo Yiping&#39;s works are ink paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past, Luo Yiping mentioned in an interview with Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;What does the author want to do? Isn&#39;t it to ingrain the system of signifiers and signifiers that is deeply ingrained in the readers&#39; minds?&quot; Tear them apart one by one?&quot; Sixteen years later, his works once again &quot;seduce&quot; and &quot;tear apart&quot; the self-imposed barriers of Chinese painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[曹保平：我并不迷恋愤怒]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261458]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[小区电梯放露骨广告背后：业主自治权难落实丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261479]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the &quot;Xiaoxiang Morning News&quot; report, a citizen in Changsha reported that the elevator in their residential complex was covered with stickers on three sides. The &quot;home massage&quot; advertisement, the advertising images and slogans are very &quot;explicit&quot; and uncomfortable. It also arouses the curiosity of children and worries the owners. After the owners complained, the property management company removed two advertisements. The remaining advertisement looked relatively normal, but after scanning the QR code on the advertisement, there were still pages featuring a large number of sexy &quot;physical therapists.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding these marginal advertisements, staff from the property management company said that if the owner feels there is something wrong with the advertisement, he needs to provide evidence that it is an illegal advertisement. Whether it is illegal or not is up to the government. This incident quickly aroused heated discussion, which made people think: Is it true that any advertisement can be placed as long as it does not violate regulations? Do the owners have a say in what advertisements are placed in the community? Furthermore, who does community advertising revenue belong to? How should it be allocated? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These issues are actually very clear in law. Article 271 of the Civil Code stipulates that owners “enjoy the right to co-own and jointly manage the common parts other than the exclusive parts” of the building. The &quot;Property Management Regulations&quot; also stipulate that owners have the right to know and supervise the use of shared parts of the property, shared facilities and equipment, and related sites. Elevators, public activity venues, etc. are all shared by the owners of the community. In some communities, parking lots are built using roads, sites, etc. shared by the owners, and are also owned by the owners. Since these common parts are shared by the owners, the owners should naturally have the right to decide how to use them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to legal provisions, whether public locations such as elevators in a community can be used for advertising is a matter decided jointly by the owners and requires a vote by the owners. If the owners vote to place advertisements, they can also authorize the property management company to carry out specific operations. After all, it is unlikely that the owners will vote on whether every advertisement can be placed. However, even if the property management company is authorized to operate advertising spaces, it cannot do whatever it wants. When deciding what advertisements are acceptable, the views and feelings of the owners should be taken into consideration. Advertisements that the majority of owners think are inappropriate should be removed as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After solving the problem of whether it can operate, the next step is who owns the operating income and how to distribute and use it. In some communities, the owners&#39; shared portions are used for operations, and the income gained is considerable. &quot;Qianjiang Evening News&quot; once reported that a community with 15 residential buildings in Hangzhou has an annual operating income of about 1 million yuan, and some communities have an annual income of more than 4 million yuan. Advertisements in elevators, entrances, garages, etc. are an important source of income for the community. In addition, there are parking fees, business rent, venue rent, etc. Express lockers, self-service vending machines, etc. in the community need to pay rent. Some communities even charge entrance fees for telecom operators to set up base stations in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These operating income should naturally belong to the owners. According to the provisions of the property management regulations, these operating income should be mainly used to supplement special maintenance funds, and can also be used according to the decision of the owners&#39; meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in reality, many property companies often forget that they are only entrusted by the owners to provide property services, and instead regard themselves as the managers of the community. Many property companies arbitrarily add business projects in public places of communities or increase charging standards without consulting the owners. Some time ago, property companies in many residential areas in Nanjing installed electronic billboards in elevators without the consent of the owners. Previously, some residential properties added express delivery cabinets, takeout cabinets, etc. without the consent of the owners. Disputes caused by property management companies arbitrarily increasing parking fees in residential areas occur from time to time in various places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to not respecting the rights of owners on whether and how to operate the jointly owned parts, the actual operating income of many communities is also unclear. Some property companies announce operating income every year, but they only announce a total amount, which is divided into several major items such as parking fees and advertising space rentals. As for the details of each income, they are rarely announced, and of course few owners study it in detail. This leaves a lot of room for the property management company to operate. Some property companies rent out business buildings shared by owners in the community to their affiliated companies at low prices. The affiliated companies do not even charge for advertising in the community, but for unrelated companies, the charges are even higher than the market price. More importantly, some of the income may go directly into the pockets of the property management company, rather than being used as public operating income for the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The root cause of the constant disputes over community property management is that the property management company oversteps its authority and regards itself as the owner of the community and the manager of the owners. The fundamental solution to the problem lies in implementing the autonomy of community owners and allowing them to truly have the right to choose property management companies. Only then can property management companies truly change their roles and become service providers to all property owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[财富管理榜：29家最活跃金融机构，谁更用心看护您的财富？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261448]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wealth management is one of the core businesses of the global financial industry. It is one of the blue ocean markets where financial institutions are increasing competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Calculated in terms of personal financial assets, China has become the world&#39;s second largest wealth management market. As of the end of 2022, the scale of my country&#39;s wealth management market has reached 118.49 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 8.7%. Among them, the total scale of bank financial management and insurance asset management accounts for nearly 62%. At the same time, the huge potential of the wealth management market has attracted financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the wealth management market heats up and competition intensifies, regulatory agencies have issued new regulations one after another. In particular, the central bank, together with relevant departments, issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Regulating the Asset Management Business of Financial Institutions&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;commonly known as the &quot;New Asset Management Regulations&quot;&lt;/ span>;) is continuing to reshape the asset management market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The wealth management business in 2023 will not be easy. The lack of high-quality assets, the turmoil in the financial target market, and residents&#39; financial management deposits and regular deposits are all testing banks and insurance companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to select evaluation objects? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Under the huge market temptation, increasingly strict supervision and unfavorable market environment, the competition between my country&#39;s commercial banks and insurance institutions in wealth management in 2023 How is the strength? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, the People&#39;s Bank of China announced the list of domestic systemically important banks. The People&#39;s Bank of China mainly evaluates and identifies systemically important banks from four dimensions: size, relevance, substitutability and complexity. Rated commercial banks are divided into different groups based on their scores. In addition to meeting minimum capital requirements, reserve capital and countercyclical capital requirements, banks in each group should also meet different additional capital requirements. Among them, core tier-one capital has the strongest loss-absorbing capacity and is the core indicator for measuring the comprehensive strength and risk compensation capabilities of commercial banks. It is also an important foundation for the operation and development of the banking industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to statistics from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center, as of the end of June 2023, the total assets of the 20 systemically important banks reached 260 trillion yuan, accounting for the total assets of my country&#39;s commercial banks. About 3/4 of the assets; in the first half of 2023, a total net profit of 1.04 trillion was achieved, accounting for approximately 83% of the total net profit of my country’s commercial banks in the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center evaluates the 20 most representative domestic systemically important banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also included nine major life insurance companies in the list for evaluation. The total original insurance premium income of the nine companies from January to October 2023 is approximately 1.8 trillion yuan, accounting for approximately 3/4 of the total original insurance premium income of the life insurance industry during the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the main force in the wealth management market, how do commercial banks and insurance institutions seize the high ground? Can you provide high-quality wealth management products and services? To this end, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has constructed a wealth management index system to comprehensively evaluate the wealth management competitiveness of financial institutions in the banking and insurance industries. The results of the &quot;Wealth Management Ranking&quot; are intended to provide investors with a decision-making reference and provide useful reference for financial institutions to improve their competitiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bank list: Six dimensions&amp;nbsp;Eighteen sub-indicators&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the wealth management business of twenty commercial banks, Southern Weekend The New Finance Research Center conducts a combined qualitative and quantitative assessment from six dimensions, and assigns appropriate weights to eighteen sub-indicators. The total weight of these qualitative and quantitative indicators is 70%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center team assigned media factor weights based on special research on the above-mentioned institutions, and invited an external expert jury to evaluate the above-mentioned companies. Conduct a review. Both scoring weights are 15% each. Among them, the media factor mainly refers to the openness and transparency of the financial institutions under investigation to media research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wealth Management Ranking Bank Ranking Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /28/67cc569e2b.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2529&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/67cc569e2b.png &quot; data-key=&quot;259835&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wealth Management Ranking Bank Ranking Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The above main dimensions are now &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;analyzed&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;and explained&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;(1)&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Wealth management scale&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;and capability&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; : Maximum weight&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;s. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are 8 secondary indicators under wealth management scale and capability, with a total weight of 35%, accounting for half of the weight of all qualitative and quantitative indicators. Therefore, this dimension is the most important consideration in measuring the competitiveness of commercial banks’ wealth management. Among them, as the basis and prerequisite for carrying out wealth management business, there are five indicators related to the retail business of commercial banks, including: retail customer scale, personal deposit balance and its growth rate, total assets under management of retail customers and its growth rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, in order to gain insight into the profitability of the wealth management business of commercial banks, the fee and commission income generated by related businesses and their growth rate are also important measurement indicators. However, given that my country&#39;s wealth management market has not formed unified regulations for the wide range of businesses included in wealth management, and various commercial banks have inconsistent definitions of wealth management fees and commissions, this list uses the quantitative indicators of each bank&#39;s net fee and commission income and Whether to publish qualitative indicators of data related to wealth management business income to roughly assess the bank&#39;s wealth management profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To sum up, the scale of wealth management embodies the basic scale, competitiveness and profitability of commercial banks’ wealth management business, and is the most important dimension to measure the level of wealth management. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;(2)&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The scale of financial management business: embodies the &quot;two strengths&quot; of financial management products&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are 4 secondary indicators under the scale dimension of financial management business, with a total weight of 16%. Since the &quot;New Asset Management Regulations&quot; were officially implemented in 2022, major commercial banks have basically completed the net-value transformation of their wealth management business, and have established wealth management subsidiaries to undertake the design, development and operation of their wealth management products. Wealth management subsidiaries have thus become the core pillar of wealth management for commercial banks. This list uses four indicators, including the issuance scale and growth rate of wealth management products, net profit of wealth management subsidiaries and its growth rate, to consider the strength of each commercial bank&#39;s wealth management business, and also reflects the market competitiveness of each bank&#39;s wealth management products after the wealth management market is standardized. and the risk-resistance ability of wealth management products after the net-worth transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;(3)&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Private banking business: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Tinjian’s comprehensive service capabilities&lt;/strong >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are three secondary indicators under the private banking business dimension, with a total weight of 12%. In order to attract high-net-worth customers, each bank has deployed private banking business, strengthened the construction of comprehensive private banking services, and enhanced the core competitive advantages of private banking business. This list uses three indicators: the number of private banking customers, the scale of private banking customer assets under management and its growth rate to measure the competitiveness of each bank&#39;s private banking business, thereby demonstrating the comprehensive service capabilities and level of each bank at the top of the pyramid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;(4)&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Wealth service capabilities: consider professionalism and initiative&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are three secondary indicators under the wealth service capability dimension, with a total weight of 7%. Different from the above-mentioned wealth management scale and wealth management business capabilities, wealth service capabilities mainly consider the professionalism of commercial banks&#39; wealth management business and their &quot;customer-centered&quot; proactive service awareness and capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the one hand, commercial banks should promptly explain the fluctuations in wealth management and financial management business income, continue to accompany customers and maintain high-level service capabilities; on the other hand, Commercial banks should attach great importance to the construction of wealth management teams, establish a wealth management talent training system, regularly organize various trainings, continuously improve the professional knowledge and service levels of financial management practitioners, and enhance the professionalism of wealth management business from both the company and client sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Who wins the bank ranking? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The bank list of the 2023 wealth management list shows that Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Merchants Bank and Agricultural Bank of China occupy the top three. With its comprehensive capabilities and comprehensive strength in wealth management, ICBC ranked first with a total score of 77.40. China Merchants Bank relied on its leading edge in private banking to overtake state-owned banks and rank second on the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wealth Management Ranking Bank Ranking (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28 /d67de23e50.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2237&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/d67de23e50.png&quot; data -key=&quot;259836&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wealth Management Ranking Bank Ranking (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Observed by bank type, among the four major state-owned banks, the wealth management business of the four major industrial and agricultural banks, China Construction Bank, has strong economies of scale advantages and ranks high overall. Specifically, ICBC ranks first in wealth management scale, net fee and commission income, and overall ranking first; Agricultural Bank of China ranks among the top three in the list because it has the largest retail customer scale, personal deposit scale, and wealth management product scale; China Although the bank leads among the four major banks in terms of the growth rate of personal deposit balances and the growth rate of net fees and commissions, its number of retail customers and its efforts in financial investor education, professional talent team building, and the popularization of financial knowledge are China Construction Bank lost a lot of points due to lack of information disclosure, and finally ranked seventh; China Construction Bank&#39;s wealth management scale and financial business scale are comparable to ICBC, but the scale growth rate and net profit performance of its financial business have become its biggest loss points.

The market conditions have had an impact on the overall bank financial management business. In the first half of 2023, although the growth rate of wealth management scale of China Merchants Bank was negative, it ranked first among joint-stock banks and ranked second overall because its wealth management scale and private banking business performed much better than other joint-stock banks; Ping An Bank&#39;s wealth management scale ranked second among Ranked third among joint-stock banks, ranked first in net profit growth rate of wealth management subsidiaries, ranked first in growth rate of total assets under management of private banks, and disclosed the most complete and detailed information related to wealth management.

Therefore, it ranks first among city commercial banks and has also been promoted to the comprehensive ranking. Fifth; Bank of Beijing and Minsheng Bank did not fully disclose information related to wealth management, and many key indicator data were not disclosed in the 2023 interim report, which seriously affected their scores and rankings, so they were at the bottom of the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dimension analysis, wealth management scale and capability dimensions embody the basic scale, competitiveness and profitability of commercial banks&#39; wealth management business. Overall, state-owned banks have a relatively large base in wealth management business, strong ability to attract personal deposits, and excellent profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The scale dimension of financial management business highlights the competitiveness of financial management products of various banks after the financial management market is standardized, and the risk resistance ability of financial management products after the net-worth transformation. Overall, joint-stock banks and city commercial banks perform well in terms of scale of financial management business. Some leaders are no smaller than state-owned banks and have good growth rates, highlighting the opportunities for latecomers to overtake in new business areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The private banking business dimension further reflects the capabilities and level of each bank in high-end wealth management services. Generally speaking, state-owned banks have a large private banking customer base and a large scale of managed private banking customer assets, and the private banking business of city commercial banks is also gradually speeding up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The wealth service capability dimension presents the professionalism and &quot;customer-centered&quot; initiative of commercial banks&#39; wealth management business.

There are 8 secondary indicators under the channel construction capability dimension, with a total weight of 40%. The construction of various channels is the basic ability of life insurance companies to engage in wealth management business and even the entire life insurance business, and it is also the most important influencing factor. Most of the life insurance companies evaluated have large agent teams and various distribution channels. They have strong sales capabilities and can reach a large number of customer groups, which helps attract customer groups to participate in wealth management business and increase the wealth management customer base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to more accurately consider the comprehensive strength of the nine life insurance companies in channel construction, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center team evaluated individual insurance agent channels and bancassurance channels respectively. Quantitative indicators such as the channel’s premium income, new business value, and 13-month and 25-month premium/policy continuation rates are supplemented by qualitative evaluations of distribution channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(2) Wealth management scale and capabilities. There are five secondary indicators under this dimension, with a total weight of 25%. Life insurance companies support the development of insurance liability business through wealth management business. Therefore, the scale of assets managed and invested by life insurance companies and their rate of return have become two important dimensions for measuring the wealth management strength of insurance companies. This list uses indicators such as third-party asset management scale, investment asset scale, total investment income and rate of return as quantitative indicators of the competitiveness of the wealth management business of the nine life insurance companies, and the adequacy of wealth management-related information disclosure as the nine life insurance companies. A qualitative indicator of the importance a company places on its wealth management business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(3) Business collaboration capabilities. Major life insurance companies attach great importance to business synergy, which is also an important starting point for strengthening the competitive advantages of related products and services. As competition in the wealth management market becomes increasingly fierce, life insurance companies can build their own &quot;ecosystem&quot; through multi-business collaboration and form a &quot;moat.&quot; Therefore, this list specifically considers the measures and achievements of nine life insurance companies in building ecosystems such as comprehensive health and comprehensive pension, and encourages insurance companies to provide differentiated services to customers through the &quot;insurance + service&quot; model, thereby highlighting relevant life insurance companies comparative advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why does the champion not dominate the rankings in one indicator? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The life insurance list of the 2023 wealth management list shows that Ping An Life, China Life and Taiping Life are among the top three. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the fourteen secondary indicators in the life insurance rankings, Ping An Life is not particularly conspicuous, only in the adequacy of information disclosure and the &quot;insurance + service&quot; model. It received the highest score among the two secondary indicators of category, and none of the other 12 quantitative indicators ranked first. However, in-depth analysis found that most of Ping An Life&#39;s indicators performed at the mid-to-upper level, with very few indicators clearly lagging behind. Specifically, among the twelve quantitative indicators, Ping An Life ranks second in five and third in four. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although China Life is the &quot;king&quot; in premiums in the life insurance industry, it implements more stringent statistics in the two key indicators that reflect the renewal rate. In terms of information disclosure and information disclosure, its scores on related indicators lagged behind those of its peers, dragging down its overall score and ultimately ranking second with a gap of 1.6 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taiping Life ranks first in two indicators: third-party asset management scale and 25-month premium/policy continuation rate, but its total investment return rate The two indicators of new business value and bancassurance channel lag behind peers, dragging down the overall ranking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wealth Management Ranking - Life Insurance Ranking (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28 /75a5eb9098.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1188&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/75a5eb9098.png&quot; data -key=&quot;259838&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wealth Management List Life Insurance List (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the perspective of wealth management scale and capabilities, the larger the asset management scale, the higher the investment business returns, the stronger the ability to allocate large-scale assets, and the stronger the wealth management retail business will be. China Life and Ping An Life have obvious advantages in this indicator, with investment assets and total investment income significantly ahead of other life insurance companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the perspective of channel construction capabilities, China Life’s number of agents in the individual insurance channel, premium income from the bancassurance channel, premium income from the individual insurance channel, and new innovations from the individual insurance channel All four indicators of business value ranked first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The business synergy dimension score shows that each of the nine life insurance companies has its own characteristics. For example, Sunshine Life focuses on the four core needs of family customers such as health care, pension planning, children&#39;s education and wealth management, and concentrates resources to create a multi-level &quot;insurance + service&quot; ecological service system covering the entire family life cycle; Taikang Life Insurance has cooperated with Taikang The layout of the early and high-density high-end retirement communities has formed a positive interaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The list also shows that the life insurance industry will continue to bottom out in 2022. Against the background of lower bank deposit interest rates, bank financial losses, and increased volatility in equity products such as stocks, life insurance products with higher interest rates have been highly sought after for more than half a year, and even experienced a pulse peak effect for a time. However, the rebound momentum is affected by various internal and external factors, and the overall performance throughout the year is unsatisfactory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Especially with the reduction of interest rates in the second half of the year and the implementation of the regulatory authorities&#39; &quot;unification of reporting and banking&quot; regulations, (for details, see Southern Weekend&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.infzm.com/contents/259167&quot;>;How come the bancassurance business is deformed all year round when there are large accounts and small accounts?&lt;/a>;》) The competitiveness of product rates has decreased and the handling fees of bancassurance channels have dropped significantly. . The once hot-selling scene of life insurance products has returned to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth mentioning that the bancassurance channel is one of the important channels for many life insurance companies.

There are no transfers or stops during transportation. For this type of international air transport incident, the main international treaties to refer to for the attribution of civil jurisdiction are the &quot;Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Air Transport&quot; formulated in 1929 and the &quot;Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Air Transport&quot; formulated in 1999 Convention (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the Montreal Convention&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, the latter sets the compensation standards for civil aviation accidents and has the effect of priority application.

One is a claim against Malaysia Airlines and insurance companies based on the Montreal Convention, and the other is a claim against the aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The company filed a product liability lawsuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hao Junbo, a lawyer who has represented the families of an air crash in transnational litigation, told Southern Weekend reporters that the United States has the highest air crash compensation standards in the world, so worldwide, If an air crash occurs in almost any country, as long as the plane has a connection point with the United States, such as an engine or parts manufactured by an American company, attorneys from various countries will strive to prosecute the case in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Senior international aviation lawyer James Healy-Pratt wrote in 2021 that based on the jury’s recognition of unlimited compensation for bereavement, etc. Considering all these factors, the average amount of compensation awarded by American courts for air crash victims is the highest in the world, reaching US$5.2 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, Hao Junbo said: &quot;In recent years, the possibility of foreign air crashes being tried by U.S. courts is very low, and they are generally dismissed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2018, the judge of multidistrict litigation in the United States ruled as forum non conveniens (&lt;em>;forum non conveniens&lt;/em>;) (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The principle of forum non conveniens means that after a court accepts a foreign-related case, it considers the many inconvenient factors in the trial of the case and believes that it is more convenient for the court to hear the case in other jurisdictions, so it gives up the case. The court dismissed all lawsuits arising from the disappearance of MH370 on the grounds of jurisdiction (&lt;/span>;), and the court believed that Malaysian courts were more suitable to hear these cases. The family chose to appeal, and in 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the original verdict and dismissed all the family&#39;s lawsuits in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In March 2017, 15 Chinese family members sued the Malaysian government, the Malaysian military and the Malaysian Civil Aviation Authority for &quot;negligence&quot; in Malaysia, demanding disclosure. the truth. In 2018, a Malaysian court ruled against the family due to insufficient evidence. In addition, from 2016 to 2020, the cases brought by family members against Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government in Malaysia were also lost due to insufficient evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The trial will not be affected by the outcome of foreign litigation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The domestic litigation of the MH370 case can be traced back to 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia announced in 2015 that Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 crashed and it was presumed that all people on board were killed, Malaysia Airlines subsequently announced a compensation of 2.52 million to the families of each MH370 crash passenger. Yuan Yuan, but asked the family to give up pursuing responsibility against the Malaysian government, Malaysia Airlines, Malaysian military, and Boeing Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, nearly two-thirds of the families refused to sign the settlement agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2016, some family members who did not sign the agreement went to the Beijing Railway Transport Court to sue Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airlines International Berhad, Boeing Company, and Rolls-Rolls— Royce Holdings plc, Allianz Insurance Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In March 2016, the Beijing Railway Transport Court announced that it had filed and accepted 36 civil claims for compensation from passengers involved in the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. At the end of 2017, the Beijing Railway Transport Court held a pre-trial meeting on the case, which was later designated by the Beijing High Court to be under the jurisdiction of the Beijing Chaoyang District Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2020, almost all family members who lost cases abroad returned to Chinese courts to sue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Qihuai, a lawyer representing some of the family members, said in a previous interview that for more than nine years, the court has actively promoted reconciliation between the two parties, and the family members and Malaysia Airlines and insurance companies have More than half of the cases are waiting for the parties involved to reconcile. As of March 2021, 89 families have refused to settle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Previously, the lawsuits filed by the families of Chinese passengers involved in the crash were not supported by the courts in the United States and Malaysia. Will this result affect domestic litigation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the relevant provisions of the judicial interpretation of the Civil Procedure Law, for cases where both Chinese and foreign courts have jurisdiction, one party will file a lawsuit in the foreign court, while the other party will file a lawsuit in the foreign court. If a lawsuit is filed in a Chinese court, the domestic court may accept the case. After the judgment, if a foreign court applies or the parties request a domestic court to recognize and enforce the judgment or ruling made by a foreign court on the case, it will not be allowed, unless otherwise provided for in an international treaty jointly concluded or acceded to by both parties. In addition, if a foreign court&#39;s judgment or ruling has been recognized by a domestic court, and the party files a lawsuit in a domestic court with the same dispute, it will not be accepted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;An unnamed civil procedure law scholar told Southern Weekend reporters that generally speaking, even if a civil case is successful in a foreign country, the effective judgment must be made in If you apply for execution domestically, you should first apply to the domestic intermediate court with jurisdiction for recognition and execution. After passing the review, the court will rule to recognize its validity and issue an execution order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For civil cases that are lost abroad, first of all, there is no need to apply for enforcement. Secondly, as long as there are no special provisions, the parties can still sue domestically based on the same facts and causes of action. &quot;The aforementioned scholar told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although China and Malaysia have signed a bilateral judicial assistance treaty, namely the Treaty between the Government of the People&#39;s Republic of China and the Government of Malaysia on Criminal Judicial Assistance, the bilateral treaty stipulates that The content covers criminal cases and does not take into account judicial decisions on civil disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This means that the results of previous lawsuits filed abroad by the families of MH370 passengers will not affect the Chinese court&#39;s hearing of the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to CCTV news reports, the amount of civil compensation filed by the passengers’ families is between 10 million and 80 million yuan. Because each family’s situation is different, the amount is also different. , a large part of the compensation costs is mental damage solatium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[明月与乌皮靴：探寻“光影世界”之外的李白]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261450]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/28/a8b47c1659.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 28/a8b47c1659.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259841&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The bright moon is a classic image in Li Bai&#39;s poems.

The white clouds will disperse on their own, and who will the bright moon fall on?&quot; Xie An&#39;s seclusion in Dongshan after his achievements made Li Bai fall in love, and &quot;Ming Yue&quot; became the embodiment of the ideal that Li Bai pursued throughout his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Two years before his death, Li Bai met a Shu monk in Jiangxia, who was about to go to Chang&#39;an. Li Bai wrote, &quot;The moon of Mount Emei returns to you, and the wind blows west to Chang&#39;an.

Li Bai took the opportunity to visit him on the way with his poems. Su Ting admired the young man in front of him very much, and said to his staff: &quot;This young scholar has outstanding talent, and his writing style is like a flowing river. Although his current writing is not strong enough, he already has a unique style. If he continues to grow His knowledge will definitely be comparable to that of Sima Xiangru in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Perhaps Li Bai did not expect that this was already the most glorious visit in his life.

One voice thinks that Li Bai disdains to participate, while the other is that Li Bai cannot participate. &lt;p>; qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Contemporary scholars such as Professor Lang Baoru of Inner Mongolia University interpret that even if it is not a &quot;family of industry and commerce&quot;, Li Bai&#39;s family &quot;hidden back to Guanghan in the early days of Shenlong&quot; and was not in the Ministry of Household Affairs Registration, no genealogy. Xiang Gong needs to provide documents that can prove his family background and identity, such as household registration and genealogy, for review by the Ministry of Household Affairs. People with &quot;unknown origins&quot; like Li Bai were naturally not eligible to be selected as tribute candidates by prefectures and counties and take part in the imperial examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai can only realize his ambition through other means. &quot;Roaming in the mountains and rivers, living in seclusion to study Taoism, making friends with Taoist priests, paying homage to local governors and ministers of the government and the public, all with the purpose of raising one&#39;s worth and creating a sensational effect in becoming famous in the capital and the emperor, and only then was Tianbao summoned to the capital.&quot; Chongqing Xiong Du, a professor at Technology and Business University, said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taoism was respected in the Tang Dynasty, and the royal family regarded Laozi and Li Er as their ancestors. During the Xuanzong period, respect for Laozi and Taoism reached its peak. From the emperor to his relatives, nobles and bureaucrats, everyone believed in Taoism. Xuanzong&#39;s two younger sisters, Princess Jinxian and Princess Yuzhen, simply became female Taoists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the age of 5, Li Bai lived in Changlong County, Mianzhou, central Sichuan (now Jiangyou City, Sichuan Province) for 19 years. As the birthplace of the Five Pecks of Rice Taoism, Shu Taoism is very popular and there are caves and heavens all over it. According to legend, Zhang Daoling, the founder of the sect, once lived in seclusion in Heming Mountain and preached in Qingcheng Mountain. There is still a Jinguang Cave in Qianyuan Mountain in Jiangyou, which is said to be the place where Nezha became a disciple and practiced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai was immersed in the atmosphere of Taoism. He visited famous Taoist mountains such as Mount Emei, Daitian Mountain, and Ziyun Mountain, and made many unique friends. He once lived in seclusion in the south of Minshan Mountain with Dong Yanzi, raised many birds, and learned the art of calling birds to his palm. Yuan Danqiu later became his best Taoist friend throughout his life, and invited him to visit Taoism in Songshan Mountain several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I have traveled to the gods for fifteen years, and they have never stopped traveling. ... The jade boy in Xishan made me refine gold bones.&quot; &quot;Alchemy bones&quot; means refining elixirs. It seems that Li Bai was deeply influenced by Taoism at the age of fifteen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In traditional Chinese philosophy, Taoism is the philosophical category with the deepest exploration of the universe.&quot; Both Ding Ying and her father had an indissoluble bond with Li Bai. The father and daughter successively served as the director of the Li Bai Memorial Hall. She analyzed to the Southern Weekend reporter that Li Bai and Su Shi were both from Sichuan, and their poems were full of elegant and romantic atmosphere. &quot;We are in a basin, and it is difficult to get out. The only exit is the sky. Sichuan people have developed the habit of using their own brains to make up for the reality, so they all have magnificent imaginations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Modern people are no longer sure of the specific locations of the fairy mountains in Li Bai&#39;s works, but they may as well pay tribute and commemorate his enthusiasm. Today, there are more than 20 scenic spots in Jiangyou related to Li Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/bbdf37ed70.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/bbdf37ed70.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259845&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The statue of young Li Bai in front of Longfeng Hall.

He mentioned to Southern Weekend reporters that in the past, when worship was still allowed, before the Mid-Autumn Festival every year, Guangdong businessmen would often come to the ancestral hall with their families and ask Taoist priests to perform rituals for three days. &quot;Li Bai likes the moon.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai never left Taoism throughout his life. However, there were many motivations for learning Taoism. Taoism&#39;s pursuit of freedom and eternity in individual life is exactly in line with Li Bai&#39;s pursuit of a spiritual state of indulgence and freedom. When he was politically frustrated, Li Bai often turned to mountains and rivers and wandering immortals. Taoism undoubtedly gave him spiritual comfort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The subtle relationship between studying Taoism and seeking official positions is much more secret. While the Tang Dynasty implemented the imperial examination system, it also recruited secluded wise men from time to time, asking them about political affairs, or asking them to come out to assist the king. Many of these people were Taoists. Xiong Du discovered that, compared with the strict scrutiny of family background in the imperial examination, talents specially ordered by the emperor could escape this rule. For example, Taoist figures such as Zhang Guo and Ye Fashan, who were rumored to have the secret of immortality, were recruited by the emperor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also speculated that the reason why Li Bai is good at immortal Taoism may be related to this, &quot;It is to create for Xuanzong that he not only has the talent of Wang Zuo, but also a You really have the impression of being an &#39;immortal&#39; with an &#39;immortal spirit&#39;, so that you can avoid the trouble of tracing your family background and place of origin when you join the officialdom.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The spirit of taking off your boots is still in your sleeves&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Night shrouds Xi&#39;an, and the lights of the &quot;Datang Everlasting City&quot; commercial street at the foot of the Big Wild Goose Pagoda come on. &quot;Prosperity of the Tang Dynasty&quot; performances are being performed all over the street.

Every night, this NPC (non-player character) will come here to exchange poems with tourists, &quot;Everyone, come and listen to this one again, the most difficult one among Taibai&#39;s poems.&quot; What he throws out is &quot;Thoughts on a Quiet Night.&quot; There is also a &quot;Li Bai&quot; in Xi&#39;an. In the &quot;Twelve Hours of Chang&#39;an&quot; theme district, a certain liquor company has built a Taibai wine shop. He holds a wine bowl and invites tourists sitting at the table to drink with him while reciting &quot;The wine will come in&quot;. 》. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the Datang West Market Museum, a middle-aged lady who came with a group from Anhui told a Southern Weekend reporter that she observed that people traveling to Xi&#39;an pay attention to &quot; The most popular ones are the Terracotta Warriors and Horses, and the current recommendation is Li Yang’s Love.” Her tour guide, Xiao Liu, a native of Xi&#39;an, talked about Li Bai twice in the museum, &quot;casually&quot;. He admitted that he didn&#39;t know Li Bai at all before working, and he had relatively little contact with him after working. Except for a few tourists who like history, most of them People are similar to themselves, &quot;After watching &quot;Thirty Thousand Miles from Chang&#39;an&quot;, I understand a little bit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Li Bai actually did not have a fixed residence in the Tang Dynasty. He neither bought a house, nor was it found in relevant documents that he rented it. So like Bai Juyi, as his official position rose, his residence was from the south of the city to the imperial city, so the status level determines the level of wealth.&quot; Mao Jingru, education specialist of Xi&#39;an Museum, told Southern Weekend reporters that in history, &quot;Chang&#39;an It is not a place where he (Li Bai) has lived for a long time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the autumn of 742, Li Bai received Xuanzong&#39;s order to enter Chang&#39;an. During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, some northern Hu people&#39;s clothing became popular in society, including the &quot;black leather Liuhe boots&quot; worn by the Hu people. Later, the official officially designated it as the standard wear for officials, which is quite similar to the black leather shoes commonly worn in modern formal occasions. When he first arrived in Chang&#39;an, Li Bai was still wearing the white linen clothes that symbolized the common people. This time, he changed into a round-neck robe and black leather boots and entered the capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai wrote &quot;Nanling Farewell Children Entering Beijing&quot; before leaving, &quot;It is not early to persuade the children to endure the hardships, and ride the whip on the horse for the long journey. ... Looking up to the sky and laughing out loud &quot;How can I be a Penghao person?&quot; Years of depression were relieved, and the ideal of displaying talents and strategies was given the opportunity to be realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, he had the ambition of &quot;lobbying thousands of people&quot;, and the position he was awarded was Hanlin enshrinement, or Hanlin waiting for the imperial edict. Unlike Hanlin scholars who are in charge of edicts and participate in political affairs, Hanlin ministers are a group of professionals in various fields who stay by the emperor&#39;s side to serve him. They had the opportunity to have real positions after being favored by the emperor. For example, Wang Shuwen, who was good at playing chess, and Wang Qian, who was proficient in calligraphy, waited for the imperial edict, were appreciated by Dezong, and served as attendant readers and calligraphers, and were promoted step by step. However, Li Bai entered the Imperial Academy with poetry and prose as his skills, and he always stayed in the position of a literary attendant and never entered the formal bureaucratic ranks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As time passed, Li Bai, who was living in the Hanlin Academy, found that his political ideals were becoming disillusioned. &quot;It&#39;s easy for blue flies to get together, but it&#39;s hard for white snow to harmonize with each other. It&#39;s meant to be dispersed,&quot; he said. People have repeatedly criticized others and promoted criticism.&quot; Not only could they not be reused, they were also slandered and ostracized by others. Opportunities that once seemed close at hand are actually out of reach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/895515d194.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;709&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/895515d194.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259847&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Bai once lamented in a poem that &quot;the road is difficult and divergent&quot;, but then he wrote, &quot;There will be long winds and waves, and the clouds and sails will rise across the sea.&quot; &quot;. The picture shows a still from the movie &quot;Chang&#39;an 30,000 Miles&quot;. Information map&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Yangbing&#39;s &quot;Preface to the Thatched Cottage Collection&quot; and Liu Quanbai&#39;s &quot;Li Junjie Ji&quot; both pointed out that there were more than one or two people who slandered Li Bai. Wei Hao&#39;s &quot;Preface to the Collection of Li Hanlin&quot; names the slanderers: Xuanzong once intended to appoint Li Bai as Zhongshu Sheren, but he was slandered by his consort, Zhang Shuo&#39;s son Zhang Bian, and it was not realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nowadays, Li Bai&#39;s own political limitations are gradually being valued and emphasized. Zeng Yueyu and Zhou Shi described Li Bai&#39;s incompetent official performance in the novel &quot;Li Bai Trilogy&quot;: &quot;Li Bai has drafted several official edicts, which are related to the recent personnel changes in the DPRK. Logically, before the official announcement, the content must be strict Keep it secret. Li Bai, who was drunk, didn&#39;t care about that at all. He took advantage of the drunkenness to use the internal information as oral news, spreading it around regardless of occasion or location.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text -align: left;&quot;>;There is no way to verify whether Li Bai ever drafted official documents, and the degree of leakage may not be as exaggerated as described, but there is evidence for such writing. Fan Chuanzheng, who wrote the inscription for Li Bai, said that he &quot;went in and out of the province while drunk, and had to talk about the greenhouse trees.&quot; Wang Qi of the Qing Dynasty also suspected that he &quot;had leaked the secrets of the ban while drunk, and the Ming Emperor ignored it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Fangmin, a professor at Northwest University, researched based on Li Zhao&#39;s &quot;Hanlin Chronicles&quot; that the Hanlin Academy in the Tang Dynasty had particularly strict requirements on work style. Any carelessness in words or deeds would be punished. It may ruin the political future. He concluded that those who served in the Hanlin Academy would be more cautious than bureaucrats in other institutions. He also discovered that Xuanzong himself had personal experience of the harm of drunkenness and had abstained from alcohol for the rest of his life. Therefore, Li Bai&#39;s addiction to drinking could not help but make Xuanzong worry about appointing him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For Li Bai, returning from the political center frustrated, being slandered and alienated can be said to be his true feelings at that time. However, due to his personality and officialdom Political alienation and conflicts led to another reason for his political failure, which was also obscured to some extent. In the final analysis, Li Bai&#39;s frustration in waiting for imperial edicts was the political failure of a talented poet.&quot; Li Fangmin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xuanzong, who once &quot;gave food on a bed of seven treasures and a spoon in his hand&quot;, gave the poet a grand courtesy, but whether he would let Li Bai participate in politics must be marked by a question mark. In Duan Chengshi&#39;s &quot;Youyang Zazu&quot;, Xuanzong said to Gao Lishi, &quot;This man is really poor.&quot; Meng Qi&#39;s &quot;Benshi Shi&quot; records that Xuanzong &quot;used it as a non-corridor temple vessel, so he dismissed it with an imperial edict.&quot; Everyone is saying that Li Bai left an impression on Xuanzong, and that this person was not worthy of elegance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The discord between Li Bai&#39;s celebrity temperament and officialdom is concentrated in the matter of &quot;taking off his boots&quot;. Academic circles have different opinions on whether Li Bai ever asked Gao Lishi to take off his boots. Some scholars regard it as a novelist&#39;s statement and cannot be trusted. Zhou Xunchu, a professor at Nanjing University, believes that although Gao Lishi was the most favored eunuch by Xuanzong, under normal circumstances, Li Bai would not have ordered him to take off his boots. However, &quot;Li Bai was wild in nature and was drunk, so there was no clear reason to exclude this matter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The movie &quot;The Legend of the Demon Cat&quot; combines the two anecdotes of Lishi taking off his boots and writing &quot;Qing Ping Tiao&quot;. Gao Lishi asked Li Bai to compose a poem for Yang Yuhuan, and Li Bai took off his boots. After two rounds of fighting, Gao Lishi reluctantly took off a black leather boot for Li Bai. Li Bai was half drunk and half awake while writing &quot;Qing Ping Diao&quot;, which was praised by Yang Yuhuan, but Li Bai bluntly said that he did not write it specifically for her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The Tang Dynasty is really amazing if you have you.&quot; In the movie, Yang Yuhuan appreciates this sincerity. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The moon shines on Qinchuan on Mount Emei&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 744, on a spring night in Chang&#39;an City where flowers were blooming, Li Bai drank wine alone. There was no one around, but he was determined not to drink the contents of the cup quietly, so he sang and danced wildly, inviting the bright moon in the sky and the lonely shadow on the ground to drink together. He wants to get drunk, and then heaven, earth, and himself will cease to exist, and everything that is not going as he wants will be annihilated. At this time, it was less than two years since Li Bai was waiting for imperial edict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On an autumn night half a year ago&lt;/span>;, he was slandered and shunned in the officialdom, and his ambitions were difficult to realize. The frustrated Li Bai thought of the moon in his hometown: &quot; The dim clouds are falling, and the love of the past is dim. The green rose moon on the autumn mountain, who will see it tonight?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Finally, he left Chang&#39;an, leaving only Read such masterpieces as &quot;Drinking Alone Under the Moon&quot; and &quot;Wine to Ask the Moon&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At this time, Li Bai had gone through two-thirds of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;On the Nine Heavens of Chang&#39;an Palace, this place was once a close minister.&quot; Everything suddenly disappeared and became a memory. Li Bai&#39;s hope of finding a way out in the court was shattered, and he urgently needed to find spiritual sustenance. His deceased wife left behind a pair of children, but the time he spent with the children was far less than the amount of time he spent practicing Taoism in seclusion with the Taoist priests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the Ziji Palace of the Taoist Temple in Jinan, Li Bai asked the Taoist priest Gao Rugui to teach him the Taoism and became a Taoist priest. From the time when Tianbao left Chang&#39;an in the late spring of the third year of Tianbao&#39;s reign, to when he traveled south to Wuyue in the fifth year of Tianbao&#39;s reign, this was the period when he was most worldly-minded. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Du Fu and Li Bai also met at this time. Du Fu experienced the blow of failing the imperial examination, and with a common depressing mood, he saw the depth and persistence behind Li Bai&#39;s wild and unrestrained attitude. &quot;We spend our days drinking and singing wildly, who is the hero of flying and domineering.&quot; This sympathy for each other continued in the lives of the two poets, even if they never met again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While wandering in the south, Li Bai kept witnessing the disappearance of old friends, and his mentality changed. When he arrived in Siming (now Shaoxing, Zhejiang), he paid homage to He Zhizhang, who died of illness here, and missed the years when they met in Chang&#39;an to exchange wine with each other. While in Jinling, another series of bad news came: his friend Cui Chengfu was demoted, Li Shizhi was forced to commit suicide, and Li Yong and Pei Dunfu were killed with a stick. Li Linfu, who was in power, was imprisoned many times, unjust cases appeared one after another, and the government and the public were filled with an atmosphere of terror. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai could no longer feel safe in seclusion. He often worried about the fate of the country, and his passion for serving the world deep in his heart burned again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;He often expressed his longing to retire to the wild mountains and rivers, but whenever he had the opportunity, he always expressed his desire to return to the court immediately. He just couldn&#39;t get rid of going to the emperor&#39;s side. The ideal and desire to achieve great things,&quot; Ha Jin wrote in &quot;The Road to Heaven: The Biography of Li Bai.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After getting married for the second time in Liang Yuan, he went north to the land of Youyan, hoping to seek development by joining the army. In the poem presented to the judge He Changhao, Li Bai&#39;s intention is obvious. He is ashamed to be a scholar of Zhangju, and he is unwilling to be like Geng Yin. He actually wants to rise up with a sword and collect extraordinary achievements in the desert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On this trip north, Li Bai arrived at the jurisdiction of Anlu Mountain, and perhaps saw clearly the truth that the latter was preparing to rebel. Li Bai returned frustrated. He felt helpless against the internal and external troubles of the Li Tang Dynasty, so he could only seek seclusion in the south again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Besides studying Taoism, Li Bai, who has stars on his temples, is increasingly aware of the importance of one thing. &quot;Knowing what is wrong at fifty is what the ancients have done. If you make up for your mistakes with words, you will live forever.&quot; &quot;I am determined to delete the story and reflect it for thousands of years.&quot; He made it clear that there is no hope of meritorious service, and perhaps his destiny is to make words. It can also be said that Li Bai truly became aware of his identity as a poet when he was around fifty years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai&#39;s first wandering ended with the scene of entering Chang&#39;an; the last wandering also had an event that brought it to an end, that is, joining the team of Yongwang Li Lin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, the Anshi Rebellion broke out, and people fled the war and were displaced. Wang Changling returned to his hometown, and when passing through Jianghuai, he was killed by the governor who hated him. Du Fu moved his family to Yanzhou for refuge. He heard that after Suzong ascended the throne in Lingwu, he went north to Lingwu and was captured by the rebels on the way and taken to Chang&#39;an. The poet Wang Wei was taken prisoner to Luoyang by the rebels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai and his wife Zong fled south to seek refuge and lived in seclusion in Lushan Mountain. He once planned to lobby the Li Tang clan in Jiangnan to raise troops to serve the king, and had dealings with both Xu Wang Yannian and Wu Wang Zhi. It happened that Yong Wang Li Lin raised his army and patrolled eastward to Xunyang. He repeatedly invited him to be an aide, and Li Bai finally agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He is 56 years old and this is probably his last chance. This person with a complex of the Eastern Jin Dynasty feels that the old dream of the previous dynasty is right in front of him. At the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Five Husties disrupted China, and the Eastern Jin Dynasty established its country in Jinling, inheriting the lineage of the Central Plains. Will the Anshi Rebellion achieve Li Bai just like the Battle of Feishui in the previous dynasty achieved Xie An? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Fangmin understood that it was inevitable for Li Bai to join the Yongwang Li Lin. This move combined the objective situation and subjective wishes. He speculated that when Li Lin&#39;s lobbyist Wei Zichun was lobbying Li Bai, he hinted that Li Lin&#39;s actions in Jiangling and even on the eastward tour were in accordance with Xuanyuan&#39;s purpose and had the strategic purpose of managing Jiangnan. With these, he was able to impress Li Bai, who had an old love for Xuanzong as a monarch and a minister, and once again inspired his desire to help the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Lin was defeated, Li Bai was downgraded from a capital crime to a first-class crime, and was sentenced to Changliu Yelang. He set out from Xunyang, traveled to Dongting, and went up to the Three Gorges. When he first arrived in Wushan, he encountered a nationwide amnesty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At this time, the counter-insurgency war was still going on. Not only was a large area of ​​land north of the Yellow River in Shi Siming&#39;s hands, but the rebels continued to invade the south. The situation was very serious. After wandering for thousands of miles, Li Bai once again had the idea of ​​​​serving the world. In Jiangxia, the political center of the south, while waiting for news about his friend Wei Liangzai in the capital, he went to visit some officials and waited for several months. , the imperial court showed no sign of conscription. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With no hope of meritorious service, Li Bai then thought of writing poems and speeches. &quot;Qu Ping&#39;s poems and poems hang over the sun and moon, and the Chu king&#39;s terrace is empty on the hills.&quot; He compared the two lives of Qu Yuan and the King of Chu: Qu Yuan was loyal and patriotic, but was exiled, but his poems and poems can compete with the sun and moon and are immortal through the ages; while the King of Chu The palaces, towers and pavilions built with extravagance and lust have long since disappeared, leaving nothing but desolate hills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai asked people to compile collections three times during his lifetime. Once he invited Duke Dongqian of the Han Dynasty, once he invited Wei Hao, and once he invited his clan uncle Li Yangbing. The end of Qian Gong&#39;s manuscript is unknown. Wei Hao followed Li Bai all the way, and the two became friends with each other. Li Bai gave him all the manuscripts at that time. Wei Hao was the editor selected by Li Bai when he was in good health and thoughtful. However, the &quot;Collection of Li Hanlin&quot; he compiled for Li Bai were mostly fragments recovered from the Anshi Rebellion where &quot;all the chapters and sentences were exhausted&quot;. Li Bai was seriously ill in his later years and had no time to sort out the drafts. There was only one Li Yangbing around. Entrusting the poem manuscript to the pillow, there is no choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Li Bai was 60 years old, he returned to Xunyang and climbed Mount Lu again, determined to spend the rest of his years traveling as an immortal and learning Taoism. However, he could not forget about the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When he heard that Shi Chaoyi&#39;s power was back on the rise and Li Guangbi sent troops to suppress it, he resolutely asked Ying to participate, but he returned halfway due to illness. Li Bai is old. But the passion that had been ignited in him since his youth had never been extinguished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;His understanding of things, his political ideals and thinking have been like this throughout his life. He has established his ideas since he was young and implemented them. I think People like us would never know ourselves ten years ago, but from youth to old age, he maintained an innocent young heart.&quot; Ding Ying lamented to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 762, when Emperor Daizong came to the throne, he searched widely for talents and granted Li Bai the official position of Zuo Shiyi. However, &quot;he was not born with enough salary, but he became an official after he was not born.&quot; When the edict came, Li Bai had already passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are different opinions on the cause of Li Bai&#39;s death. &quot;Jumping into the river to catch the moon&quot; or &quot;riding a whale to catch the moon&quot; have always been talked about. Japanese sinologist Tomohisa Matsuura believes that these legends are sensitive to Li Bai&#39;s hobby. Li Bai unconditionally affirmed the existence of the moon and pursued the integration with the bright moon. &lt;p>; There are earth-shattering articles.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A thousand years later, Gong Zizhen said in &quot;The Most Recorded Collection of Li Bai&quot;: &quot;Zhuang (Zhou) and Qu (Yuan) Shi cannot be combined. Combine it with your heart and start from the beginning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/d4e35e8ee3.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/d4e35e8ee3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 259848&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Bai’s hometown Taibai Stele Forest contains mainly Li Bai&#39;s poems written by famous calligraphers and painters of past dynasties and couplets praising Li Bai.

However, this comprehensive functional paralysis lasted for nearly 12 hours, which is also the longest failure of Didi Chuxing in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Didi Chuxing’s previously announced financial report for the third quarter of 2023, the total transaction volume of China’s travel business in a single quarter was 72.5 billion yuan, and the average daily order volume reached 31.3 million. With this “collapse” Calculating the duration of the failure, it is estimated that Didi will lose over 10 million orders and over 400 million transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As for the reason why Didi Chuxing App crashed for a long time, Didi Chuxing has not responded as of press time. However, judging from the system failure, some relevant people in the industry pointed out that the cause of the failure is likely to come from Didi’s own computer room network problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data shows that as a network service that requires extremely high response speed to data volume, the frequency of Didi Chuxing failures is not low. On September 22, 2022, users reported that Didi Chuxing could not be used normally. At that time, Didi Chuxing responded that &quot;due to a computer room network failure, some Didi services were affected.&quot; The failure had been repaired within half a year. On February 25, 2021, &quot;Didi crashed&quot; also appeared on the hot search. Didi Chuxing responded at the time that it was due to a &quot;system abnormality&quot; and the fault was quickly resolved. Earlier in October 2019, July 2016 and October 2015, Didi also experienced system failures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that Didi Chuxing’s cloud services are mainly supported by Didi Cloud. According to Didi Cloud&#39;s official website, Didi Chuxing&#39;s cloud computing services are based on Didi Chuxing&#39;s business technology and experience accumulation. It adopts leading cloud computing architecture, high-specification server cluster construction, high-performance resource allocation mechanism, and refined operation model, and is committed to It provides developers with IT infrastructure cloud services that are simple, fast, efficient, stable, cost-effective, safe and reliable. According to Southern+ reporters, as early as March this year, Didi Cloud no longer provided public cloud services to the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Have Didi ride-hailing and other services resumed?
