In 2022, the total number of kindergartens nationwide will decrease by 5,610 compared with the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, news of large-scale closure of kindergartens has spread in many places. After the annual inspection of private kindergartens in Haikou ended recently, a total of 33 kindergartens were suspended, accounting for 6.4% of the total number of private kindergartens in the country; in September this year, 17 kindergartens in Longhai District, Zhangzhou City were terminated, accounting for 7.8% of the total number of kindergartens in the district in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts believe that the number and number of kindergartens may decrease at an accelerated pace in 2023. While the demographic dividend is declining, it has provided an opportunity to adjust the layout of preschool education and promote universal and inclusive development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National County Preschool Education Popularization Supervision and Evaluation Promotion Conference was held recently. The 21st Century Business Herald learned that the information at the meeting showed that the popularity rate of preschool education in some places has increased significantly. The next step for supervision and evaluation is to Adhere to problem orientation and accurately grasp key points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the school-age population has been significantly reduced, it will still be a medium- to long-term process for preschool education to reach universal standards. The crux of the problem is that kindergarten teachers have low incomes and large salary gaps, which urgently require local governments to increase financial security. intensity. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kindergarten closures continue&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Data from the Linquan County Government in February this year showed that there were 58,243 children in kindergarten in the county in 2023, a 9.2% decrease from the previous year. It decreased in the fourth year, and the decline suddenly increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that from 2019 to 2022, the number of kindergartens in Linquan County was 377, 422, 425, and 425 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August this year, the Linquan County Education Bureau issued an announcement that 50 local private kindergartens would cease operations. Among them, 12 private kindergartens applied to terminate their operations, 38 private kindergartens had no actual enrollment or school operation, and their school operating licenses had expired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that many of the 12 kindergartens that applied to terminate their operations have only been registered since 2021, and the latest of them was registered in June 2022. It was closed just one year after opening, which shows that the student supply situation of local kindergartens is tight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The large-scale closure of kindergartens does not only occur in Linquan County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September, 17 private kindergartens in Longhai District, Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province applied to terminate their operations. In November, the results of the 2023 annual inspection of private primary and secondary schools and kindergartens in Haikou City were released, and 33 private kindergartens were suspended. Recently, six kindergartens in Ruian City under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou City have ceased operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts predict that the number and number of kindergartens will further decrease. On the one hand, it is due to the continued decrease in the number of births in recent years, and on the other hand, the gross enrollment rate in kindergartens has reached a high level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the national gross enrollment rate for preschool education will be 89.7%, but it is close to or reaching 100% in many places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Linquan County has reached 96.57% in 2022, and Anhui Province has reached 98.2% in 2022. Data released by the Henan Provincial Department of Education on November 14 show that the current gross enrollment rate of preschool education in the province is 91.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that preschool education degrees in various places will face overall saturation, with a surplus in rural areas and a shortage in urban areas. Taking Linquan County as an example, 37 of the 50 kindergartens closed were rural kindergartens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This poses new challenges to kindergarten layout. Kindergarten children are too young to be suitable for boarding, so rural kindergartens cannot be blindly withdrawn and merged, but the retained kindergartens need to meet specified standards. Too few rural students will make it difficult to operate high-standard kindergartens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some places are cracking down on planning. Shandong Province issued a document in August this year to optimize the layout of rural primary and secondary kindergartens and clarify planning and layout requirements in terms of school-age population, enrollment radius, and regional coordination. On November 7, the Shandong Provincial Department of Education began soliciting opinions on the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Comprehensively Promoting the Integrated Management of Kindergarten Towns and Villages&quot;. This document proposed that when counties (cities, districts) prepare overall kindergarten layout plans, they should simultaneously clarify the kindergartens in each town and town. Layout, in accordance with the requirements for promoting integrated management of towns and villages, clarify the establishment and construction of the central park and branch parks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The total number of rural kindergartens has decreased. In fact, the decrease is greater than the increase. In October this year, Linquan County approved the construction of three more rural kindergartens to meet the kindergarten admission needs of different regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are great differences in the development of universal and inclusive education in various regions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The reduction in the number of kindergartens and the number of children has provided an opportunity for the universal and inclusive development of preschool education. After all, limited resources can be more fully allocated. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 10, the National County Preschool Education Supervision and Evaluation Promotion Conference was held in Jinan City, Shandong Province. The meeting emphasized that we should steadily carry out supervision and evaluation work on universal preschool education in counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Carrying out supervision and evaluation of universal preschool education in counties is a deployment made in the &quot;Several Opinions on Deepening Reform and Standardized Development of Preschool Education&quot; in November 2018. The Ministry of Education issued notices twice in 2020, clarifying Indicators and processes for supervision and evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is another important educational supervision work carried out in the field of basic education in addition to the supervision and evaluation of the high-quality and balanced development of compulsory education in our country. The establishment of counties (cities, districts) must achieve &quot;quantity standards and quality standards&quot;. After two rounds of evaluation at the provincial and national levels, it was finally recognized as a national county for the universalization of preschool education in five aspects: &quot;qualified, well-guaranteed, sound system, and satisfied with the masses&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the national to the local level, special attention is paid to this work. In December 2020, an on-site meeting to launch the national accreditation of national pre-school education universalization and inclusiveness supervision and evaluation in counties was held in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. The then deputy director of the Ministry of Education attended the meeting, and the expert group gave feedback to Qingbaijiang District and Shuangliu District of Chengdu City, which applied for national assessment at that time. In March 2021, these two districts were the first in the country to be recognized as national pre-school education universal HP counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, no public information has disclosed the progress of national recognition. Until the National County Preschool Education Supervision and Evaluation Work Promotion Conference was held on November 10. Vice Minister of Education Wang Jiayi attended the meeting, and the expert group fed back the supervision and evaluation opinions to the Shandong Provincial Department of Education. 21st Century Business Herald learned that more than 20 counties (cities, districts) in Shandong Province have applied for national assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the differences between regions are too large, and the assessment work will not be completed overnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Sichuan Province took the lead in breaking through the national assessment in 2021, it proposed to achieve the entire region to pass the national assessment by 2030. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The economically developed eastern region is moving relatively quickly. For example, Zhejiang Province has proposed to complete the assessment and identification of more than 90% of counties (cities, districts) by 2025, and strives to complete all of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even in Zhejiang, regional disparities are large. In terms of indicators, the &quot;quantity standards&quot; requirements such as the gross kindergarten enrollment rate in the three years of preschool, the coverage rate of inclusive kindergartens, and the proportion of children in public kindergartens are easy to achieve, and the regional differences are not large; the teachers are qualified, the conditions for running kindergartens are qualified, It is difficult to achieve &quot;qualified quality&quot; indicators such as qualified nursing and education, and there are large regional differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A questionnaire survey of 100,000 kindergarten principals and full-time teachers across the country showed that only 85.04% of teachers hold teacher qualification certificates, of which only 77.95% hold kindergarten teacher qualification certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person from an educational and scientific research institution in an economically developed prefecture-level city in Zhejiang Province told the 21st Century Business Herald that the number of kindergartens in the city is similar to that in Hangzhou, but the total number of children in the kindergarten is about 100,000 less than that in Hangzhou. This is This means that the average number of children in the city&#39;s kindergartens is small, mainly because the local rural kindergartens are &quot;low, small and scattered&quot; and the degree of group education is not high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But he also pointed out that “the assessment of graded kindergartens mainly examines hardware indicators such as houses, venues, and toys. The more important factors affecting the quality of childcare are actually teachers and childcare workers. In addition, rural kindergartens pay too much attention to hardware facilities. There are also questions about whether it is wasteful and whether it can adapt to future population changes.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Adhere to a problem-oriented approach to strengthen supervision&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Teachers are the most important factor affecting the quality of preschool education, and they are also the biggest obstacle to universal education. factors that benefit development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National County Preschool Education Supervision and Evaluation Promotion Conference on November 10 required that all localities should adhere to a problem orientation, strengthen the number of kindergarten teachers with qualified qualifications, &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot; for both staff and non-staff teachers in public kindergartens, and pay for teaching staff Supervision on issues such as &quot;five insurances and one housing fund&quot;, safe and hygienic food in kindergartens. Regarding teachers’ requirements, “four accounted for three.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A kindergarten teacher in Linquan County told the 21st Century Business Herald that local kindergartens still have large class sizes because there is a shortage of kindergarten teachers. The shortage of teachers is mainly due to low salary and limited attractiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My monthly salary is about 3,000 yuan.” The above-mentioned kindergarten teacher said, “Whether there is a staff establishment or not has a great impact on the income of kindergarten teachers. Teachers on staff are paid very well, and all the benefits combined can reach 3,000 yuan per year. 70,000 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coordinating the number of kindergarten teachers is the key to ensuring teachers&#39; remuneration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shangyou County, Jiangxi Province, gave a speech at the National County Preschool Education Supervision and Evaluation Promotion Conference on experience exchange. It was said that the county currently has 564 kindergarten teachers, including 350 teachers in public kindergartens and 214 teachers in private kindergartens. name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are currently only 134 teachers in public kindergartens in the county. This is the result of adding 86 public kindergarten teachers in the past five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, Shangyou County has innovated a mechanism. Public kindergarten teachers are composed of two parts: the approved establishment number and the employment registration number. In response to the shortage of teachers in public kindergartens, the county editorial committee approved the total number of registered kindergarten teachers, and publicly recruited 216 registered kindergarten teachers within the total control, which better met the needs of teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Increasing local financial support is the basis for ensuring teachers’ remuneration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yantai High-tech Zone has applied for national assessment. According to an article on the website of the Shandong Provincial Department of Education on November 15, from 2020 to 2022, the proportion of preschool education funding in the High-tech Zone has increased year by year, with a cumulative investment of 140 million yuan. Accounting for 23.17% of education funding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chu Zhaohui, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Educational Sciences, told the 21st Century Business Herald that in 2008, when he participated in the formulation and demonstration of the &quot;National Medium and Long-term Education Reform and Development Plan (2010-2020)&quot;, he calculated Preschool education funding should account for 9% of local education funding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“But except for developed areas such as Beijing and Shanghai, many places have not yet achieved this.” Chu Zhaohui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the problems of incomplete preschool education guarantee mechanism and insufficient universal resources, the Ministry of Education and other three departments’ &quot;Opinions on Implementing the Action Plan for Expanding and Improving Basic Education in the New Era&quot; clearly stated that students in public kindergartens in various regions In principle, the average public expenditure standard should reach 600 yuan per person per year in 2024. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The lack of funding guarantee will inevitably affect the recruitment of kindergarten teachers and the guarantee of wages and benefits. Therefore, to truly attach importance to preschool education, we need to improve funding guarantee, especially the financial subsidies for private inclusive kindergartens must be in place.” Zhaohui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访国际货币基金组织原秘书长林建海：中国在IMF的“份额”大幅提升只是时间问题]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261014]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-21 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the first year after the epidemic, my country’s economic recovery momentum has attracted the attention of all countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 15, 2023, the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as the IMF in English) raised China&#39;s economic growth forecast for 2023 and 2024, saying that China is building a high-quality, sustainable and inclusive economy. Efforts are being made on multiple fronts to achieve sexual growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The IMF is the world&#39;s two largest financial institution alongside the World Bank. It has the important mission of promoting international monetary cooperation, supporting trade development and economic growth, and preventing policies that are detrimental to prosperity. Whenever there is an economic crisis or financial crisis globally or locally, the IMF will always appear in time. Therefore, the IMF is known as the &quot;fire brigade&quot; in financial crises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the reform and opening up, our country has gradually become an important member of the IMF. Since the restoration of its legal seat in the IMF in 1980, my country&#39;s &quot;quota&quot; share has jumped to the third place; since the RMB joined the Special Drawing Rights (SDR, also known as &quot;paper gold&quot;) in 2016, it is the IMF&#39;s currency based on the recognition of member states. A book asset that is allocated according to the share of contributions to the IMF and can be used to repay IMF debts and make up for the international balance of payments deficit among member governments.) Currency Basket So far, the weight of the RMB in the currency basket has been increased to 12.28%, becoming an international reserve currency. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did my country and the IMF go from acquaintance to becoming important partners? How can China gradually increase its “share”? Why does China’s “share” not match China’s proportion in the global economy? What far-reaching significance does the increase in the weight of &quot;inclusion&quot; have on the internationalization of the RMB? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, Southern Weekend conducted an exclusive interview with Lin Jianhai, former Secretary-General of the IMF and Executive Vice Chairman of the International Financial Forum (IFF). Since joining the IMF in 1989, Lin Jianhai has served in the IMF for more than 30 years. He grew from an ordinary employee to an IMF executive. During this period, he took office as the Deputy Secretary-General of the IMF in March 2010 and was promoted to the Secretary-General of the IMF from 2012 to 2020. He is the first Chinese to hold this position. He has personally experienced and deeply participated in the entire decision-making process of many major events such as the IMF quota reform and the inclusion of the RMB into the basket. He is the main organizer of major meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend, Lin Jianhai said that it is imperative for the IMF to play its due role in the global economic system and reform its own governance structure and effectiveness without waiting for others. China&#39;s current share in the IMF is far lower than its share in the global economy. As the economy continues to develop, my country&#39;s share of IMF China will definitely increase significantly. This is not a matter of if, but a matter of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/Vo2Gp2TlGRdvAffzQkKNZijggSkQ4rjNVODVgjRA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;475&quot; height= &quot;634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/Vo2Gp2TlGRdvAffzQkKNZijggSkQ4rjNVODVgjRA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258988&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lin Jianhai, former Secretary-General of the International Monetary Fund and current Executive Vice Chairman of the International Financial Forum. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;RMB&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong >;Into the Basket&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;a milestone&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;in&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;international monetary history&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In your opinion, how has the relationship between my country and the IMF changed? of? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;my country is a founding country of the IMF and participated in the Bretton Woods Conference held in New Hampshire, USA in 1944. This conference laid the foundation for the stable development of the global economy after World War II and established the IMF and World Bank. At that time, delegations from 44 countries participated in this historic meeting, and the Kuomintang government delegation was one of them. Therefore, the relationship between my country and the IMF can be said to have a long history. In 1980, my country restored its seat in the IMF and opened a new chapter in exchanges with the IMF. Over the past four decades, my country and the IMF have grown to know each other and become important partners. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you personally get involved with the IMF? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Interestingly, although my country did not have many contacts with the IMF at the beginning of its restoration of seats, it has been mentioned in some international financial publications. There is a brief description of the IMF. For example, in the spring of 1981, I co-wrote an article titled &quot;On the Multiple Exchange Rate System and the Internal Settlement Price of my country&#39;s Trade Foreign Exchange&quot; with a teacher who taught international finance at the Beijing Institute of Foreign Trade at the time, which was published in the school&#39;s &quot;Foreign Trade Research&quot; &quot;Phase one. In this article, we introduce the concept and types of multiple exchange rate systems, the IMF&#39;s regulations restricting member states from implementing multiple exchange rate systems, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than forty years have passed in the blink of an eye. In order to write this article, I still vividly remember the scene of browsing reference materials. To be honest, when I wrote this article, I knew nothing about the IMF. At that time, there were no systematic international finance textbooks in China. I only found a brief introduction to the IMF from the teaching materials printed by the school. However, what I didn&#39;t expect was that from then on, I would form a lifelong bond with the IMF. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In your more than 30 years of service at the IMF, the relationship between China and the IMF has Which thing in the movie impressed you the most? Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the past few decades, there have been many memorable stories in my country’s cooperation with the IMF, one of which is very meaningful. The thing is that in 2016, the RMB was included in the IMF&#39;s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency basket, and together with the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen and pound sterling, it constitutes an internationally freely usable currency officially recognized by the international community. This is a milestone in the history of the development of the international monetary and financial system. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concerning this matter, I quoted in a short article the then IMF President Christine Lagarde’s statement after the IMF Executive Board meeting: “The Executive Board has decided to include the RMB in the SDR currency basket. The decision is an important milestone in China&#39;s economic integration into the global financial system. It is a recognition of China&#39;s achievements in reforming its currency and financial system over the past many years. China&#39;s continued advancement and deepening in this area will promote Establish a more dynamic international monetary and financial system.&quot; In the book &quot;Turning Crisis into Opportunities - A Closer Look at the IMF&quot; recently published by Xinhua Publishing House, I gave a relatively detailed introduction to the inclusion of the RMB in the basket and its significance. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;From learning to active participation and leadership&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You just said that my country restored its seat in the IMF in 1980. Is the launch of reform and opening up the main reason for our country to regain its seat? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. The reform and opening up launched in 1978 was a great initiative and a milestone in the history of world economic development. Since then, our country’s economy has continued to grow and develop, and it has become deeply integrated into global economic development and governance. Significant achievements include China&#39;s restoration of its seats in the IMF and World Bank in 1980; China&#39;s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001; the launch and establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015; in 2016, the RMB was added to the SDR currency basket, and the RMB&#39;s status as an international reserve currency was confirmed; By actively participating in the G20, APEC and other summit agendas, my country has begun to play a leading role in some fields. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;my country is deeply integrated into global economic development and governance . What do you think it means? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;my country’s deep participation in global economic governance has not only created a good external environment for its own development, but also played its due role in global economic governance. role. Overall, three aspects stand out: first, from zero participation in 1980 to multi-faceted participation later; second, from one-way to multi-faceted cooperation; third, from learning to active participation and leadership. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you predict my country’s performance in international economic governance? participation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the long run, as our country’s economic strength increases, our country’s participation in international affairs will continue to deepen, and in many economies It has played a certain leading role in , trade and financial issues. Especially with the increase in China&#39;s economic size and the deepening of foreign economic, trade and financial ties, my country is having an increasingly extensive impact on the economic development of other countries. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How can our country play a more responsible role? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Currently, our country has a relatively small number of staff in international organizations, and even fewer high-level officials. Therefore, it is necessary to increase efforts to broaden and improve the training of international civil servants, improve relevant international organization management regulations, and provide a supportive environment for international organizations to set up headquarters or branches in China and achieve good operation and development. Our country&#39;s think tanks and universities should also take the initiative to maintain dialogue and cooperation with international organizations and other institutions in this field. They must be able to express their opinions rationally and rationally based on data and facts in the dialogue; they must be good at empathizing with others. , tell the story of China well and make the other party understand the story of China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Our country&#39;s share in the IMF is lower than its share in the global economy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;South Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At the beginning of the restoration of the IMF seat, my country&#39;s share in the organization accounted for about 2% of the total share. Do you think this share is in line with the national conditions at that time? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1980, my country’s GDP accounted for only about 2% of the global economy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;share&quot; of the IMF is equivalent to a country&#39;s shares in the IMF, which constitutes the IMF&#39;s equity capital, that is, its own funds. When a country joins the IMF, it is assigned an initial quota that roughly reflects the member&#39;s global economic size and contribution. The IMF determines share allocation through a formula. The current share formula consists of the weighted average of four variables, namely GDP (weighting 50%), openness (30%), economic volatility (15%) and international reserves (5 %). Therefore, calculating a country&#39;s &quot;share&quot; in the IMF is more complicated. We can simply understand &quot;share&quot; as the relative proportion of a country in the global economy, but it is not exactly the same. This is the difficulty in understanding &quot;share&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Quota&quot; determines the limit of capital contribution of member states to the IMF, and is also related to the amount of loans that member states can obtain from the IMF. &quot;Quota&quot; also determines the voting rights of member states, as well as the allocation of SDRs. the quantity obtained. Therefore, the number of “shares” is very important to member states, especially regarding their right to speak on the international economic stage. This also explains why each &quot;share&quot; reform is so important, but also so difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;36 years after my country resumed its IMF seat, that is, in January 2016 On the 27th, the IMF announced that the 2010 quota and governance reform plan officially came into effect. my country has officially become the third largest shareholder of the IMF. my country&#39;s share increased to 6.394%, and its ranking jumped from sixth to third, second only to the United States and Japan. The share almost doubled. How do you evaluate this achievement? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Currently, my country’s share in the IMF is 6.4%, which is far lower than the United States’ 17.4% and Japan’s 6.5% %, even lower than China’s share of about 18% in the global economy. At the same time, the share of many developed economies, especially European countries, is much higher than their share in the global economy. This is a challenge facing the IMF, which requires the IMF to keep pace with the times and intensify reforms to ensure its legitimacy, effectiveness and credibility. In this regard, the IMF still has a long and difficult road to go. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;IMF&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Reforming in Difficulties&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is the IMF undergoing reform? When is it expected to be completed? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The IMF is undergoing a new round of quota reform, which is scheduled to be completed in mid-December 2023. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of IMF quota reform is mainly two-fold: first, to increase the IMF’s quota funds to enhance the IMF’s “ammunition arsenal” to help member countries cope with financial crises; second, to adjust the quotas of member countries. share to reflect changes in their status in the global economy, that is, to increase the voice of emerging markets and developing countries. In the IMF&#39;s recent statement, the IMF Executive Board proposed to the Board of Governors to increase the IMF&#39;s share by 50% and distribute it according to the current share proportions of each member country, but without adjusting the share proportions of member countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this so-called &quot;capital increase&quot; is not a substantive increase in capital, but a replacement of part of the non-quota funds with newly increased quota funds, leaving the total amount of IMF loanable funds unchanged. About a trillion dollars. Although the quota reform has made progress, it is understandable that this quota reform is not ideal and does not meet the calls of emerging markets and developing countries to reform the existing international economic governance system and improve their voice. &amp;nbsp;In the current complex international situation, this may be a realistic and desirable reform option. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In this way, the IMF has been reforming under difficulties. What efforts have you made in the process of increasing my country&#39;s share? Was it particularly difficult? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From 2012 to 2020, as the Secretary-General of the IMF, I was responsible for the Board of Governors and the International Monetary Fund composed of global finance ministers and central bank governors. Coordinates with the Financial Committee and is responsible for the daily administrative affairs of the IMF Executive Board, as well as the arrangement and convening of nearly 350 Executive Board meetings each year. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this position, I have personally experienced and deeply participated in global macroeconomic policy supervision and financial crisis relief work. I have also participated in the reform of IMF quotas and voice rights and the addition of RMB to the IMF Special Drawing Rights currency. basket and other major decisions. During this period, I learned a lot and did a lot of work. I deeply realized the importance of the knowledge, experience, thinking methods and judgment accumulated in the past work process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as quota reform is concerned, I mainly do a good job in communication and coordination, assisting the IMF president to fully understand the views of member countries, eliminate doubts, and reach a consensus as much as possible. This is a long process. For example, the quota reform plan passed in 2010 did not take effect until 2016. It went through countless meetings and face-to-face discussions, but the reform finally achieved relatively ideal results. China rose from the sixth largest shareholder of the IMF to the third largest shareholder. Third, Russia, India and Brazil among the BRICS countries have also joined the ranks of the top ten shareholders of the IMF. Therefore, work is both hard, fun and rewarding, because all efforts are for the benefit of member states and the international community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Although it is difficult and slow, the IMF is still reforming. How do you anticipate my country&#39;s share in the IMF and its role? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;With the continuous development of the economy, my country’s share of the IMF will definitely increase significantly. This is not a question of whether. It&#39;s a matter of time. In order for the IMF (including the World Bank) to play its due role in the global economic system, it is imperative to reform its own governance structure and effectiveness. This requires IMF member countries to stand at the height of global economic development and changes, transcend narrow self-interests, and work together to promote the reform of voice. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The internationalization of the RMB still has a long way to go&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2022, while maintaining the currency composition of the existing SDR basket unchanged, the IMF will increase the weight of the RMB in the SDR currency basket from 10.92% to 12.28%. This is the first review result since the RMB became an SDR basket currency in 2016. Is this the result of the two-way opening up of China’s financial market? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2022, the IMF will increase the weight of the RMB in the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency basket from 10.92% to 12.28%. This is the first review completed since the RMB was officially added to the Special Drawing Rights currency basket on October 1, 2016. It reflects the IMF&#39;s recognition of the progress made in China&#39;s financial market reform and will also promote the internationalization of the RMB. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The RMB has become the fifth currency in the SDR basket since October 1, 2016. This is an important milestone for China’s economic integration into the global financial system. It is also a sign of the IMF’s reform and opening up to China, especially the It is a recognition of China’s achievements in monetary policy and financial system. The inclusion of RMB into the SDR basket makes the basket more diversified and representative, thereby helping to improve the stability of the SDR and its attractiveness as an international reserve asset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Currently, what profound impact has it had on the IMF and China? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The currency composition in the IMF SDR basket reflects the importance of these currencies in the international trade and financial system, and its composition and interest rates The level directly determines the level of IMF credit interest rates. The importance of this to lending countries is self-evident. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The IMF&#39;s review once again confirmed the rationality of the SDR basket currency combination and increased the weight of the RMB in the SDR basket, which also shows that the internationalization of the RMB is constantly advancing. For China, this is an important recognition and a responsibility, and it is also the driving force for the continued internationalization of the RMB. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If the RMB is to achieve continued internationalization, how can my country’s financial industry achieve a high level? Reform and Opening? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Jianhai:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Looking forward to the prospects of RMB internationalization, the following aspects deserve attention:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, economy Sustained growth is the basis for the further internationalization of the RMB. Over the past four decades, with rapid economic development, my country has become the world&#39;s second largest economy and largest trading nation, laying the foundation for the gradual internationalization of the RMB. Continuing to maintain stable economic growth, improving the macroeconomic and financial policy framework, and preventing violent fluctuations in the financial market are crucial to the further internationalization of the RMB. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, reform and opening up is the guarantee for the further internationalization of the RMB. China&#39;s foreign economic activities continue to grow and develop, driving the overseas transactions and use of RMB. It is imperative to steadily advance the opening of capital accounts, continue to expand financial opening to the outside world, and promote the cross-border use of RMB. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, improving the financial system and deepening the development of the financial market are the driving forces for the further internationalization of the RMB. The depth, breadth and openness of the domestic financial market are conducive to enhancing the confidence and use of the RMB in foreign markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, continuous improvement of the exchange rate system is a booster for the further internationalization of the RMB. Adhering to market supply and demand as the basis, enhancing the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate, and giving full play to the function of the exchange rate as an automatic stabilizer in regulating macroeconomics and the balance of payments, will help to give full play to its price signal role and improve the efficiency of resource allocation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fifth, promoting cross-border trade pricing and settlement is a breakthrough for the further internationalization of the RMB. China&#39;s huge foreign trade scale is the biggest advantage in promoting the internationalization of the RMB. At present, the proportion of local currency settlement in China&#39;s trade still has considerable room for growth. Starting from cross-border trade pricing and settlement, improving cross-border RMB settlement services can achieve twice the result with half the effort in promoting the internationalization of RMB. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overall, the RMB’s inclusion in the SDR and the increase in its weight are important events for China, the IMF and its member countries, and will benefit the country in the long run. In the foreseeable future, the currencies in the SDR basket will continue to serve as the world&#39;s major reserve currencies. However, compared with the role of the US dollar in the international financial system, the internationalization of the RMB still has a long way to go, and it can be said that there is a long way to go. The further internationalization of the RMB is inseparable from the support of China&#39;s sustained economic growth, high-level opening up, and continuous improvement of the financial system and market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[湖南衡阳政务数据经营权出让被叫停：公共数据不应“资本化”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261010]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-21 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The &quot;nation&#39;s first&quot; public data franchise transfer transaction was halted. Well parked! Public data should be used with caution and should not be used as a &quot;franchise&quot; and become a tool for a few people to make money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Securities Daily&quot; report, on November 10, Hunan Hengyang City Public Resources Trading Center issued the &quot;Hengyang Municipal Government Data Resources and Smart City Franchise Transfer Project Transaction Announcement&quot; to transfer the city&#39;s political data Resources and smart city franchise rights are listed at a base price of 1.802 billion yuan, with a price increase of 10 million yuan. But a few days later, the transaction was requested to be suspended by the Hengyang Administrative Approval Service Bureau, the transferor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data is considered by some to be another &quot;factor of production&quot; in addition to land, labor, capital, and technology. Many organizations that own data want to get a piece of it. This &quot;first in the country&quot; government data auction announcement attracted great attention, and some people in the industry spoke highly of it, believing that it was the first of its kind to capitalize on government data elements. Some even believed that government data might replace land and become the basis for local government An important asset and source of income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the prerequisite for the transaction is clear ownership. Who does the data belong to? A piece of data contains information that usually involves different parties. For example, a person purchases a piece of clothing from an online store. This message involves consumers and online stores. So, who owns the rights to this information? If it belongs to consumers, theoretically, online stores cannot sell this information. If the ownership of the information belongs to the online store operator, do consumers have the right to withdraw and request the operator to delete this information? Even if only a subset of consumers ask for information to be deleted, the integrity of the entire data set is greatly weakened. How valuable is such data? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The issue of data ownership is even more important when it comes to public data. The so-called public data refers to data generated by administrative agencies, public institutions, public institutions, state-owned enterprises and other public institutions in the process of performing their duties or providing public services. For example, case data from public hospitals, subway passenger flow data, census data from the Bureau of Statistics, marriage and divorce data from the Civil Affairs Bureau, etc. It is questionable whether these public authorities have the rights to this data. Under intellectual property law, official documents and other content produced by government agencies in performing their duties are not copyrightable. The reason is that using copyright to protect these official documents is not conducive to the disclosure of government information and is not conducive to social and public interests. In the field of public data, should this principle also be followed? Public agencies cannot own data obtained and formed in the course of performing their duties? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, data from public institutions usually contain sensitive information such as citizens’ names and ID numbers. In theory, public data should be desensitized before being made available to outsiders. However, hasty operations may result in incomplete desensitization and leave behind some personal information. Even if there is no problem with the desensitization process, if the granularity of the data provided is too fine, it is still possible to deduce already desensitized personal information through cross-analysis with other data. In a situation where data leakage is very serious and almost everyone has nowhere to hide in the face of big data, this possibility cannot but be considered. Once the data is desensitized, it may be used by telecommunications network fraud, causing heavy losses to the parties concerned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the &quot;20 Data Articles&quot; issued by the central government (&quot;Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Building a Data Basic System to Better Play the Role of Data Elements&quot;) pointed out that the use of data must be in order to safeguard the national Data security, protection of personal information and business secrets are the premise. Especially for public data, it must be utilized on the premise of protecting personal privacy and ensuring public safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The information in public data is all information produced or obtained by relevant agencies in the process of performing administrative management or other public duties. According to relevant regulations on government information disclosure, information produced or obtained by administrative agencies in the course of performing their duties, except for information involving confidentiality or personal privacy, should be disclosed in a timely and accurate manner. According to the same principle, information generated by other public agencies in the course of providing public services should also be disclosed as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data is a collection of pieces of information. Every piece of information in the public data set should be made public, so naturally the entire data set should also be made public, and cannot be given or received privately, becoming an &quot;asset&quot; that the government can sell. From this perspective, even those public data that can be used should not be auctioned or &quot;franchised&quot; and become a tool for some people to make money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;20 Data Articles&quot; emphasize the need to protect the public interest in the supply and use of public data. To protect public interests, the best way is to make it public, not &quot;auction&quot;. Unlike land and other exclusive production factors, data is not exclusive. If a piece of land is given to A, B can no longer use it. Therefore, in order to maximize public interests, the land can be auctioned and awarded to the highest bidder, with the proceeds used by the government for public utilities. The data is different. If A is used, B can still be used. The reusable nature of data determines that only disclosure can achieve greater utilization, create greater value, and is more in line with the public interest. If the use of public data is handed over to a &quot;third party&quot; in the form of a &quot;franchise&quot;, it is actually giving this third party the power to monopolize public data with administrative power. This third party then charges other users, which increases the costs for other users and harms the interests of the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In China, public data occupies a very large proportion and status in data. Currently, more than 80% of China’s data is in the hands of the government. As the pressure on government revenue and expenditure continues to increase, it is understandable that local governments are eager to find ways to generate income that can replace land finance. But if you want to monetize the public data you hold, you must be cautious. How to use public data must go through extensive discussions and reach social consensus. Until then, it’s better to rest on the “capitalization” of public data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[第三轮中央生态环境保护督察全面启动]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261029]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-21 18:03:01&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the &quot;Central Ecological Environmental Protection Inspection Work Regulations&quot; and approved by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the third round of central ecological Environmental protection inspection will be fully launched on November 21.

Will consider themselves a victim. Her speeches and works reveal lightness, some humor, and inherent heaviness and pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the collection of essays &quot;A Bouquet for Love and the Womb&quot;, she devoted a lot of space to writing about her rebellion against her original family. Her family must be the envy of most people. Her mother is the translator Kari Haijima, and her father is Suzuki Akira, an honorary professor at Hosei University. Happiness is hard-won, and the pieces of life gradually accumulate tension between mother and daughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We are not free. Although we are not expecting a big reversal of fortune, we are still shackles. We can always feel the mother’s curse hidden between our spine and skin, and we can’t help but feel chills in our bones. .&quot; The book writes about the mother&#39;s overly ardent hopes for her daughter. She wanted to get rid of the regrets she had in her original family and married life, but she changed her mind and injected specific trivialities into her daughter&#39;s life, always in the name of love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If she follows the established path, Suzuki Ryomi can easily become the stereotype of a &quot;decent person&quot;. That was not the case. She knew a part of the world that many people knew and experienced, but few could express. After entering the night world by mistake, she discovered many familiar stories among the women around her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As long as you walk into the night, you will temporarily forget everything else. The longer you sink into the dazzling and crazy world, and the longer you stay in a world that worships emptiness as nobility, the less you can touch it. That thing.&quot; Suzuki Ryomi sold underwear to middle-aged men in high school. After graduation, she &quot;couldn&#39;t wait to go to nightclubs and work many odd jobs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The nightlife compared to the daytime is indeed paradoxical, &quot;there are as many girls as Cinderella-like as you want.&quot; Women pay for the cowherd, who is often more domineering; female escorts need to endure the domineering male guests. A large number of details more or less reflect the essence of gender issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The men and women there occasionally share the cruel joys and sorrows. As time goes by, the fragile &quot;equality&quot; will inevitably disappear, and the people in the night world have overdrawn their youth early. Many female practitioners in custom shops have decent family backgrounds and education, and college students often work part-time jobs at night; while the cowherds are often in a difficult situation, with average education levels and lack of ability to make a living. All these people will age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suzuki Ryomi went to graduate school and wrote a master&#39;s thesis on pornographic film actresses. She worked as a journalist and later resigned. In 2014, &quot;Weekly Bunshun&quot; reported on her past as an actress in pornographic films. She is now a well-known author and considered a sociologist, although she denies the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she started writing &quot;Flowers for Love and the Womb,&quot; her mother had her first cancer surgery. Some time later, my mother&#39;s cancer recurred, and she died half a year before finishing the book. Her mother repeatedly said: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I still have many things to tell you, but I don&#39;t have time.&quot; Through writing and recalling, Suzuki Ryomi discovered the similarities between herself and her mother, and also understood more about her mother&#39;s various ways of doing things. . She once said: &quot;It is very lonely to lose such an enemy and a friend.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later than &quot;Flowers for Love and the Womb&quot;, Suzuki Ryomi&#39;s correspondence with the scholar Chizuru Ueno The collection &quot;Starting from the Limit&quot; was published. She was born in 1983, more than thirty years younger than Chizuru Ueno. The age gap between the two is about the same as that of mother and daughter. It is no surprise that there is a huge difference in the perspective of understanding the world.

He was shortlisted for the Akutagawa Prize, Japan&#39;s highest literary award, for two years. He is well-known to Chinese readers for his collection of dialogues with Chizuru Ueno, &quot;Starting at the Limit.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the publisher)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;At least my mother is not the kind of person who doesn&#39;t care about the world&quot;&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is an impressive description of mother in the book: &quot;They are performing another kind of mysterious and unspeakable magic, never stopping, spreading the powder called love to us.&quot; You then recorded some suffocating past events. So, can you go back to that statement? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suzuki Ryomi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The relationship with the mother has an immeasurable impact on the child&#39;s future life. This is not a simple dichotomy of love and dislike, likes and dislikes, respect and contempt, but a complex interaction between the mother&#39;s expectations, preferences, personality and habits and the child&#39;s personality and life. Although there are exceptions, it is generally believed that mothers love their children, and I can indeed feel that my mother loves me. However, I feel that the so-called &quot;love&quot; is not always warm and soft, there is also a lot of mud and roughness in it. Many young people will more or less rebel against their parents&#39; overbearing and overly strong love and achieve independence by having a world unknown to their mothers. But even so, the relationship and influence with the mother is more or less undeniable. I use the word &quot;magic&quot; to describe this feeling: I had been a part of my mother&#39;s life, and once I became independent, I would be separated from her, but never completely separated, as if by magic. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After several years, your feelings for your mother have changed. What changes? Has the “magic” faded? Will you understand her better because of some memories? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suzuki Ryomi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Basically, I think as we grow older, we will slowly have our own world that our parents don’t know about. The &quot;magic&quot; with our mother fades because we will have faces that we can share with others but have never shown our parents, and things we have never told them. During my bad teenage years, I managed to develop a relationship with my parents: I was connected to them but didn&#39;t necessarily share everything with them. It is not so much that a certain memory has deepened my understanding of my mother, but that now that my mother has passed away and time has passed, when I am the same age as the mother who once raised me, I recall every bit of our childhood. I sometimes imagine that maybe that was the mood. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are in &quot;A Bouquet for Love and the Womb&quot; &quot;&quot; writes about the subtle emotions between mother and daughter. They both think that the other is in a better position, which seems to be a kind of competition between mother and daughter. Is this phenomenon common between mothers and daughters? Or is it unique to your family? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suzuki Ryomi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mother and daughter are the two closest and most similar people in the world. Dependent on mother&#39;s relationship. When they grow up, they are in an environment where they can conform to the same gender, and naturally a very complex and primitive competitive relationship will arise. I think many people have had this experience. During adolescence, they are unwilling to accept the female side of their mother, but sometimes mothers are also unwilling to accept the female side of their daughters. I think there is a subtle psychology in it. Both of them obviously love each other very much, but they don&#39;t want her to be like themselves. I think the meaning of parents in life is different for everyone, and for me, they are the ones who keep asking me questions. Even now that they have passed away, I feel like I am still being questioned by my mother. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In China, parents often want their children to have a partner. , or urging marriage due to family reproduction issues. Is this phenomenon common in Japan? If so, does it have anything to do with the gender of the child? Is the reason due to child care issues, or is it just a stubborn point of view? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suzuki Ryomi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent years, it is said that more and more parents value their children&#39;s wishes or feel lonely when their children finally get married. But I often heard in the past that if you are still single at the age of thirty, your parents will nag you to get married. This situation still exists in some areas of Japan and elsewhere. Marriage in Japan used to be a family affair. Marriage is a necessary means to maintain the survival of the family, so the pressure on the eldest son is particularly great. Women, for their part, want to marry themselves off, even though it has nothing to do with the survival of their own families. But Japan is a country with a lot of peer pressure. Everyone else gets married at about this age. Only my family doesn’t get married. People will talk about it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, I have recently begun to think that in real life, there may be a more real desire, and that is the happiness of children. Of course, there are forms of single happiness. But I think parents still hope that their daughters can experience the happiness of starting a family, and do not want their daughters to live alone in this world one day after they die. At least my mother is not the kind of person who doesn&#39;t care about the world, so when she said she hoped I could have a companion one day, I felt she was doing it for my own good and hoped I could experience the happiness she experienced. Of course, some people may feel stressed or nosy about this. And in Japan, some sexual orientations are not recognized and can be married, so I can&#39;t say that this is completely well-intentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, I think it&#39;s best not to take your parents&#39; words too seriously, just listen to their opinions from time to time, but don&#39;t take them too seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Now that I am really 40 years old, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;but &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;not much has changed&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As expressed in the Chinese word &quot;forty without confusion&quot;, it seems that people of this age will understand There are many principles, such as how to treat others and how to fight for rights and interests. You mentioned in &quot;Flowers for Love and the Womb&quot; that when you were about thirty years old, you discovered that the few people who stayed in Tokyo were not only friends, but also survivors. When you were forty, did you have a similar realization? A certain idea that seems natural actually changes quietly with age. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suzuki Ryomi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was a teenager or 20 years old, I imagined that I would know clearly when I was 40 years old. No matter what you want to do or what you don’t want to do, your relationship with others will be stable. But now that I&#39;m actually forty, I feel like I haven&#39;t changed much. I still wanted a lot of things, still lacked confidence in myself, and still worried about what others thought of me. I didn’t grow much. At least work-wise, though, I have more experience than I had in my twenties, so I have more concrete ideas about what I want to do in the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;So, when communicating with younger girls , do you feel the generational difference obviously? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suzuki Ryomi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Sometimes I feel there is no difference, and sometimes I feel it is completely different. Overall, young girls today are much more docile, kind, classy and mature than they were when we were young. But at the same time, they don’t have that much energy to do stupid things when they are young. Perhaps it is because Japan&#39;s economy has been in recession for a long time and people are full of uncertainty about the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said in &quot;Starting from the Limit&quot;, &quot;Standing at the limit, I look at things from where I am.&quot; Are there any recent changes or shifts in the “limits” of how you view the world? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suzuki Ryomi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I may be a pessimist, a realist at best, a cynic at worst, so I had a habit from the beginning of limiting my expectations, assuming that things were never going to change no matter what. Society won&#39;t change anyway, so let&#39;s enjoy freedom as much as possible in this society, etc. However, for example, the issue of sexual assault has recently begun to be widely reported in Japan, which was unimaginable twenty years ago.

I think there should be social security for people who have problems after leaving the night world. Indeed, some people enter the night world at an early age and have no choice. The best social security is to give them the opportunity to receive a proper education, regardless of the circumstances of their birth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can you imagine an ideal relationship between the sexes?

Change slowly and flexibly? When you want to use one word to describe the male gaze, you can actually imagine a lot of things. For example, when dividing the roles that women play for men into different categories, I think it is masculine: mother, wife, coworker, mistress , prostitutes, students, etc. When a woman has several attributes at the same time, many people will be very angry. For example, when a colleague is a mistress or his wife is a prostitute, it often scares men. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Finally, could you introduce your current work progress? ?

What a coincidence is that on November 12, 2018, five years ago, Wu Dajing won the Men’s Short Track Speed ​​Skating World Cup Salt Lake City Station in the 2018-2019 season. In the 500-meter final, he won the championship with a time of 39.505 seconds, breaking his own world record set at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in February 2018.

In 2023, he participated in some domestic competitions and will continue to participate in other competitions next year and beyond. What he is most worried about is the recurrence of old injuries, like an elusive bomb.

After the game, he and Fan Kexin hugged each other tightly. As the oldest athletes in the men&#39;s and women&#39;s teams, they have both experienced three Olympic Games. &quot;At that moment, we really understood each other with just one look.

At some point, I feel that otherwise I will quit. Because no matter from the perspective of Neither my physical condition nor my age condition is in the best state, so I weighed and compared myself, but in the end I still felt that I couldn’t let it go. Skating has always been my passion. As an athlete, I have been engaged in my favorite industry for so many years. It doesn&#39;t mean that you can just let it go. For me now, it&#39;s easy to persist, but it&#39;s not easy to let go.&quot; Wu Dajing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dajing has created many histories of short track speed skating in China and is called the &quot;King of Sprints&quot; by the International Skating Union. He is the first Chinese men&#39;s Olympic gold medal in ice racing and the first Chinese men&#39;s Olympic gold medal in short track speed skating. At the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, he won the championship with a time of 39.584 seconds, breaking the world record and Olympic record, and won the first and only gold medal for the Chinese team at the Winter Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From being a sparring partner for the women’s team to becoming a world champion, he described it as “every time he breaks through and challenges himself.” Today, in the face of this new journey, different from the past, he needs to challenge his mentality. Well, the results are not the only important thing for me. The moment the athletes were on the court, in fact, it was to prove that I got good results, but now I love it more, so I use a better mentality to come. Ready, maybe it will be better.

A simple shed was spontaneously setting fire inside, in order to warm up. &quot;Such training venues, there are no board walls outside, parents use snow to pile a protective wall to prevent children from falling out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When the price of ice shoes is relatively expensive, it usually buys a bigger, and the feet are painful. They often bleed and crust, and repeatedly. &quot;But when I was young, I didn&#39;t feel bitter. (Even) I felt that it was particularly comfortable on the ice rink, and I could put on the ice knife. I didn&#39;t feel cold at that time, but now I think it is really cold. I am particularly cold now. It&#39;s more frozen. &quot;Wu Dajing laughed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wu Dajing once said that he had a pair of &quot;ugly feet&quot;. He accumulated a &quot;bun&quot; because of the unsuccessful ice shoes and accumulated training, and even some places to deform in some places. &quot;I said that I must wear shoes in the future, and I must buy good shoes. The most sorry for my life in my life is my feet. I have been witnessing my journey for more than ten years. I am still eating with me. I often joke and say that I will have better to my feet in the future. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In 2019, Wu Dajing built a public welfare ice rink in Jiamusi, Heilongjiang, Heilongjiang, to support my hometown. The short track career, the &quot;wild ice rink&quot; trained when he was a child, hopes to give children more training venues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Today, when this charity ice rink is in winter, there are particularly many people, children, and skating enthusiasts, and they spontaneously organize to maintain the ice rink. &quot;I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t have Bai Jian. Many people use it. Children, elderly people, and young people can skate here. I think it is a very meaningful thing to help more people.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Sutling in public welfare also makes Wu Dajing happy. After he won the first gold in the Beijing Winter Olympics, he got a golden pier and hugged it to sleep. However, on the day of closing, he decided to auction this Jintun and donated the good money to the &quot;Hope Project · Dajing Ice and Snow Public Welfare Program&quot; to create the conditions for ice and snow sports for the rural youth. He felt, &quot;We can see the effect to help others. This is its significance to maximize it.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms//cms/ Medias/Image/23/11/21/MWJ2D93PXUCO5QS2C5BFLHYQCGSU4RKODSURFTEA.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;head =&quot; 657 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzmm .com/cms/Medias/Image/23/// 11/21/MWJ2d93PXuCo5qs2C5bFLHyQCGSu4rKoDSURFtea.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258964&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2022年2月5日，在北京2022年冬In the Olympic short track speed skating project&#39;s hybrid group relay final, the Chinese team won the championship.

For many years, I haven&#39;t accompanied their parents to spend the Spring Festival and have not accompanied them to live a good time for a while.

Many &quot;witty comments&quot; have become new &quot;network stalks&quot;. For example, the comments of the Chinese People&#39;s Public Security University &quot;Gathering is a fire, and it is a police station.&quot; &quot;, Changsha University of Technology&quot; E -sports 985, Rap 211 &quot;, and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The public opinion field is more reported by the &quot;college score&quot;. There is no reason for him. This &quot;college score&quot; is an evaluation from the perspective of a student. &quot;University Rankings&quot;. On the occasion of public opinion and carnival, there are also some problems worthy of analysis: What kind of &quot;college evaluation&quot; is credible? What kind of &quot;college evaluation&quot; do we need? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are always many outside universities Zang Yuedan, and the evaluation forms are also diverse: from the various universities of independent institutions, to the peers to the professional list, and then to the business community or formal or official or official or formal or formal Private evaluation is not enough. However, there are few evaluations that can satisfy everyone, and there is no set of &quot;ranking&quot; or &quot;list&quot; that can destroy the controversy. The reason is naturally the difference between the evaluation subject and the evaluation standard, and the right and wrong of the selection procedure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to cater to various &quot;university rankings&quot;, Chinese and foreign universities have also tried their best. For example, in order to improve the rating of domestic universities, international students are recruited regardless of the quality of students; many of European and American pheasant colleges have also carried out many marketing operations to attract international students. The result is that the criteria for evaluation of these rankings are not only one -sided, but some of them can&#39;t stand on their own, but the credibility of the damage institution itself. For colleges and universities, the swollen face is insufficient, and the appropriate performance is not enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Even the &quot;look fair&quot; statistics such as teachers and scientific research quality are not always fair and reasonable in reality. &quot;One -foot&quot; response strategy. For example, in the ranking of mathematical disciplines announced by USNews in 2021, Qufu Normal University surpassed the ranking of Peking University, which surprised the industry. However, its output process is &quot;reasonable and well -founded&quot;, and it is exactly the method of &quot;thesis irrigation&quot; and &quot;self -introduction in the school&quot;. However, it is self -evident how much such an evaluation standard is in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In recent years, Chinese and foreign universities have all have various dissatisfaction sounds, and the &quot;exit ranking&quot; action has risen. In 2022, the National People&#39;s Congress, NTU, and Lan University withdrew the rankings of the World University, announcing that they would no longer provide data and were not led by the &quot;foreign indicators&quot; with their noses. In November 2022, Yale University School of Law publicly announced the withdrawal from the &quot;US NEWS American University Ranking&quot;, on the grounds that it ranked &quot;serious defects&quot; and the institution itself was &quot;profit&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Back to the &quot;college score&quot;. On the surface, &quot;college scores&quot; are like &quot;Public Comment&quot;, &quot;Taobao Rating&quot; and &quot;Douban Rating&quot;. They belong to the &quot;quality assessment&quot; of consumers for merchants, but college students have a little more subjective random random rating of colleges and universities. In essence, this &quot;university score&quot; activity can be called &quot;pulling stepping on each other&quot;, &quot;anti -string black&quot;, &quot;high -level black&quot; and &quot;self -black&quot; extension, which can be regarded as an alternative &quot;college evaluation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Because of this, students in this mountain will be affected by the &quot;observer effect&quot; after all, after all, it is impossible to be completely objective and fair. In this &quot;Tiger Flutter University Rating&quot;, there are comments such as &quot;the alma mater is not good, and you have to give a full score&quot;. There are also many comments and scores that are realized &quot;just like music&quot;. For example, Tsinghua University&#39;s score is only 5 There are many points, and the hot review is also the entertainment discourse of &quot;feeling school -like&quot;, so &quot;voicing&quot; is obviously not too serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the &quot;tiger flutter college score&quot; that triggered public opinion carnival is destined to be only a kind of &quot;college evaluation&quot;. : The evaluation subject is diversified, the evaluation standards are changing, and the evaluation procedures are different. Let any form of college evaluation can only have a reference value within a certain range, rather than the golden family jade law that everyone wants to follow. Digging the mind matching some specific &quot;ranking&quot; and &quot;list&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So what is good college evaluation? In short, what can be considered a good school? The assessment of colleges and universities has long been evaluated for thousands of faces, and good schools do not rely on one or two good rankings to become good schools. Except for the indicators that are often used in the evaluation, the quality of student sources, alumni achievements, interbank certification, and employment market recognition are difficult to shake. The true indicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The so -called &quot;teacher -solid apprenticeship, and apprentice also choose a teacher&quot;, as well as the relationship between universities and students. The school and the students are two -way choices. The school rankings are essentially the ranking of students. Most of the evaluations of the enterprise community also stem from the evaluation of graduates, which only derives the level difference between colleges and universities. After all, major colleges and universities are not selected by any of them on the shelves, nor is it a music/movie/game that everyone can buy experience. The student groups of colleges and universities are often selected by colleges and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the writer Fang Long, a scholar said that he invented a great truth and had to teach his knowledge to others. As a result, a group of young people gathered around him, and the university was born. It was originally a consortium of professors and students. &quot;Learning Solidarity&quot; is the background of the university, and it is also the starting point of all evaluations. The &quot;college score&quot; this time has not lost to pay tribute to the ancient tradition. At least, compared to the ranking of the university, colleges and universities should first listen to the voices of students and alumni. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[上海实业集团总裁周军被查，曾三度任600亿医药龙头董事长]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261012]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-21 14:14:03 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; On the evening of November 20, the official WeChat public account of the Shanghai Discipline Inspection Commission &quot;Integrity Shanghai&quot; posted a message saying that Shanghai Industrial (Group) President Zhou Jun is suspected of serious disciplinary violations and is currently undergoing disciplinary review and supervision investigation by the Shanghai Discipline Inspection Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/e12e777726fd064b3561b927b9.png&quot; 0 &quot;0&quot; 0 &quot;opac it: 1; &quot;width =&quot; 1552 &quot;height =&quot; 610 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/E73A810EA77726B3561B927B9.PNG &quot;Data-key = &quot;258989&quot;>; &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; On the same day, Shanghai Pharmaceutical (601607.SH) also issued an announcement.
