(hereinafter referred to as &quot;Central Huijin&quot;) increased its A-share holdings. It has been eight years since Central Huijin last increased its holdings in the four major banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the closing price on October 11, Central Huijin’s increase in its holdings in the four major banks was approximately 477 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to announcements from the four major banks, this increase in holdings is just the beginning. Central Huijin will continue to increase holdings in the secondary market in its own name in the next 6 months (counting from the date of this increase in holdings). The four major banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Central Huijin is a wholly state-owned company established in 2003. It has strong capital strength and holds shares in nearly 20 leading companies in four major categories, including banking, insurance, securities, and comprehensive institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This increase in holdings of the four major banks is of great significance to insiders in the securities industry. It sends a positive signal of stabilizing the capital market. It is also expected to drive bank stocks back to the main line of China Special Assessment, and then achieve the rhythm of the sector. Large with small, the floor pushes the ceiling. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Operation again after 8 years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 11, Agricultural Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank collectively announced that the controlling shareholders Central Huijin increased its A-share holdings by 37.2722 million shares, 27.61 million shares, 24.8879 million shares and 18.38 million shares, and planned to increase its A-share holdings in the next 6 months (from the date of this increase). It continued to increase its holdings of the Bank’s shares in the secondary market in its own name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How much is the amount of this increase? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the closing price on October 11, the four major banks increased their holdings by a total of 477 million yuan. Among them, the highest is 136 million yuan from Agricultural Bank of China, followed by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with 130 million yuan, China Construction Bank with approximately 117 million yuan, and Bank of China with 94 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time Central Huijin increased capital for the four major banks was in 2015, at a total cost of nearly 20 billion yuan. In 2015, Central Huijin increased its holdings in Agricultural Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank by 1.255 billion shares, 1.014 billion shares, 1.810 billion shares, and 497 million shares respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has also led some market participants to predict that Central Huijin’s increase in its holdings in the four major banks is only the beginning, and the proportion of subsequent holdings may be further increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Central Huijin has strong financial strength. According to the 2023 semi-annual report, its total assets and net assets are as high as 6.71 trillion yuan and 6.21 trillion yuan respectively. Its operating performance is also remarkable, with operating income of 323.615 billion yuan and operating profit of 316.607 billion yuan in the first half of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Affect geometry? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Central Huijin has increased its holdings in the four major banks, and its market impact cannot be underestimated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yifeng, chief financial analyst at Everbright Securities, said that Huijin’s increase in holdings sends a positive signal to stabilize the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the four major banks have stable profits and high dividend rates, but they are at very low valuation levels. Huijin&#39;s increase in holdings demonstrates the controlling shareholder&#39;s confidence in state-owned financial institutions with low valuations and high dividends; secondly, the four major banks have a larger weight in the Shanghai Composite Index, and continued increase in holdings is expected to have net-breaking valuations but stable operations and dividends Companies with high profitability will form support, which will help boost market confidence; finally, the four major banks play the role of &quot;lead goose&quot; in credit extension, and this increase in holdings will also help convey confidence in the stability of my country&#39;s financial system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Ma Kunpeng, chief analyst of CITIC Securities Bank, this will drive bank stocks back to the main line of China Special Assessment, and then achieve large and small stocks, and the floor will push the ceiling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, he believes that the four major banks are the cornerstone of the banking sector and have key guiding significance for the overall prosperity of the sector. They are also the core of the banking industry’s valuation system with Chinese characteristics. They are important for today’s increase in holdings and The proactive announcement of the willingness to increase holdings in the future and the entry of real money into the market are not only an overall support for the banking sector, but also a high degree of affirmation of the special valuation of banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It suggested that we should attach great importance to the systematic revaluation of the banking sector starting from the special valuation of major banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kunpeng regards the special valuation of major state-owned banks as a systematic revaluation supported by real logic and believes that it has three major logical pillars: First, the risks of major state-owned banks in key areas such as real estate and urban investment Not high, significantly better than the industry average; secondly, historical bad debt has been completely cleared, and the full-caliber bad debt rate has fully reflected and digested the bad debt implied by the current valuation, and has peaked; furthermore, the ROE of major banks has been at the bottom, promoting The profit growth rate at the critical point of ROE recovery is very close to the current profit growth rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kunpeng believes that on the one hand, the current macro economy is at a critical turning point for stabilization and improvement, and the macro turning point is more beneficial to major banks that are more biased towards sector beta. On the other hand, the main line logic of the special evaluation of major banks this year is also conducive to major banks taking the lead in performing. Therefore, unlike the previous rhythm of first anchoring the sector&#39;s ceiling valuation and then driving low valuations, this year&#39;s rhythm should be the opposite, first raising the sector&#39;s floor valuation and then pushing the ceiling higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我的一则班内社会学调查：为何现在的年轻人不喜欢回家了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258419]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A recent post is very popular. The original text says this, &quot;When you are helpless, you often have thoughts in your mind. I said &#39;I want to go home&#39;, but it seems that it is not the real &#39;home&#39; in reality, but a safe, comfortable place in my imagination, without pain and trouble.&quot; I estimate that the posters are most likely young people, and the people who post and comment on them are also mostly young. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Home, also known as home in English, is different from house, which is only a building with residential functions. Home is a word with obvious cultural and geographical color, often associated with family, family, affection, warmth, shelter, arms, harbor, etc. Going home, the so-called going home, is also full of positive energy, a sense of justice and legitimacy, such as &quot;go home often&quot;, &quot;rich or not, go home for the New Year&quot;, &quot;fallen leaves return to their roots&quot; and other popular This can be seen in the song titles or sentences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For me, I must go home during holidays, especially long holidays. The simple truth is that it was very difficult for my parents to raise and train me as an adult. Now that they are older, I have no reason not to take the time to go home to visit and accompany them. In other words, if I don’t go home during the holidays and only play by myself or play with my wife and children, I will feel guilty and feel that I am a selfish and heartless person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Times have changed, and today’s young people, especially those born in the 1990s and 2000s, have completely different understandings and perceptions of home and returning home. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;My sociological investigation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;My nephew is a freshman. During this past holiday, he only stayed at home for three days and asked his friends out on the fourth day. Have fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I randomly asked the 18 people I teach, including sophomores and juniors, 7 of them &quot;did not go home during this holiday&quot; and 7 of them &quot;stayed home for 7 days or more&quot;. 1 person, 3 people &quot;stayed home for 5-6 days&quot;, 4 people &quot;stayed home for 3-4 days&quot;, and 3 people &quot;stayed home for 1-2 days&quot;. Among the 7 people who did not go home, 5 people directly expressed that they &quot;didn&#39;t like going home&quot; and 2 people said that &quot;I had other arrangements during the holiday, so I didn&#39;t go home.&quot; Among the 11 students who went home, 92% held the view that they “like to go home, but don’t like to stay at home for too long.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One conclusion is that the young people I observed do not like to go home very much, or do not like to stay at home for too long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering returning home as a population movement phenomenon, even if it is a temporary population movement, we might as well borrow the push-pull theory of demography to explain: Going home proves that there is something attractive to me at home, which makes me Things that feel comfortable, this is the &quot;pull&quot;, pull me home; if I don&#39;t want to go home, don&#39;t go home, or want to leave home after a few days, there must be something I don&#39;t like at home that makes me feel The uncomfortable place, this is the &quot;thrust&quot;, pushing me away from home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For young people, what are the main components of the “pull” to go home? &quot;It&#39;s holiday, I want to go home and eat something delicious&quot;, &quot;Studying at school is too stressful, I want to go home and rest for a few days&quot;, &quot;I miss my parents and want to go home to spend a few days with them&quot;, &quot;They It’s not easy to support my studies, so I have to go home and spend time with them during the holidays.” The students generally gave their answers in terms of emotional expression and feedback, as well as self-repair and relaxation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are obviously many &quot;push&quot; components of not going home, not wanting to go home, and wanting to leave home soon after returning home. Here are some of the answers I got, and I divided them into categories according to the content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have other more important arrangements: &quot;I traveled with my boyfriend during the holidays. We went to Xi&#39;an to watch a concert, so I didn&#39;t go home.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to save money ’s: “If I don’t go home, I can save a lot of money. For example, if I stay at school for eight days, I can get it for 500 yuan, but the high-speed rail ticket alone costs more than 500 yuan for me to go home. Not going home is a big deal for me. A kind of financial savings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who feel that there are communication barriers with their parents, cannot talk together, or feel that they are not free and uncomfortable: &quot;Communicating with parents is obviously not as pleasant as communicating with roommates or peers. , my real sense of gain is also much different.&quot; &quot;I want to relax when I go home, such as watching a movie with my friends. I like to put on makeup before going out. My mother likes to keep asking, who are I with and what are I doing? , What time will you go home? I’m very annoyed by it. I feel like I don’t have any freedom at home. I don’t like this feeling.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most common ones are those who have thoughts about their parents’ thoughts, or want to get rid of their parents’ judgment on their own lives: “It was fine for the first two days when I went home. I ate the food cooked by my mother. I was very happy and relaxed, but Later, my parents, especially my dad, always asked me about my life plans and future plans, which made me feel even more stressed.&quot; &quot;As soon as I came back, my dad kept nagging me in my ears to take the postgraduate entrance examination and public entrance examination. , saying that a certain job has security and will be relatively stable in the future, and that that job is not good and has no future, etc., &quot;My mother gave me some instructions on how to find a boyfriend, telling me not to find a boyfriend in such and such a place, but to find a fellow villager. I&#39;m about to collapse.&quot; &quot;In the eyes of my parents, I am always a child. Once my ideas are inconsistent with theirs, they will think that I am disobedient, rebellious, and unfilial, and they will criticize me and scold me. &quot;I don&#39;t like this.&quot; &quot;My dad is a local teacher in our area. He wants me to return to my hometown to be a teacher after graduation, which will be stable and relaxing. The problem is that I don&#39;t want to go home, and I don&#39;t want to be a teacher.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that among the various elements of &quot;push&quot; in the eyes of the students, the differences in ideological concepts and lifestyles between the two generations, parental authority, and (excessive) control of children&#39;s rights to free development and self-determination Intervention is the most obvious manifestation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the acquisition and growth of students from professional fields has also made the parent-child relationship relatively tense, and conflicts or contradictions have become apparent. Some students said, &quot;I am studying sociology. I have a certain theoretical understanding of power asymmetry and discipline. When I went home and heard what my parents said to me, I clearly felt that their words were full of PUA, and their words and deeds reflected obvious power discipline. The traces of what I learned in school are vividly reproduced in my home, and this feeling makes me extremely distressed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, some students also pay attention to strategies when communicating or confronting their parents. One student mentioned, “When my parents talk about topics I don’t want to talk about, such as finding a partner, my The strategy is usually to use other topics to divert the topic. I will say that I am very busy, I have to study, I have to study, I have no time to fall in love, etc. to prevaricate them. I generally do not have head-on or direct conflicts with them, and I will selectively avoid them. Something I don’t want to talk about”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the &quot;push&quot; is greater than or significantly greater than the &quot;pull&quot;, the realistic choice for young people is naturally that they don&#39;t really want to go home, or they want to leave home after they can&#39;t stay home for a few days. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“It’s okay to go home; it’s not okay to stay for a long time”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, most young people will not resist going home, but they are limited by the differences in thoughts and concepts between generations. , there are obvious differences in the understanding and cognition of some things and problems, which often leads to some problems when young people and their parents stay under the same roof for a long time. Young people have the mentality of doing more than doing less, so they choose not to Go home, or go home less often, or reduce the number of days you stay at home. In a nutshell, &quot;It&#39;s okay to go home; it&#39;s not okay to stay for a long time.&quot; This is the choice of most young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the students I surveyed, regarding the frequency or probability of going home during the holidays, I observed: It seems that young people who were born and grew up in a good family or a wealthy family have a relatively low frequency, and those who think they are in a higher position have a lower frequency. Parents who are powerful or well-connected will have more future expectations and life plans and designs for their children. They are more likely to overstep their authority and suppress and restrain their children more frequently. The latter will certainly be more uncomfortable and less free. A classmate said, &quot;My dad always talks in a bossy and arrogant way. I hate it. &#39;You must take the postgraduate entrance examination&#39;, &#39;You must take the public examination&#39;, &#39;You don&#39;t need to spend time putting on makeup&#39;, &#39;You don&#39;t &quot;I always go out to drink&quot;, &quot;I have eaten more salt than you have traveled&quot;, &quot;If you don&#39;t listen to the old man&#39;s words, you will suffer a lot&quot;, I feel annoyed when I hear these words.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, for those families with average economic conditions, after the children come home, the main thing for the parents is to cook for the children and have fun with the children. The atmosphere is relatively harmonious, and the communication topics are not involved or rarely involved. Children&#39;s future, children&#39;s real feeling is that they are comfortable and comfortable, and they feel no or little pressure. The holidays are real companionship for them, and they fulfill the original meaning of the holidays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In real life, there are still a small number of young people who don’t like to go home. They have fierce arguments with their parents as soon as they come home. They show contempt for their parents. Even when they go home, they are locked up. They go out to watch movies and play games without any verbal or other communication with their parents. For families with average or poor economic conditions, some young people turn a blind eye to the objective fact that their parents save money on food and clothing to support their education and college. They think this is what parents should do and it is a matter of course. &quot;I am Your children, it is only natural that I spend your money.&quot; In their view, parents are synonymous with old traditions, old ideas, decadence and backwardness. Their strategy is usually to &quot;not work together if they have different paths&quot;, that is, to &quot;cut off the relationship&quot; in an absolute sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, such children are not grateful to their parents for their upbringing. Faced with such a child, the other parent naturally feels disheartened and laments that his fate is bad and his family is unfortunate enough to have raised such a child. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Problems with parenting styles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Not to mention &quot;raising children for old age&quot;, parents work hard to cultivate and support their children. As children, we must have a basic sense of gratitude. Bar? Why is it missing? What is the problem? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the root lies in parents and their training methods. Many parents think that the standard of a good parent is to provide their children with basic or relatively superior material living conditions. I will try my best to satisfy my children&#39;s needs. This is even what good parents are all about, but this is not the case. In the process of raising and educating their children, parents cannot stop at purely financial support, but also involve all aspects, such as the source of value and the arduous process of creating value. Parents are too doting on their children. They have always known to give and give away since they were young. Children, let them feel that the material conditions they have are taken for granted, and do not instill in them values ​​such as a sense of responsibility, equality of rights and obligations, and the other side of freedom is self-responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As children, they never know or understand how difficult it is for their parents to make money. Their parents do not give their children the opportunity to experience and appreciate the hardship of their parents making money. Another example is paying attention to the inner world of children and the psychological changes during their growth. Many parents think that it is enough to feed and clothe their children, but they seldom pay attention, care and concern to their children&#39;s spiritual world and spiritual life. They seldom pay attention to, respect and listen to children&#39;s way of thinking and ideas. This is a common problem in so-called &quot;East Asian families&quot;. The common point is that both parties only focus on or care about material supply and acceptance, and do not care about each other&#39;s psychology. State, especially no or very little attention to the other person&#39;s mental state and personality traits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the solution to similar problems, from an economic perspective, when young people grow up and become adults, they theoretically have their own economic and behavioral capabilities. Shouldn&#39;t they completely &quot;cut off the relationship&quot;? Okay, is it okay for you to support yourself now? Then repay me all the fees I paid you after you turned 18, and then talk about &quot;breaking up the relationship&quot;. This may sound harsh, but it is the truth. Parents are adults, and their children are also adults, so they should get along with each other according to the contract in the adult world. If you borrow something, of course you have to repay it. This is only natural. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the question of whether young people are willing to go home, how often they go home, and how many days they stay home essentially refers to the relationship between young people and their parents. Young people and their parents have different values, different cultural levels, different starting points, and different life experiences, which will inevitably lead to different views and opinions. This is a normal phenomenon. In the process of communication or getting along, both parties should adhere to the basic principle of empathy, consider issues from the other party&#39;s perspective, respect the other party more, care more about the other party, especially respect and care about the other party&#39;s inner feelings and experiences, and advocate effective communication between the two parties. and communication to gradually resolve or eliminate the inner barriers and gaps between each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those &quot;rebellious children&quot; or &quot;parasites&quot; who only know how to take without knowing anything in return or feedback, I think parents can consider reducing or even stopping the material support for their children. In the past, they only focused on the material aspects of their children. Conduct in-depth examination and reflection on the parenting methods that focus on life but neglect the spiritual world of children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, I would like to return to a concept from the perspective of anthropology - making a home. The corresponding English word is home making, which means that home is not natural or naturally generated. Home is more than just a physical level. It refers more to the social level. Home is the result of social construction. Home requires the joint efforts of parents and children to build, build and operate. Only parents and children adopt common behaviors, actions, consultations and Only through collaboration can a true home be formed, and only then can the home in young people&#39;s imagination truly exist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大熊猫野化放归，都要上啥“培训课”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258425]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/12/482c666bae28b65adc021eac7d29f4cd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/12/482c666bae28b65adc021eac7d29f4cd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253799&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The Giant Panda National Park has beautiful scenery.

Photo courtesy of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Driving from the urban area of ​​Dujiangyan, Sichuan, along the winding winding mountain road to the west, after driving for more than an hour, we arrived at the China Giant Panda Conservation Research Institute Center (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Panda Center&quot;) Wolong Hetaoping Base. The climate here is cool, rainy and humid, and it is located in the natural living environment of giant pandas. It is very suitable for wild training and captive breeding of giant pandas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reintroduction of captive giant pandas into the wild is a key technology pioneered by the Panda Center, which is mainly divided into the stages of reintroduction training, release and monitoring. Over the years, generations of scientific researchers have devoted a lot of effort to establish a complete technical system for giant panda wild training and reintroduction monitoring, which has achieved good results in practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why should giant pandas be reintroduced into the wild? What significance does this have for the protection of the giant panda population? From captivity to release, what &quot;training courses&quot; do giant pandas need to take? Recently, reporters conducted on-site visits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/3acb8beb101d736d5a5f6e17e6c8354f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/3acb8beb101d736d5a5f6e17e6c8354f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253798&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Researchers conduct a health check-up on a giant panda cub.

In the rewilding training area of ​​​​Hetaoping Base, except for a path that the staff walked up and down the mountain, there are almost no traces of human activities, and the original ecology is preserved. In order not to disturb the silence, the reporter turned his cell phone to silent and walked in quietly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the dense jungle, giant panda &quot;Bosi&quot; and his cub are sleeping soundly. Not far away, keepers in &quot;panda suits&quot; were using this time to clean the pens and replenish fresh bamboo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In order to mask the human smell, the &#39;panda suit&#39; is sprayed with extracts of panda feces and urine.&quot; He Shengshan, director of the Field Research Animal Management Department of the Hetaoping Base, told reporters that unlike captive giant pandas, the The breeders are close to and dependent on them, and the breeders trained in the wild must remain &quot;invisible&quot; at all times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reintroduction into the wild is an important means to rehabilitate and rebuild the wild population of giant pandas, and is of great significance to the protection of giant pandas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, my country has vigorously implemented natural forest protection, wildlife protection projects and the construction of giant panda national parks to protect giant pandas and their habitats, with remarkable results. The results of the fourth national giant panda survey show that the number of wild giant pandas has increased from 1,114 in the 1970s and 1980s to 1,864, distributed in Qinling, Minshan, Qionglai Mountain, Daxiangling, Xiaoxiangling, Liangshan, etc. Six major mountain systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, natural geographical barriers isolate these wild giant pandas in six major mountain systems, and human activities have divided these six major habitat populations into small local populations that cannot interact with each other. &quot;Habitat fragmentation has resulted in the inability of genetic exchange between isolated populations, reducing the genetic diversity of small local populations and accelerating the disappearance of endangered small populations,&quot; said Wu Daifu, director of the Hetaoping base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To save a species, the integrity and stability of the community in which it is located and the genetic diversity within the species must be protected. &quot;Currently, the main measures taken to protect giant pandas in our country are in-situ protection and ex-situ protection.&quot; Wu Daifu said that the connection point between the two methods is to release giant pandas bred in captivity after rewilding training. Return to small endangered populations in the wild, thereby improving their genetic diversity, reducing the risk of extinction, and reviving the wild giant panda population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As global breeding problems such as difficulty in mating and conceiving and raising young to survive have been overcome, artificial breeding of giant pandas has achieved fruitful results, and the captive giant panda population has achieved self-sustainment. In 2003, the Panda Center launched the training and reintroduction of captive-bred giant pandas into the wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2006, the male sub-adult giant panda &quot;Xiang Xiang&quot; was released into the wild after independent rewilding training. However, less than a year later, workers found its body in the snow. After analysis and judgment, &quot;Xiangxiang&quot; fell from a height and was seriously injured and died during a fight with a wild giant panda for territory and food. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Panda Center summarized the failed rewilding case of &quot;Xiang Xiang&quot; and believed that maybe it was the lack of suitable learning objects that led to the lack of survival ability of &quot;Xiang Xiang&quot; in the wild; maybe it was because the population in the reintroduction area was saturated, and &quot;Xiang Xiang&quot; was not able to survive in the wild. &quot;Lack of enough living space; the competition for territory and mates among adult male giant pandas in the wild is extremely fierce. &quot;Xiangxiang&quot; may not have enough fighting experience and cannot resist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sum up experience and make persistent efforts. In 2010, with the stable growth of the captive giant panda population, the Panda Center launched the second phase of the captive giant panda rewilding training project, and proposed for the first time a new rewilding training method of &quot;mother animals raising cubs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/c89176807e0a5e9d5b83652545c85998.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;403&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/c89176807e0a5e9d5b83652545c85998.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253797&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The giant panda &quot;Qin Xin&quot; was released into the wild. Photo by He Haiyang&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Helping giant panda cubs learn wild survival skills as soon as they are born&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“At 1:16 in the morning, the cub screamed, &quot;The mother lay on her side to protect her cub&quot; &quot;At 4:53 am, the mother adjusted her sleeping position to protect her cub&quot; &quot;At 8 am, the mother ate 9 bamboos in the morning and drank water twice. The cub screamed loudly and defecated once, but there were no abnormalities.&quot; ...In the monitoring room of the Hetaoping base, the work log of the keepers records in detail the daily activities of the giant panda &quot;Hui Hui&quot; and her newborn cubs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are 4 giant panda cubs in the first stage of rewilding training at the Hetaoping Base: &quot;Zhichun Zai&quot; and &quot;Bosi Zai&quot; who are over 1 years old, and two newborn cubs . &quot;All organs of newly born giant panda cubs are not fully developed. We must always pay attention to them and conduct video surveillance around the clock, and take timely measures if any abnormality occurs,&quot; said breeder Zhang Dalei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the growth and behavioral development characteristics of giant pandas, rewilding training is divided into two stages. From birth to about 1 year old, in a small training circle of about 2,000 square meters, the cubs eat breast milk. ; From about 1 year old to before release, in a large training circle of 200,000-300,000 square meters, the cubs gradually learn to eat bamboo independently. The large-scale training enclosure is located in the wild habitat environment of giant pandas, where there are tall trees, dense bamboo forests and complex terrain, in a completely natural state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on long-term practice and research, the Panda Center creatively implements &quot;mother animals raising cubs&quot; training. &quot;From birth, the cubs live with their mothers and gradually learn survival skills such as foraging for food, finding water sources, and avoiding natural enemies in nature. In the past, breeders could not teach pandas to climb trees in a few days. Now panda mothers use their mouths to climb trees. Just push the baby up the tree, and the panda baby will learn to climb the tree twice.&quot; He Shengshan said that giant pandas can be released into the wild only after completing a series of training and undergoing expert evaluation. &quot;At this time, two or three-year-old pandas will learn to climb trees. Giant pandas are in the post-weaning and pre-adult stage, and as sub-adults, it is easier to integrate into the wild giant panda population.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The selection of female animals is very particular. &quot;It is best for the mother animal to be a multi-parous giant panda with experience in wild life, or an individual with strong ability to raise young.&quot; He Shengshan said that at the same time, the body of the mother animal must be kept in good health, and factors such as age and genetic background must also be considered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid &quot;imprinting behavior&quot; in giant panda cubs, the impact of human activities must be minimized. &quot;Every time the female panda is fed food, the keeper will put on a &#39;panda suit&#39; to prevent the cubs from becoming dependent on humans.&quot; Zhang Dalei said that pandas should be made to avoid humans as soon as they sense humans instead of actively approaching them. Only then can they return to the jungle smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to feeding food, cleaning the enclosures, etc., keepers are also responsible for observing and recording the growth, development and behavioral performance of giant pandas, such as the time of first walking, first climbing, first eating bamboo, etc. Since 2012, Zhang Dalei has raised 7 giant pandas for rewilding training. &quot;Although the work is hard and tiring, as long as they return to the wild and live a healthy life, I will feel a sense of accomplishment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Accompanying giant pandas all year round is an enviable job, but it also contains risks and challenges that few people know about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In summer, mudslides often occur in the mountains, and the wild training circle is often put to the test. &quot;The mudslide that occurred on August 20, 2019, was less than 100 meters away from the cabin where we were resting. The situation at that time was very thrilling.&quot; He Shengshan still has lingering fears. Encountering wild animals in the wild is also common. &quot;Wild boars, snakes, etc. are often encountered in the mountains. Only by accumulating rich experience and being fully prepared can we avoid danger again and again,&quot; He Shengshan said. Now, he and his colleagues always make prevention plans in advance, bring enough supplies before going up the mountain, and carry satellite phones with them to ensure smooth communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researcher Wei Hua almost lost his life while training giant pandas in the wild. In December 2016, the cub &quot;Baxi&quot; who was trained in Tiantai Mountain was close to the age of release, but no sign of &quot;Baxi&quot; was found for two consecutive days. Wei Hua and his colleagues were very worried and entered the training circle to search, but found no trace of him. Thinking of being attacked and seriously injured by the giant panda mother &quot;Ximei&quot; who was eager to protect her cubs. Even so, Wei Hua still believes: &quot;&#39;Ximei&#39; biting me shows that it is wild and maternal. This is exactly the goal we pursue when releasing giant pandas into the wild.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src= &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/6b7edb5080465fd325ad27a55d763969.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;556&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/6b7edb5080465fd325ad27a55d763969.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253800&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999 ; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Giant panda mother teaches her cub to climb a tree.

In 2018, giant pandas &quot;Qin Xin&quot; and &quot;Little Walnut&quot; were released into the Longxi Hongkou National Nature Reserve in Dujiangyan City, located in the Minshan Mountains, after undergoing wild training and scientific evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to monitor the survival status of giant pandas after they are released? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Hao said that when giant pandas are released, they will be put on an electronic collar that can be tracked and monitored, and their movement trajectory, health status and other information will be tracked through satellite signals. &quot;However, the collar It will fall off in about a year and a half, and long-term tracking and monitoring cannot be carried out. We must rely on infrared cameras, feces sampling and other methods to collect more data.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wherever the giant panda is, we will follow it.&quot; Xie Hao He said that the monitoring team members searched for giant panda feces in the deep mountains and old forests, recorded relevant detailed information, and analyzed the giant pandas&#39; gender, age, population, and genetic relationships by extracting DNA. &quot;In the mountains and valleys, we often walk for more than half a month, resting wherever we catch up at night. Sometimes we can&#39;t keep up with food supplies, and we have to go hungry.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;November 2021, Dujiangyan During field monitoring, staff of the city&#39;s state-owned forest farm captured images of wild giant pandas through infrared cameras, which were suspected to be giant pandas released in 2018. A team of experts went to the site to inspect and collect fecal samples for further testing. Through the DNA extracted from it, it was determined that this female giant panda over 5 years old was the giant panda &quot;Little Walnut&quot; released in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/8900c1ccd18fd5129b1f27d7af40f4df.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/8900c1ccd18fd5129b1f27d7af40f4df.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253801&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Researchers use radio equipment to track and monitor the movements of giant pandas. Photo courtesy of China Giant Panda Conservation and Research Center&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Mingchun, deputy director of the Wild Ecology Research Office of the Panda Center, was excited when he saw the image of &quot;Little Walnut&quot;, &quot;This giant panda has a round body and a good mental state.&quot; Normal and living in good condition in the wild. When the DNA identification results confirmed that it was indeed &#39;Little Walnut&#39;, the rewilding training team was very excited. This showed that the rewilding training of &#39;Little Walnut&#39; for more than two years was successful. I hope it can be It thrives in the wild, and we look forward to finding a suitable husband, breeding offspring, and bringing us more surprises!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the Panda Center has released 11 captive-bred giant pandas, and 9 are still alive. , 7 of which were successfully integrated into the wild population of the Xiaoxiangling Mountain System that are at risk of extinction, and 2 were successfully integrated into the wild population of the Minshan Mountain System.放归的大熊猫中，有1雄4雌共5只已满6岁，处于可以繁殖的壮年阶段。 “放归大熊猫融入野生种群并且繁育后代，才能达到壮大野生种群的目的。但要找到放归大熊猫有后代的明确证据，需要耐心和时间。”吴代福表示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，我国正在构建国家公园天、空、地一体化监测体系。 “我们以此为契机，在大熊猫野化放归的区域内增加摄像头、红外相机等监测设备，提升大空间监测能力。”熊猫中心调查监测处处长杨建说，同时加强颈圈研发，努力提高电池使用寿命、提升定位精准度、实现录音实时回传，以掌握大熊猫野外动向等更多野外生存信息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们将通过种群的动态监测，评估遗传贡献。”杨建说，通过“猫脸识别”及DNA个体识别等技术，从大熊猫亲缘关系、年龄结构及遗传水平等方面开展动态监测，建立区域种群数量、结构和地理分布数据库，验证放归个体是否繁育后代。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴代福表示，将在大熊猫国家公园范围内，从遗传多样性、种群动态、群落特征及人类干扰等多方面，解析局域濒危小种群复壮受限制因素，科学制定规划，有序开展大熊猫放归，改善微小种群遗传多样性。同时，通过在生态廊道开展放归，增强种群间的基因连通性，为实现大熊猫种群的野外复壮提供关键支撑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，大熊猫野化培训梯队已经建立，未来每年将有培训合格的大熊猫个体放归野外，并努力复壮大熊猫小种群。 “我们将加快大熊猫野化培训、放归、监测等关键技术的创新和推广应用，力争每年放归大熊猫3至6只，并通过引种加大野生大熊猫濒危小种群资源保护，逐步建立野生大熊猫遗传种质资源库，实现圈养种群与野生种群基因双向交流。”吴代福说。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年10月7日，加沙城，巴勒斯坦武装分子向以色列发射火箭弹&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月7日起，巴勒斯坦抵抗组织哈马斯对巴以边境地带的以色列多个城市发动了复合偷袭，不仅发射了大量的火箭弹，同时还进行了猛烈地面攻击。根据目前统计，以色列方面至少有700人死于哈马斯的攻击，这是1973年赎罪日战争以来，以色列军民在战争中死伤最惨重的一次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列总理内塔尼亚胡向人民承诺将对哈马斯施以“可怕的复仇”，并宣布进入战争状态，这也是1973年赎罪日战争结束后以色列50年来第一次宣布进入战争状态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然本次袭击事发突然，但如此大规模的攻击事发前应该会有不少蛛丝马迹可循，拥有号称世界上最高效情报机构摩萨德的以色列，为何却未能提前预警呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在讨论这个问题之前，我们首先需要了解，巴以控制区内的情报工作在以色列的定位是国内安全业务，因此主要负责机构并不是赫赫有名的摩萨德（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;情报特务局&lt;/span>;），而是负责国内安保的辛贝特（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;国家安全局&lt;/span>;）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;辛贝特在加沙地带过去的工作一直被认为是低调且有效的，比如在“绿王子行动”中，他们曾成功策反哈马斯高层哈桑·尤素福的儿子摩萨卜·哈桑·尤素福，自1996年后的十多年里，通过他获得了大量来自哈马斯组织核心决策层的情报。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以色列之所以将巴以地区的主要情报工作划分给辛贝特，实际上是因为两地人员往来比较频繁，因此有很多行动和检查需要警察部门配合，而摩萨德主要负责对外情报和秘密行动，旗下人员与地方警力配合较少，并不利于无缝衔接。辛贝特除了对内反情报工作和反恐之外，还有要人及重要部门的警卫保护工作，与警察部门衔接紧密，显然更利于开展工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以真要追究对此次哈马斯突袭应对不力的责任，辛贝特难辞其咎，但归根结底，本次事件也暴露了以色列军警情报安全系统结构性的失败。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据一些内部人员向我提供的信息，这次以色列方面应对不力的主要原因有几点：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先是以色列从2022年开始的宪政危机，导致军警情报安全系统人心惶惶。内塔尼亚胡领导的右翼政府进行的司法改革，可能已经动摇了以色列民族团结的国本，导致有经验的情报人员和军警提前退休辞职，移民海外，在职人员也难免士气低落，削弱了整体的作战能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次是以色列内部治安最近一年多形势严峻，阿拉伯裔黑帮在街头仇杀枪战已经严重影响以色列的社会安全，导致辛贝特和警察部门疲于奔命，大量资源被用于应对有组织犯罪调查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外也有技术上的原因，近年来辛贝特和警方更倾向依赖信号情报和技术侦查，由于广泛的电子监听和空中侦察业务，以及大数据人工智能情报分析，能够获得远比过去更为海量的情报信息，并且自动化处理十分快捷。像“绿王子行动”这样古典的人工情报获取手段已成了“过时”的手艺，不再是工作重点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然信号情报近年来让以色列占尽优势，也符合情报工作的发展方向，但现在已经被哈马斯组织找到了应对的方法。由于加沙地带并不大，大量信息传递大可以通过原始的人传人方式逃避信号侦察，既然没有电子通信，再强大的监听技术也无用武之地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;造成现在的结果，对于以色列而言可以说是士气低落、人员流失、资源倾斜和对手进化等综合原因造成的。实际上情报工作的复杂性远远超出了外界的想象，有人用大海捞针来形容，其实并不准确，此类反恐情报工作更像是在一个充满针的大海中，找到那根有毒的针。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对手的反情报工作其实并不限于保密，同时也会放出大量真真假假的威胁信息以混淆视听，犹如不断喊“狼来了”的牧童，让人无所适从。这次以色列遭受重大损失，当然要追究情报和安全机构的责任，然而从专业角度审视，情报与反情报的对抗从未停止过。通过网络渗透、人工智能、大数据分析所获得的信号情报，并非未来军事、反恐的唯一方式，多手段侦察、多维度审视，才能降低战争迷雾的负面影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从费翔到蔡国庆，年轻一代为什么狂追“妈妈严选”男偶像？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258347]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/302c6f1c787a6b4c0b7f30a6519e0044.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;1987年，费翔以第一位回到祖国大陆的台湾歌手身份在中央电视台的春节联欢晚会上演唱歌曲《故乡的云》《冬天里的一把火》，一夜之间，费翔在大陆的人气达到巅峰。其洋气、开放、自由、奔放的形象、曲风&lt;/span>;和表演风格，让人耳目一新，也令千千万万的少女为之疯狂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;费翔一连在大陆发行多张专辑，张张火爆。1989年，费翔在中国大陆12个城市共举办了65场演唱会，中央电视台和中央新闻电影制片厂还专门拍成录影带和影片向全国播放。1990年费翔前往纽约，在百老汇发展，并成功转型为有扎实演唱功力的百老汇演员。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可以说，1980年代的费翔在国内的地位堪称顶流中的顶流，对于当时的观众来说，费翔&lt;span>;不仅仅是一个明星，他的身上更是承载着人们对于美好、未来与希望的想象，如同冬天里的一把火，照亮了很多人的生活。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1968年，蔡国庆出生，而且他年少就成名。7岁加入中央人民广播电台少儿合唱团，9岁出版首张唱片，1986年，蔡国庆参加第一届全国百名歌星演唱会，开始自己的歌唱生涯。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;两位“妈妈严选”都曾红极一时，只是在互联网时代和粉丝经济时代，他们的影响力更多局限于妈妈辈。这样的局面在这个夏天发生了改变，为何年轻人纷纷对“妈妈严选”上头了？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;首先是从明星的角度来看。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;当内娱捧出的&lt;/span>;许多年轻顶流，天价片酬、演技差、不敬业、私德不佳等丑闻一再暴露，“妈妈严选”的出现让年轻人发现：老一辈的艺人，是如此的自律、敬业、专业，这才是明星的榜样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果费翔饰演的殷寿没有立住，也就不会有《封神第一部》的成功。观众也在电影中看到了费翔的身材，那简直不像是一个六十多岁的中老年男性的身体，肌肉线条是如此分明，看不到赘肉的痕迹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要保持健康而良好的身材，离不&lt;span>;开自律。费翔一进组就严格控制饮食，进行马术&lt;/span>;、武术、健身等魔鬼训练，拍戏时间长达一年半时间，他的训练也持续一年半时间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;费翔业务能力很强，还非常敬业。早在2012年，他与乌尔善合作的《画皮II》上映，他就参与了《画皮II》的多次宣传，更是一人承担了电影在台湾的宣传。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一次《封神第一部》的路演&lt;span>;，29城、33天、170场，费翔29个城市路演都参与了，一共参与了164场路演，强度如此之大，他依然亲力亲为，奋战在第一线。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;威尼斯电影节，他一开始也是一个人代表了一整个剧组前往，在当地上映的《封神第一部》的英文字幕甚至是费翔通宵参与翻译的，第二天还要去出席活动……内娱如今有多少大小明星能够敬业到如此程度？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这一次蔡国庆参加了&lt;/span>;《披荆斩棘3》，很多人以为他会躺在功劳簿上睡大觉，蔡国庆却丝毫没有架子，没有包袱。初舞台上，他挑战了周杰伦的《Mojito》，让观众第一次如此清晰地听清这首歌的歌词，但蔡国庆的演唱也有别于周杰伦的风味，他的业务能力仍然在线。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后，无论是练歌还是练舞，蔡国庆都是保持积极昂扬充沛的精神状态，他努力、谦虚而清醒：“有突破后拿出有水准的作品，对我就是天大的好事；能得到今天观众的认&lt;span>;可，就是莫大鼓励。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;年轻人追捧“妈妈严选”，还有一个是晚辈看待长辈的视角。就比如年轻人之所以亲切称呼费翔为“费翔daddy”，不仅仅在于他在《封神第一部》中饰演的就是一个父亲，也在于他是很多年轻人心中理想的父亲形象、理想的长辈形象。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;现实生活中，很多长辈往往热衷于以长辈的身份对年轻人说教，对年轻人的生活方式指手画脚。而从费翔的一系列访谈中，我们可以看出他对每个人生活方式的尊重，他对于婚姻、爱情以及其他关键的人生议题都有深刻的洞察。他不干涉，不说教，睿智又优雅。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;也有一些长辈，热衷于以长辈的身份倚老卖老，什么都是我老我说了算，年轻人就得听我的，年轻人就得尊重我、得捧我……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在《披荆斩棘3》中，很多年轻人才第一次看到一个那么真实、那么私人的蔡国庆：他一点架子没有，很放得开，完全能够跟年轻人打成一片，别人提的建议他都愿意“听劝”，也随和亲切得不得了……这样的“长辈”谁不爱处？年轻人不会有下位者的压力、尴尬与煎熬，他们内心中依然对长辈有敬重，他们也依然能够自由轻松地做自己。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;总之，年轻人追捧“妈妈严选”的背后，是年轻人对于时下内娱生态的不满，是年轻人苦一些长辈的压力久矣却无力挣脱或敢怒不敢言的无奈。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在寄望于这样的“妈妈严选”能够多一些的同时，年轻人倒也不妨以“妈妈严选”为榜样，成长为一个更好的人，最后也能成为更好的长辈。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从张亮和杨国福说起：特色县的产业聚集为何常常以乡情亲缘为纽带？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258299]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;网上曾传言两大麻辣烫巨头张亮和杨国福是亲戚：张亮本来在舅舅杨国福的店里打工，后来出去单干，创立了张亮麻辣烫。后来，张亮对此：“没有血缘关系，是亲属关系。”杨国福也作出了和张亮一致的表述。所以，有一点多半是肯定的，那就是张亮的确受到了杨国福的启发。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张亮和杨国福也启发了当地人，两人的老家哈尔滨宾县，发展成了麻辣烫行业的集聚地，除了张亮和杨国福之外，还有许多其他品牌，堪称“麻辣烫之都”。用杨国福公司生产负责人的话就是：“一个村子干，大家都跟着干，这个行业就起来了。”不难想见，无数个宾县有野心的年轻人，正是顺着他们的足迹，进入麻辣烫行业创业，从而改变自己的命运。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，这并非特例。很多人会记得，上高中的时候，学校周围的打印店是湖南人开的；几千里之外的大学，学校里与周边的复印店还是湖南人开的；读研究生，换一个地方，打印店仍然是湖南人开的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些湖南人都来自娄底市新化县，著名的复印之乡。新化县位于湖南省中部，境内山脉纵横，环境恶劣，人均耕地不到0.15亩。恶劣的自然环境，逼迫新化人走出去，早在改革开放之前的1960年，新化人易代兴、易代育兄弟在四川涪陵偶然学会了机械打字机维修技术，就此成为新化人复印机产业的发端。新化人把日本和美国的二手复印设备通过国际贸易扩散到国内，提供维修、耗材的支撑，通过专业市场销售到复印店，形成了一条“国际贸易+专业市场+专业店”的完整产业链。凭着这条产业链，凡是有了新化人的地方，复印价格飞速降低，把其他地域的人赶出市场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的现象还很多，桐庐快递、成都小吃、沙县小吃、福建莆田医疗、曹县汉服、灌云内衣等等。某种程度上，这是产业聚集与中国式人际关系嫁接所形成的一个独特现象：产业的亲缘、地域聚集。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些产业聚集的形成路径都差不多，最初，是某个当地人在某个行业获得成功，事业扩大，拉更多的亲戚朋友加入；在产业链上也顺着熟人人脉寻找供应商或经销商。再后来，亲戚朋友很可能自立门户，或者其他人看到了也模仿，更多的人加入。最后形成了产业集群。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;形成这个现象的原因是多方面的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;社会学有一个六度分隔理论，即世界上任何两个人，通过六个相互认识的人就能连接起来。简单地说，你通过六个人就能认识美国总统。这看起来不可能，其实说穿了不难，比如其中一条路径：任何人都可以轻易地认识一个大学生，通过大学生的老师，就能连接到校长。大学校长已经是非常高层的关系，再通过两三个人就能上到更高层面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在六度分隔的基础上，有学者提出了三度分隔理论，就是说，相距三度之内是强连接，强连接可以引发人的行为。相距超过三度是弱连接，而弱连接只能传递信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;强连接能引发行动并不难理解。强连接首先开阔了人的视野，提供了选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;B站有一个叫“非洲飞哥”的up主，拍非洲风土人情的视频，赶上了短视频的风口。他文化程度并不高，但因为他有一个在非洲务工超过十年的父亲，所以，他去非洲打工。他人聪明又勤奋，先是打工，后来做生意，再后来发现短视频。显然，没有他父亲，他的人生基本上不可能接触到“去非洲”这个选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;强连接还能刺激“自己身边的人”去追求成功，哪怕你只是发了一个小财，你周边的人也非常敏感，产生出羡慕之情。另一方面，身边的人，可能是自己的发小、同学、亲戚，或者朋友的朋友，比较了解，不会神化，会让人觉得是一种可以模仿的对象、可以企及的成功，进而刺激自己也去追求这种成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种强连接是传递资源的。有一次，去南通参加一个活动，走访家纺城。遇到一位1997年出生的年轻老板，当时24岁，开一辆宝马五系，经营的家纺店做得很大。活动完了，大家一起吃饭，老板说自己16岁就出来做事了。我问他是什么时候从打工转变为自立门户做生意的。之所以这么问，我的想法是：16岁就出来闯荡，学历不高，肯定是家里经济条件不好，所以才早早出来打工，积累了第一桶金，有了行业经验，然后自己创业，获得成功。但他说：我从来没有打过工，一出来就独立做生意了，我爸妈、我哥哥、姐姐都是做这个的，他们带着我，就自己开店了。这就是强连接提供选择、提供资源的典型例子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商业本身，也追求这种强连接。经济学中的产业聚集，指在一个适当大的区域范围内，生产某种产品的若干个不同类企业，以及为这些企业配套的上下游企业、相关服务业，高度密集地聚集在一起。相同行业的企业聚集在一起，搜索原料产品的成本，获得配套的产品和服务的成本，交通、沟通的成本，都因地理距离变近而变小，带来更大的竞争力，由此导致了产业聚集。本质上，降低成本是推动产业聚集的最基础动力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陌生人之间要建立信任是很难的，企业在经营过程中很大的成本就是沟通成本、信任成本。那么，同样的，从降低成本的角度出发，产业链上的企业就会沿着人际关系聚集。这也是家族企业在各国久盛不衰的原因所在。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，换个角度，这就是人们所说的圈子。当然，人从圈子获益也取决于自己，有些人要爹妈送到手上都干不好，有些人只是听说了，就立马行动起来，跟随、学习、模仿，最后获得成功。所以，说到底，最大的因素还是人本身。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Still from the movie &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the winter three years ago, I went to Joshua Tree National Park for stargazing with my boyfriend at the time. Neither of us knew when we went there that Joshua Tree’s reputation came from a hallucination caused by an overdose of marijuana. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Joshua Tree is located deep in the desert in the outer suburbs of Los Angeles, so it can be said that this illusion is a type of mirage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My ex-boyfriend is from South Korea, a devout Christian, and a scientist by profession. His favorite movie is Nolan&#39;s &quot;Interstellar&quot;, and his fascination with the stars can be said to be a combination of science and faith. On the one hand, he has an endless thirst for knowledge about space and areas unknown to mankind. On the other hand, if we borrow Mr. Qian Mu’s metaphor and regard the known human beings as these little bits of starlight, and the vast and endless darkness as the unknown realm, then the ex-boyfriend’s response to this is: There must be a creator who created All of this, and we humans must spend our entire lives searching for the goodness of everything He created. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I love reading theology books, I do not believe in any religion. At that time, the starry sky was more of a natural wonder to me. It&#39;s a pity that the two of us put on down jackets and raised our heads like nestlings begging for food in the cold desert night. The starry sky that caught our eyes was not as charming as the one I had seen on the Iowa farm. Sitting on the tractor in the Iowa farm, I was really shocked by the Milky Way above my head: the stars were like the stone bridges on the streams in the Yunnan-Guizhou region, intermittently extending from one bank of the river to the other bank. I tried to Trace each star point with your eyes, imagining that the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl are like this, carefully stepping on the stars to meet in the middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My ex-boyfriend went stargazing for the first time, and the blurry starry sky over Joshua Tree captured his heart. He also became more convinced that it was the hand of God that created all of this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;——Perhaps, the different attitudes towards Xingguang have already hinted that this relationship is destined to end in vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that I think of this past incident, it may be because I have been wandering around for these years. Some time ago, a teacher at Washington University in St. Louis asked me to write a letter of recommendation for her. Her resume was full of ups and downs in her academic career. She had held teaching positions in New York State, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Missouri. Now, After ten years of teaching in St. Louis, she finally had a chance to settle down. As a doctoral candidate, I also know that if I am looking for a teaching position, I am destined to face this kind of great migration experience every few years. To be honest, I&#39;m tired of this. The biggest difficulty with living a nomadic life is this: you never make lasting connections. It&#39;s not easy to make one or two close friends, or a lover who you thought would be a lifelong companion, but because of your own or the other person&#39;s migration, the relationship broke up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Separation, to me, is like letting go of two people and falling into the vast abyss of the universe at the same time without a trace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is no accident that many poems at home and abroad use starlight to compare separation. I have reached the age where my eyes well up with tears when I read Du Fu&#39;s &quot;If we don&#39;t meet each other in life, we will move like participating in business&quot;. When I was in middle school, the first time I read Xu Zhimo&#39;s &quot;Accidental&quot; I just thought it was romantic. I even thought it was a high-sounding excuse for a playboy because of various ancient moral prejudices. However, now, once again imagining &quot;you and me&quot; who &quot;disappeared in an instant&quot;, all we can remember in the end is &quot;the light that shined on each other when we met&quot;, and I feel more helpless. Because the lost relationship and friendship can no longer be traced in the dark night, the only thing that can be remembered is the memory as bright as the starlight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern psychology classifies &quot;death of relatives and friends&quot;, &quot;broken love&quot;, &quot;unemployment&quot; and &quot;loss of money&quot; as &quot;loss&quot;. Loss is difficult to digest, because no matter how much we mourn, how much we regret, how much we grieve, we cannot get rid of the reality that it is hard to recover. I have not been close to people since I was a child, so once I lose someone close to me, it is difficult to recover. Even today, seventeen years after my grandfather passed away, I still miss him and walk with him on familiar streets in my dreams. Even though I am clearly aware that I am in a dream, I still hope that this dream can last longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with losses, many people will eventually fall into the mentality of gamblers, constantly increasing their bets in order to win back everything they have lost before, so that they fall deeper and deeper into the trap. I have met friends who have always been in good schools. Because of a failure in an exam or failure in applying to a prestigious school, they kept applying year after year, so that all the meaning of life lies in whether they can get back this one. After falling out of love, many people will rush into the next relationship, eager to turn the previous failure experience into the next success. Unfortunately, this kind of eagerness for success will probably only suffer greater trauma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year, I also sat alone in the mire-like darkness, and almost fell into the never-ending gambler&#39;s mentality. Finally, it was the famous words of the ancient Roman Neo-Stoic philosopher Epictetus that woke me up: &quot;Don&#39;t think of loss as loss, think of it as return.&quot; In other words, those dazzling moments when the stars meet are never It does not belong to me, but it is temporarily loaned to me by the universe. One day, I must return this gift. All I can do is try to cherish it while borrowing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is opening this generous &quot;library&quot; behind the world? I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t have the answer. All I know is that those who believe in gods are blessed, and they can draw more strength from their faith to survive the dark night. Let&#39;s take the loss as an example. A devout believer will shed his attachment to himself. Without attachment, there is no need to go bankrupt just to save face. Without attachment, he will feel that when he walks in the world, all encounters and companionship are worthy of gratitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the British poet WH Auden&#39;s famous work &quot;More Love&quot; (translated by Huang Canran), Auden regards the burning of stars as &quot;the unrequited passion of mankind&quot;, because of this love Only with the admiration and gratitude of the stars can he say: &quot;If all the stars fall or disappear, / I will learn to look at an empty sky / and feel the solemnity of its complete darkness, / although it may take me a while .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[浙江国祥 IPO申购前夕暂停，谁欲分享资本盛宴？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258403]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/EzqH3Y4F6QmiFFWlwVxyIw3QnpuhD4Fv75Ob7Szf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;845&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/EzqH3Y4F6QmiFFWlwVxyIw3Q npuhD4Fv75Ob7Szf. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253745&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Retailers play cards on the exchange. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang, which plans to start subscribing in the secondary market on October 9, 2023, due to Public opinion surged, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange actually stopped the IPO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 7, the first day of resumption of work after the holiday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange issued a response to reporters&#39; questions, saying that in the spirit of being responsible for the market and investors, it would respond to the situation reported by the self-media and treat Zhejiang Guoxiang Conduct a special inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the prospectus, Zhejiang Guoxiang was established in 2009 and is headquartered in Shaoxing City.

It has served Luxshare Precision, BYD, and Ningde Well-known customers and projects in various industries such as Times, Hangzhou Metro Group, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, and Beijing Winter Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2015, Zhejiang Guoxiang was listed on the New Third Board, and submitted prospectus materials to the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Science and Technology Innovation Board twice at the end of 2016 and in 2020, but the IPO failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, Zhejiang Guoxiang once again impacted the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It took 159 days to obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for its IPO registration, which was just one step away from success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, Zhejiang Guoxiang announced an issue price of 68.07 yuan per share, with an issue price-to-earnings ratio of 51.29 times. The plan was to open subscriptions on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, after a short holiday, the clamor that its issue price was too high has become louder and louder. In addition, there have been doubts about Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s secondary listing of the same asset in the past, and the controversy has intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, the Shanghai Stock Exchange once again issued a response to Zhejiang Guoxiang’s suspension of IPO issuance, introduced the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s preliminary review and supervision of the company, and stated that in response to the market and the majority of investors, Concerned, the Shanghai Stock Exchange will seriously organize a special inspection of Zhejiang Guoxiang and will decide on follow-up work based on the results of the special inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did Zhejiang Guoxiang cause public outrage? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Second listing of the same asset? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the prospectus, Zhejiang Guoxiang’s assets come indirectly from Zhejiang Guoxiang Refrigeration Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guoxiang Refrigeration), which is the first Taiwan-funded enterprise listed on the A-share market. , which is quite symbolic in the mainland capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taihai.com reported in 2008 that the parent company of Guoxiang Refrigeration was Guoxiang Refrigeration Machinery Company, which was established in Taoyuan, Taiwan in 1966. It was the largest manufacturer of industrial refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment in Taiwan at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above report stated that in 1995, Chen Hegui, chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration Machinery Company, went to Zhejiang to invest and established Guoxiang Refrigeration as a joint venture with Zhejiang Shaoxing Refrigeration Equipment Factory. After that, Chen Tianlin succeeded his father Chen Hegui and became the chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration. Guoxiang Refrigeration was listed on the A-share market in 2003 with the stock code 600340. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to subjective and objective factors such as poor operating conditions, Guoxiang Refrigeration suffered continuous losses in 2007 and 2008. In May 2009, it was issued a delisting risk warning and became *ST Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2009, Guoxiang Refrigeration announced that it planned to sell out all its existing assets and liabilities through major asset swaps and the issuance of shares to Xingfu Foundation, and at the same time inject the shares held by Xingfu Foundation into Real estate development and regional development business assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One month ago, Chen Tianlin resigned as chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration, and Chen Genwei served as chairman and general manager of Guoxiang Refrigeration.

(hereinafter referred to as Guoxiang Holdings) controlled by Chen Genwei and his wife used 80 million to acquire the transfer Zhejiang Guoxiang has 100% equity, and Chen Genwei has also been promoted to chairman of Zhejiang Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retailers therefore questioned Zhejiang Guoxiang’s IPO, which was considered a secondary listing of the same asset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, during the IPO application process of Zhejiang Guoxiang in 2020 and this time, the Shanghai Stock Exchange made inquiries about the source of Zhejiang Guoxiang’s assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, the Shanghai Stock Exchange asked Zhejiang Guoxiang to explain the proportion of its assets from the original listed company in its current assets and the role of its production and operations in its inquiry. It also asked the company to combine Past cases in the capital market indicate whether there are similar precedents in which the assets of a listed company were reorganized and then relisted with the same assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang listed a number of similar cases in its reply, such as Sichuan Instruments (603100.SH), Leon Micro (605358.SH), etc., saying that their main assets came from listed companies’ acquisitions. out assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the secondary listing, the Shanghai Stock Exchange stated in its response to reporters on October 9 that after review, the transactions of this part of the assets occurred in 2011 and 2012, and the total book assets related to the acquisition at the end of 2022 The relevant net fixed assets accounted for 15% and 0.06% of Zhejiang Guoxiang’s total existing assets respectively. Zhejiang Guoxiang has shifted from focusing on commercial central air conditioners to mainly industrial central air conditioners. Its business, products, and technology Substantial changes have taken place in research and development, personnel and sales models, actual controllers and management. At the same time, there is basically no overlap between Zhejiang Guoxiang’s sales customers and suppliers and *ST Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding listing standards, the Shanghai Stock Exchange quoted Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus, saying that its cumulative net profit in the past three years was 387 million yuan, its net profit in the most recent year was 186 million yuan, and its cash generated from operating activities in the past three years The cumulative net flow was 600 million yuan, and the cumulative operating income was 4.226 billion yuan. &quot;Zhejiang Guoxiang complies with the first set of motherboard listing standards.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/IMsplTUYVODSvJG1Hixdfl4GpDumv6wy93BY5qAF.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/IMsplTUYVODSvJG1Hixdfl4GpDumv6wy93BY5qAF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 253746&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The closing stock index of the day is displayed on an LED screen outside a building in Lujiazui, Shanghai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Super Raising&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;1.4&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Billion Yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to the secondary listing, the trigger for IPO controversy is also the excessive issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s issue price is 68.07 yuan per share, and the issue price-to-earnings ratio is 51.29 times. Such a high issue price was also beyond Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that the company is expected to use 737 million yuan in raised funds for this fundraising project. Based on the issue price of 68.07 yuan per share and the number of new shares issued of 35.0234 million shares, if this issuance is successful, Zhejiang Guoxiang is expected to raise a total of 2.384 billion yuan, after deducting the issuance expenses (excluding value-added tax) of 227.8 million yuan, The net amount of funds raised is expected to be 2.156 billion yuan, with an excess of 1.419 billion yuan raised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s issue price-to-earnings ratio of 51.29 times is not only higher than the industry average, but also higher than the comparable companies in the industry it lists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;special equipment manufacturing industry (C35)&quot; in which it is located, as of September 26, 2023, the static average price-to-earnings ratio of C35 in the CSI Index industry in the past month was 27.81 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang disclosed five comparable companies in the same industry. After excluding the extreme value Jialitu (180.3 times) and the loss-making Yimikang, the average price-to-earnings ratio of the remaining three companies in 2022 is 45.82 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market criticized Zhejiang Guoxiang’s operating performance as being unable to match the issue price. Within the industry, Zhejiang Guoxiang has not yet occupied a dominant position, and its sustained profitability has been repeatedly questioned by the Shanghai Stock Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang stated in the prospectus that since its establishment, it has been focusing on the research and development, production and sales of industrial and commercial central air-conditioning. After years of efforts, it has grown into a relatively large player in the industrial and commercial central air-conditioning industry. An enterprise with high brand competitiveness. However, the company&#39;s market shares in 2020, 2021 and 2022 are only 1.20%, 1.28% and 1.77% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that Zhejiang Guoxiang’s revenue increased from 470 million yuan to 834 million yuan from 2015 to 2019. However, its net profit fluctuated greatly, which were 53.3466 million yuan, 47.1391 million yuan, and 28.3440 yuan respectively. Ten thousand yuan, 43.937 million yuan, 67.3813 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three years of the epidemic from 2020 to 2022, Zhejiang Guoxiang not only increased its revenue steadily, but its net profit also increased significantly, reaching 99.7907 million yuan, 101.3427 million yuan and 185.9114 million yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this IPO issuance process, the first question in the implementation letter of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Review Center required Zhejiang Guoxiang to disclose the matching of its net profit growth in 2022 with the company&#39;s revenue growth, and analyze the rapid revenue growth in 2022 The main logic of growth and the sustainability of future growth, and reveal the risks of unsustainable rapid growth and provide reminders of major matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the Shanghai Stock Exchange Listing Committee meeting held on June 19, the Shanghai Stock Exchange once again required Zhejiang Guoxiang to explain whether its ability to continue operating has been significantly improved and improved based on the fact that its assets came from the original listed company *ST Guoxiang. , whether the relevant risk disclosure is sufficient. At the same time, the sponsor representative is requested to express clear opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The motivation for institutions to create new products at high prices&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The high issuance price is reported by institutional investors during the inquiry period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that a total of 8,732 placement targets managed by 800 offline investors participated in Zhejiang Guoxiang’s preliminary inquiry. The quotation range is 7.80 yuan/share-103.50 yuan/share, corresponding to the total number of proposed subscriptions. The total number of shares sold was 51.074 billion, and the overall offline subscription multiple was 2,700 times the initial offline issuance scale before the callback. Quotation subscriptions were relatively active. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After excluding invalid quotes and the highest quotes, there are still 733 investors, corresponding to 8,547 allotment objects. The highest excluded quotes refer to allotment objects whose subscription price is higher than 81.49 yuan/share, and allotment objects whose subscription price is 81.49 yuan/share and whose planned subscription quantity is less than 3.8 million shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lower of the average and the median quotes from offline investors is 73.6 yuan/share. Among them, the median quotations from public funds, fund management companies, insurance companies, securities companies, futures companies, trust companies and private equity funds are all around 74 yuan, which is higher than the final issuance price of 69.07 yuan per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among public funds, this is especially true for those who quote high prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seventeen products of Golden Eagle Fund quoted a high price of 92.52 yuan per share, a 33.9% premium to the issue price, and were all eliminated. 29 products under Harvest Fund quoted 81.94 yuan per share. They were eliminated because the number of planned subscriptions was less than 3.8 million shares. Another 122 products with the same quotation met the subscription quantity requirements and were shortlisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the valid quotes, Wells Fargo Fund (quoted at 80.75 yuan/share), Chuangjin Hexin (quoted at 80 yuan/share), Shenwan Lingxin Fund (quoted at 79 yuan/share), ICBC Credit Suisse Fund and CCB Credit Fund (quoted at 79 yuan/share) The quotations of public funds such as 78 yuan/share) far exceeded the issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is a company whose performance is really not impressive so sought after by institutions? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private equity fund person explained to Southern Weekend reporters that the issue price pricing rules are relatively complex, involving the average and median of institutional quotations, and the average and median of quotations from social security funds, pension insurance, etc. Compare. The inquiry for new stocks only eliminates 1% of the high prices. As long as the quotation is slightly higher than the average price, institutions can be shortlisted and finally get the new stocks at the issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If new stocks in the market have a good profit-making effect recently, or the subject of new stocks is popular, institutions will increase their quotations to ensure shortlisting. The person said frankly, &quot;Regardless of the finalists, we all point to other institutions to look at the fundamentals. In fact, no one looks at it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main board’s new stock inquiry and pricing mechanism originally had an invisible ceiling of 23 times the price-earnings ratio. After the comprehensive registration system reform was launched, the company&#39;s issuance price was liberalized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, market voices generally believed that companies to be listed with good development prospects would obtain higher valuation levels in the issuance of new shares, and companies with relatively limited development space would see their valuations return quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Former senior sponsor Wang Jiyue told Southern Weekend reporters that after the new IPO policy, the supply of new shares was low and the risk of new shares was expected to be low, so prices went up. Not only the institutional quotations of Zhejiang Guoxiang are high, but the overall quotations of new shares are also high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are some irresponsible quotations.” Wang Jiyue analyzed that the reason why institutions quoted high prices was because they expected that the stock price would not break within a few days after listing. Loss is a small probability event and does not affect the interests of fund managers. , the quotation is not binding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Institutional quotations have become based on transaction expectations, rather than based on the company’s true value.” In his view, the meaning of the existence of institutional investors is to guide correct quotations. &quot;The power to set the issue price is in the hands of institutions, and there are not many practical constraints on institutional quotations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Institutional investors who participated in the inquiry also attributed the motivation for high-priced new products to &quot;making money from new products in the near future.&quot; Private equity fund Shiva Mavericks has 6 products quoted at 73.65 yuan, which were shortlisted for Zhejiang Guoxiang’s effective quotes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Hong, the manager of Shiva Mavericks Fund who is known as the &quot;Ten Billion Private Equity Boss&quot;, responded to the quotation in Xueqiu and said, &quot;Monguli will have an obvious effect of making new money in the future, and it will sell on the first day of trading.&quot; The average profit is 80%, so the main purpose is to seek finalists for quotations, and don’t care about the price. If you lose money after a few losses, then you have to be selective and quote a lower price.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Liang Hong’s view, the problem lies in the high-priced IPOs, rather than in recruiting new ones. &quot;Some people say that this or that company is not worth the money, so why should they pay a high price? I want to know even more, why do they take over the market at a high price after there is so much money after listing? If not, why should I call you?&quot; At present, Liang Hong is Messages have been deleted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after the new shares are listed, who will take over? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xueqiu user &quot;Xiaye Guapeng&quot; cleverly discovered that for stocks listed at the end of each quarter, through the top ten circulating shareholders disclosed by them, we can know what the new shares will be after 5 trading days. Which funds are taking over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no limit on the price of new shares in the first five trading days, and they are subject to special regulatory attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on this logic, he analyzed 9 stocks that were listed at the end of each quarter in 2022 and 2023, and found that securities companies, which are strongly related to the issuance of new shares, will use their own funds to make large-scale purchases a few days after listing. Buy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Zhiou Technology (301376.SZ) and Guoke Military Industry (688543.SH), which were listed on June 21, 2023, the ten largest circulating shareholders disclosed in the interim report include the securities firm CICC , CITIC Securities, Huatai Securities, Guotai Junan Securities and China Merchants Securities, and they are all new shareholders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Jiyue’s view, high-priced innovation by institutions is not a single issue. &quot;New stock pricing rules, new stock supply and demand, stock circulation ratio, and behavioral finance under the tradition of new stock speculation all need to be taken into consideration.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Hundreds of millions of underwriting fees are suspended&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Stock investors also have doubts about Orient Securities (600958.SH), the sponsor of Zhejiang Guoxiang, and believe that Orient Securities has not been diligent and responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Orient Securities’ sponsorship fee for undertaking Zhejiang Guoxiang’s IPO this time is 2 million yuan. In addition, Orient Securities is also the underwriter, and underwriting fees are charged based on a certain proportion of the total funds raised. This is the more important income of Orient Securities in this IPO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus shows that the underwriting fees charged by Orient Securities vary according to the total amount of funds raised, and the rate ratio fluctuates in three levels: 7.50%, 7.70%, and 8.70%, and different fixed fees are also attached. cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on Zhejiang Guoxiang’s total fund-raising of 2.384 billion yuan, Orient Securities can receive over 184 million yuan in underwriting fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2023, the total revenue of Orient Securities’ investment banking business was 741.5 million yuan. Zhejiang Guoxiang’s underwriting fee of nearly 200 million yuan is of great significance to its performance in the second half of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 10, Orient Securities issued an announcement on the investment banking project, stating that the underwriting rate for the Zhejiang Guoxiang issuance was 7.74% as determined through negotiation between the sponsor and the issuer. However, the specific calculation method was not disclosed. Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s issuance has been suspended, and Orient Securities has not yet collected underwriting fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus, the company also has indirect equity relationships with Orient Securities and its affiliates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Orient Securities Hande holds 2.74% of the total pre-issuance share capital of Zhejiang Guoxiang, while Shanghai Orient Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orient Securities, invested 11.11% in Orient Securities Hande. In other words, Orient Securities indirectly holds 0.03% of the shares of Zhejiang Guoxiang before its listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s controlling shareholder Guoxiang Holdings holds 16.34%, 14.71%, 4.44% and 12.51% of the capital contributions of Orient Securities Zhoude, Orient Securities Tangde, Orient Securities Xia De, and Orient Securities Hechuang respectively. share. Shanghai Orient Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orient Securities, holds 15.03%, 19.12%, 18.89% and 19.99% of the investment shares of these four companies respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned five companies named &quot;Orient Securities&quot; are all investment institutions mainly funded by Shanghai Oriental Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd. and serving as executive partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oriental Securities has been investigated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 15, 2016, two penalty decisions issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission disclosed the entire process of creating the &quot;demon stock&quot; of Anshuo Information (300380.SZ), which Oriental Securities was mainly involved in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 30, 2014, a then computer industry researcher from Orient Securities sent an email to the chairman and general manager of Anshuo Information, saying that the stock price of Anshuo Information had fallen to near the issue price and that the value was absolutely underestimated. , expressed the hope to communicate with the company and then recommend it to the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From June 22, 2014 to April 30, 2015, the then chief analyst of the computer industry at Orient Securities and the above-mentioned researcher used &quot;extremely business scalable, strongly optimistic, and the best quality banking IT&quot; We wrote emails with inductive and exaggerated words such as &quot;Target, Unparalleled, Absolutely Leading&quot;, and sent a total of more than 11,000 emails to 1,279 people in 128 funds, securities firms, private equity and other institutions, disseminating iShares information to carry out Internet financial services and the Internet. financial business situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some fund management companies bought a large amount of iShares Information from November 1, 2014 to May 27, 2015.

Anshuo Information&#39;s stock price rose from 28.30 yuan/share on April 30, 2014 to 450 yuan/share on May 13, 2015, an increase of 15.9 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the China Securities Regulatory Commission opened the case for investigation, the above two Orient Securities employees were ordered to make corrections and were given administrative penalties of 200,000 yuan and 150,000 yuan respectively, and a warning was given to Anshuo Information and the company’s chairman and secretary. , and were fined 600,000 yuan, 300,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
