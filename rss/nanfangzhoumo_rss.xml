(Photo provided by People’s Vision)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 18, 1968, China’s northernmost black land entered the best season of the year. A unit with the main task of “reclamation and border defense”-Heilongjiang Production Construction Corps - established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In pursuit of the goal of &quot;reclaiming the Great Northern Wilderness&quot;, millions of urban educated youths rushed to a foreign land that was covered in frost all year round. In the vigorous tide of the times, young Fan Gang is no exception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Fan Gang was born in 1953 in an intellectual family. His parents left Shanghai after graduating from church school and went to work in Beijing. There, after Fan Gang finished primary school, the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; began and he was assigned to attend a nearby middle school. But in just the past year and a half, the general environment has changed. In 1969, Fan Gang, who had just learned a few English letters, was assigned to work in the Heilongjiang Corps as an educated youth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Logging, clearing up wasteland, and farming, it took six years in a flash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Despite being separated from the school environment, Fan Gang is still learning and thinking. Around 1974, the Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps discussed trialling the work point system and reforming the original fixed wage system, and Fan Gang&#39;s company was selected as one of the pilots. Relying on the &quot;Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism&quot; and &quot;Political Economics Textbooks&quot; he had read, Fan Gang put forward his own opinions on the pilot plan and was invited to attend a meeting at the Corps headquarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In 1975, Fan Gang was transferred to the countryside of Weichang County, Hebei Province, where his cousin lived, because he was visiting relatives and friends. There, there are only two meals a day in winter. After finishing millet porridge at 5 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, people are starving by seven or eight o&#39;clock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;But soon, a turning point came. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Less than a year after leaving the village, Fan Gang was seconded to the county cultural center to engage in mass literary and artistic creation. In 1977, Fan Gang was experiencing life in the commune iron foundry when he heard the news on the radio about the resumption of the college entrance examination. Relying on the knowledge accumulated through years of reading miscellaneous books, he stood out from more than 5.7 million candidates across the country and was admitted to the Department of Economics of Hebei University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Four years later, Fan Gang was admitted to the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, which had absolute authority in the field of economics at the time, and studied under Professor Zhu Shaowen, continuing to study his favorite field. Western Economics. There, Fan Gang&#39;s talent in economics was recognized again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In 1985, upon the recommendation of Dong Fucheng, then director of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Fan Gang was given the opportunity to study abroad, studying at the National Bureau of Economic Research and Harvard University in the United States. economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;As important as talent is Fan Gang&#39;s diligence. Mentor Zhu Shaowen once mentioned that Fan Gang worked very hard when he was studying in the United States. He often couldn&#39;t get home because he left too late, so he slept under the table in the research bureau. In 1988, Fan Gang, who returned to China after completing his studies, successfully completed his doctoral thesis, and together with his fellow student Zuo Dapei, became the first two Western economics Ph.D.s independently trained in China after the reform and opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After receiving his degree, Fan Gang continued to stay at the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;His academic achievements and social influence extend far beyond the ivory tower. In the 1990s and early 21st century when China&#39;s reform and opening up set off huge waves, Fan Gang was a representative of young scholars in the economics community. At the age of 38, he won the Sun Yefang Economic Science Award, the highest award in domestic economics research; at the age of 39, he was promoted to the Academy of Social Sciences. Researcher; at the age of 40, he became one of the youngest doctoral supervisors in the Chinese social science community; in addition to academic work, he was twice appointed by the State Council as a member of the Central Bank&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;For his contributions and achievements in the field of transition economics, Fan Gang won the highest award in the domestic economic theory circle, the &quot;China Economic Theory Innovation Award.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, along with the honor and cheers, there are also doubts from the outside world. In 2018, during an interview with the media, Fan Gang was pushed into the limelight because of his view of &quot;emptying 6 wallets to buy a house.&quot; When asked about this view again two years later, Fan Gang responded that it was intended to express that houses were too expensive for young people to afford, rather than to encourage young people to &quot;gnaw at their old age.&quot; However, if he hadn&#39;t been asked again, he &quot;couldn&#39;t remember it&quot; himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;On November 2, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters met this 70-year-old scholar who is still energetic. Perhaps as a result of studying economics for many years, Fan Gang has a consistent determination, as if all the great changes of the times are just pebbles thrown into the lake to him, and all he wants is to &quot;hope that China will do well.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Only debate is exciting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, you were admitted to the Department of Economics of Hebei University. Why did you choose this major? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I went to the countryside in Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps in 1969. The books I read at that time were all related to Marxism-Leninism, philosophy, political economics, and scientific socialism. After a lot of study, I found that I was more interested in political economics. &lt;br>;At that time, we also faced practical problems, which made people think. At that time, a company of the Construction Corps could still make a profit by farming with just 20 people. However, when more than 100 of us educated youths left, the cost increased and we actually lost money. It is said that labor creates value, how should we understand it now? At the same time, everyone is trying to change the status quo, which makes me more interested in economic issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In addition to reading theoretical books, I was also interested in literature. At that time, everyone wanted to be a literary and artistic young man, so I also worked hard on writing. Later, I also engaged in creation at the county cultural center and wrote some folk art programs. But literary creation relies on perceptual thinking. At that time, I thought that this aspect was not my real interest, because I was not good at telling stories and I was not motivated to tell them. What&#39;s the excitement, the theoretical debate, I get excited as soon as the debate starts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, and everyone could apply for three choices. I applied for economics in all of them, but not literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;You once mentioned that you are still When you went to the countryside in Heilongjiang, you once made suggestions for the reform of the work-point system, but they were not adopted. Did this experience dampen your enthusiasm for economics? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I don’t feel frustrated or unhappy. At that time, the Corps headquarters was discussing whether to change fixed wages to a work-point system, and our company was selected as the pilot. Because I had learned a little bit about political economics, I wrote a paper with my ideas, and the company instructor handed it to me. Later, the Corps invited the two of us to attend a seminar at the Corps headquarters in Jiamusi. It could be said to be my first seminar on economic issues. It was a pleasure for me to participate in the discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At that time, I was indeed very interested in theoretical research. Although I was not a professional and had no education, my interest was still very important. In the evening, everyone We all went to bed, and I was reading and writing alone under the oil lamp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, you Is the economics major you want to study highly competitive? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; At that time, there were very few subjects and very few enrollments. For the political economics major, Peking University has one enrollment quota in Hebei Province, Jilin University has only one in Hebei, and the others are Hebei University. &lt;br>;Before I went to the countryside, I was only a primary school graduate and never went to middle school. When I knew that I was going to take the college entrance examination, I only had a little over two months of review time left. Fortunately, I never stopped reading in those years, and I could find all the books I could find. I read them all, so I relied on the &quot;foundation&quot; of reading miscellaneous books in literature, history and philosophy at that time, and I learned mathematics in those two months. There were a total of 8 textbooks in middle school. I studied a little more than 7, and finally scored more than 60 points in the test. Attended Hebei University. Now that I think about it, the whole review process was not easy, and I grasped the last straw. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; You once mentioned that most of the university courses during your studies were classical economics. When did you first come into contact with modern economics? &lt;br>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I always say that we are a relatively lucky generation. When we first went to college in 1978, China’s economy was at its lowest point, with per capita income and economic growth rate very low. The Third Plenary Session of the First Central Committee was held, and the concept of reform gradually took shape. But in fact, what everyone was more familiar with at that time was the Soviet-style political economics. The modern economic theoretical system was not systematically taught in various universities. Only Professor Jiang Guangyuan, the department chair of Hebei University, did this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Professor Jiang graduated from Peking University with a master&#39;s degree in economics in the 1950s. He studied Western economics in his early years. During the ten years of turmoil, a group of them were decentralized and later transferred to support Hebei University. When I was a senior in college, when other schools were still teaching the &quot;school&quot; of Western economics, he gave us a textbook on the principles of modern economics in a systematic way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;It is also because this course allows us to master modern economics more systematically, so that we can realize that in those years when we were isolated from the world, modern economic theory It has become very complicated and needs to be remedied quickly. Only in this way can we talk to the world and know in which direction the theory should develop. So later I went to the Academy of Social Sciences for graduate school, and chose the history of Western economic thought as a major, and continued along this path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fan Gang&#39;s doctoral degree certificate.

What influence did he have on you when you were studying? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;Professor Zhu’s guidance mainly focused on learning and thinking methods. He emphasized the need to read the original works and lay down a solid foundation in basic theory. , forcing us to read many original English works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; What is your relationship with Professor Zhu over the years? Master and apprentice are like father and son. What kind of person do you think he is? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Professor Zhu is a very persistent person. In a certain sense, it can be said to be a bit stubborn, very persistent, Very stubborn. He sticks to his point of view, no matter what others say. After the reform and opening up, when everyone stopped talking about Marxist economic theory, Mr. Zhu still talked about it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Decades ago, he admired the views of List, the originator of German development economics. At that time, List believed that Germany was relatively backward and could not Economic measures adopted by developed countries must be adopted immediately, and there must be protection and certain government controls. Later, Japan learned from Germany, and Professor Zhu introduced these theories to China when he was studying at the University of Tokyo. But Professor Zhu&#39;s views were not recognized at that time, but now facts have proven that thanks to some unique industrial policies, our economy can develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Development economics advocated by Professor Zhu The point of view has also been inherited by you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; Some. To be honest, when the country was first opened, we paid more attention to the market economy itself. We were preoccupied with studying why other countries were so efficient and developed so advancedly, and we wanted to learn from Western systems to develop ourselves. At that time, before Western countries and we had reached the stage of competition, we were developing labor-intensive industries, and academic research was mainly concentrated in the field of institutional economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;It was not until the new century that we began to have some development competition with developed countries that we began to think more about development economics. After 2010, I started teaching development economics to graduate students at Peking University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Except for Professor Zhu, the past twenty During your years of study and research, are there any teachers whose teachings have had a greater impact on you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;This is a long story. One was Dong Fucheng, the then director of the institute. I once said in a commemorative article that I was able to study abroad because Director Dong gave me the only indicator. He felt that I had a foundation in foreign languages ​​​​and Western economics and could make good use of this opportunity, even though I was still young at the time. Not from the place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The second person who had a great influence on me was Liu Guoguang, the then vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He advocated reform. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, with his approval, we were able to set up a research group and write the book &quot;Outline of Macroeconomic Theory of Public Ownership&quot;. Although some of the views in this book were unclear at the time. Not entirely consistent with his views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;There is also Professor Zhang Shuguang, who is now 84 years old. He is both my collaborator and my predecessor. He was the deputy chief author of the &quot;Outline of Macroeconomic Theory of Public Ownership&quot;. Compared to me, the main writer, he has personally experienced the era of planned economy and many early research experiences, and is more familiar with the reality of China. When writing the book, I had many in-depth exchanges with him, and the theoretical system of the book was also constructed by us together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;There are also some old gentlemen who, although I have not had much contact with them, left a deep impression on me, such as Wu Baosan. He returned from studying economics at Harvard and advocated using more scientific methods to analyze China&#39;s economic history. When he studied history, he not only saw the historical facts, but also saw the economic logic within it. In order to do research, he spent a lot of effort. Even during the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, he still wrote a lot of things in his study, which was not easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;From today&#39;s perspective, they have been sitting on the bench for many years and have contributed to the basic project of Chinese economics. Don&#39;t forget them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Consensus is &quot;balance&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;During your PhD studies, you went to study in the United States and came up with the idea of ​​using modern economics theory to explain China’s problems. How could you come up with such an idea if you are not at the center of the reform trend? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;After all, I had been studying economics for nearly ten years before going abroad, and at the same time, I was studying China&#39;s economic issues. In addition, after graduating from elementary school, I first stayed in the Heilongjiang Corps for six years, and then stayed in rural Hebei for two years. I had a real sense of poverty in rural areas, and also a real sense of China&#39;s economic problems. I have personally seen people in a state where they don’t have enough to eat. I still remember one time when I went to a house in the village. A middle-aged man was lying on the kang. I asked him why he didn&#39;t go to work. He said that there was some food for my son to eat at noon. If he went to the fields, I couldn&#39;t go there. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After I went abroad and learned more things, I felt that I began to &quot;integrate&quot; theoretical and practical issues. The knowledge accumulated in the first 10 years of studying economics, Coupled with constant thinking about practical problems, I feel that I can better explain China&#39;s economic problems. I feel that I can do a lot of things, and these things are not what I can do abroad. I must do it with everyone at home. I did it, so I insisted on returning to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Regarding the Chinese economic theory at that time, Do you have any clear ideas or plans for renovation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; There is no systematic plan, I just feel that there is a need for systematic understanding and change. For example, at that time, there was an endless debate in China about which was the truth, Marxist political economics or modern economics. When I was writing my doctoral thesis, I gradually realized that any theory is a process of continuous innovation and synthesis. Different theories The theories will gradually integrate and learn from each other&#39;s strengths, so I wrote my doctoral thesis &quot;Comparison and Synthesis of the Three Major Modern Economic Theoretical Systems&quot;. The purpose at that time was that no matter what others said, I figured it out myself. From now on, if I encounter this kind of problem again, I won’t be entangled or come back to it again and again. My point of view is in this book. I don’t have to discuss it over and over again, so I can be free to study real economic issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;So in the first ten years after I came back, I wrote several big books with millions of words, as well as some papers and essays. After finishing them, I felt It&#39;s easier.

After passing the foreign language exam and publishing works on a certain scale, I was promoted to full professor under the exception, and all the professional title matters were completed around the age of 40. For me personally, I don’t want to be an official or do business. I really don’t have any specific goals. All I want to do is write something that can have an impact on others and contribute to the development of a discipline. However, I have also done some administrative work in recent years, including being responsible for two or three research institutions and fulfilling some social responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;In 2006, you became the central bank currency Member of the Policy Committee and served two terms thereafter.

You can observe closely how various ministries and commissions consider issues. From different angles, we can enhance our understanding of the so-called interest subjects. Different ministries and commissions are responsible for different things. They not only represent the overall interests of the country, but also represent different interest groups and have different perspectives. During the discussion, the people sitting in the room, that is, representatives of various ministries and commissions, will bring their own issues and perspectives to the decision-making circle. Everyone will speak out and explain these issues clearly. The consensus reached in this way will be To a certain extent, it is what is called &quot;equilibrium&quot; in economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;Goals should not be specific to things like position and money&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style= &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Judging from the papers you published, you have many academic opinions that directly point to institutional issues.

One reason is that after the reform and opening up, there was a better environment, everyone spoke more openly, and the problems we faced at that time were more realistic and acute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;But I don’t want to do anything to impress people. If I talk about a certain problem, the premise is that in my opinion, the problem really exists, and I I don’t want to turn a 3-point question into a 5-point or 10-point question. Although sometimes it may seem that what I say is harsh, the purpose is still to put forward some constructive ideas. The ultimate goal is to solve the problem. This is the bottom line that I have always adhered to. I hope China is good, and I hope China can continue to develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Analysis of China’s economy over the years Did you have any conflicts with others during the discussion? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;There are always some differences in opinions, and there are even some deeper differences, but in most cases over the years, I have I don’t argue with others. I always feel that I just need to explain my point of view well. Whether others accept it or not is their business. You don’t have to think about convincing anyone. This will consume a lot of energy and is meaningless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, in early February this year, I published an article in &quot;Management World&quot; in which I put forward my different opinions on the comparative advantage point of view emphasized by Professor Lin Yifu. view. The so-called comparative advantage generally means that a backward country should make good use of its advantage of lower costs of certain production factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;My basic point is that comparative advantage is only important in the early stages of our economic development, that is, before and after joining the WTO and before the wages of migrant workers skyrocketed. . When we enter the middle-income stage, comparative advantages gradually decline. What is really important at this time is the &quot;latecomer advantage&quot;, that is, through opening up to the outside world, learning, introduction, digestion, and absorption, and learning more as quickly as possible at a lower cost. Knowledge and technology allow this knowledge to play a role in our country and realize the spillover of knowledge elements. Our development has not only introduced advanced technology and equipment from the beginning, giving full play to our late-mover advantage. Our growth in the past two decades has mainly relied on various knowledge and technologies learned after the opening up, and we have gradually learned the ability to innovate. . Now the Americans are trying to curb our development. They use various means of containment, such as decoupling, cutting off supplies, stopping academic exchanges, restricting overseas students, etc., all of which are to prevent us from exerting our latecomer advantage. They don&#39;t care at all about your comparative advantage, because your comparative advantage is only the cost advantage of some &quot;primary factors&quot; and can only engage in some labor-intensive industries that they don&#39;t care about. What they are really afraid of is how we can quickly use our latecomer advantages to Increasing the &quot;high-quality elements&quot; of knowledge and technology has caused them to lose their comparative advantage in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;You mentioned in your autobiography, While visiting Harvard University, I was very impressed by their graduate training methods. After returning to China, I tried it in the graduate school. What adjustments did you make at that time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; Harvard graduate students have to take two years of classes and pass a qualifying exam before they can start writing a thesis. When graduate students take classes, they do not use textbooks, but directly teach papers. Even if they were just published yesterday, as long as everyone thinks they are valuable, the textbooks are only used for reference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;When I returned to China, I felt that China’s graduate education needed to be improved, so I applied for a grant and invited PhD students who had just returned to China or had obtained degrees abroad to For example, Hai Wen, Zhang Weiying and others gave lectures to graduate students in the Academy of Social Sciences, and I myself also gave lectures for two semesters to improve the knowledge level of the graduate school in the Department of Economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;For today’s young people, especially Do you have any life advice for college students and graduate students? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I have never allowed myself to be a &quot;youth mentor&quot;, so I don&#39;t have any life advice. My &quot;suggestion&quot; to myself is that the goal should not be specific to things like position and money, but should think more about how to make something decent and provide my own contribution in order to gain social recognition. From a life perspective, this is true satisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[官方回应“五月天被质疑假唱”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261781]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 20:09:02&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a blogger claimed that the two concerts of the well-known pop rock band &quot;Mayday&quot; in Shanghai and London were criticized.

Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wild boar was eventually trapped in a river that was more than 3 meters wide and about 200 meters long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on November 29, 2023, this wild boar appeared in Jianye District, Nanjing City from about 5 a.m., which had caused a lot of commotion, and was finally driven by the police to this small road called Nanhubei. In the ditch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the left bank there is a low lawn first, and then there is a palm bush about one meter above. The wild boar is hiding under the palm bush for a while. Dozens of special police officers and auxiliary police officers stood ready with shields and explosion-proof steel forks. Two staff members who came from the Hongshan Zoo Wildlife Conservation and Rescue Center were about 2 meters away from it and prepared anesthetic drugs urgently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the road on the right bank of the river, many residents have stood. In the video shot by netizens, a takeaway brother in the crowd rang the notice of assigning orders, and the voice was kicked off, and no one left; another uncle was carrying a bag of persimmons in his hand and standing onlookers; a lady walked the dog to walk the dog. After, I couldn&#39;t stop looking at the river and began to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We have never seen such new things, and we have never seen it.&quot; Wei Zhennan, deputy director of the Yiyuan Community Neighborhood Committee of Jianye District, Nanjing, told reporters from the Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Nanjing, the wild boar is the most frequent wildlife. The Nanjing Municipal Government has stated that it will formulate and improve the emergency plan for the disposal of wild boar police. Work. But for Wei Zhennan, such a big movement of hunting wild boars has never been seen before. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Water pigs &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Earlier media reports that the wild boar appeared on a campus in Jian&#39;ou District, Nanjing. After the security guard was found to be worried about the wild pig hurt, he called the police for help. After receiving the police, Nanjing Jianye went to the scene to search, and the wild boar began to rush out of the school and fled around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A staff member of the Beilei community in Nanhu Street told the southern weekend reporter that when the wild boar came to the community, it was six or seven in the morning. They had not yet went to work. . According to media reports, a security guard in the Beilei community was knocked down and bitten by a wild boar, and was sent to the hospital for six stitches. The above -mentioned staff said that they had to condolences to the injured security guards, but did not disclose the injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Yiyuan community, Wei Zhennan was already more than nine in the morning when he received a property phone call. The other party informed the residents to find that there was a wild boar activity in the jurisdiction. &quot;I thought it was a small wild boar at that time.&quot; Wei Zhennan also felt novel. After checking the monitoring with the community police, he found that at seven o&#39;clock in the morning, the wild boar had strolled in the community. In the monitoring, the wild boar was strong and there were more than two hundred pounds. &quot;So the police quickly requested support.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When Wei Zhennan rushed to the hiding place of the wild boar, the police of Jianye District had begun to take a warning and prepare to be arrested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Near 11 o&#39;clock, Li Feng (a pseudonym) of the Dynamic Institute of Wildlife Rescue Center of Hongshan Zoo received a call from the 110 Police Center and hurried to the scene. For Li Feng, this is part of his daily work. Every day he receives five or six wild animals for help, involving birds, snakes, wild boars and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is dangerous to shoot anesthesia for wild boars. Generally, Li Feng will work with colleagues to work with colleagues. The distance between blowing is 3-5 meters. Li Feng explained that it is far away. The injection cannot be pierced through the pig skin, and the anesthesia drugs are slow. If it is too close, the risk of the staff increases. The wild boar reaction was much faster than people. One time after the wild boar injected anesthesia, the staff chased for nearly two kilometers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This time on the banks of the South Hubei, Li Feng held anesthesia and blowing the pipe, squatted below the palm bush, and slowly poked his head to aim at the wild boar. The first anesthesia needle was shot to the head and neck of the wild boar, and the wild boar drilled out of the palm bush, bumped the police on the side, and soared along the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The crowds of the onlookers immediately surged. Police and community staff quickly increased their volume and evacuated the residents of the onlookers. It&#39;s okay. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the video shot by the media, after the wild boar ran hundreds of meters, it returned from the river. Li Feng took advantage of the wild boar to go ashore, and then shot three anesthesia. Li Feng estimated that the anesthesia was effective after about half an hour, and the wild boar was blocked under the bridge hole and took it ashore. However, because the wild boar anesthesia water, it was dying when she went ashore, and died on the way to Hongshan Zoo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the local media released a live video of catching wild boars, netizens suspected that it was the previous &quot;crossing Jiang Meng pig&quot; -the 12 minutes on November 27 crossed the Yangtze River and went to Nanjing. When crossing the river, Yao Chengyu, the head of the Ship Transportation Management Center of the Nanjing Maritime Safety Administration, found it in the monitoring, watching it flexibly escape many large ships and traffic at high speeds on the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tang Xiaofan, director of the Party and Mass Work Department of the Nanjing Maritime Safety Administration, said that although there were many vessels connected by the channel at that time, the wild pigs would not cause the ship to be damaged, but the wild boar was not damaged. It is easy to die. For the staff of the Maritime Bureau, large wild animals like wild boars appear rarely in the river surface, and more common are wildlife such as porpoons and birds. In terms of wildlife protection, they mainly cooperate with the Nanjing Municipal Government departments to delineate the ecological protection zone, forbidden navigation in the ecological reserve, and reduce water quality pollution in the Yangtze River. They do not need to deal with wild boar traffic accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; After the rescue &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; A reporter from the Southern Weekend found that in November 2023, there were many wild pigs in Nanjing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 1st, a woman in Jiangning District, Nanjing sat at the door of the restaurant and met wild boars and quickly fled into the store. The restaurant owner said that the aunt in the restaurant was not bitten, and the wild boar left quickly, and they did not call the police. On November 10, the media reported that Mr. Zhou, a citizen of Nanjing, collided with a wild boar while driving, and his vehicle was damaged. Mr. Zhou told the southern weekend that the wild boar was injured after being hit, and passers -by called the Hongshan Zoo Wildlife Acceptance Rescue Center to drag it away. The subsequent friends of Mr. Zhou asked the wild boar treatment and learned that the wild boar could not be saved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly called the Nanjing Public Security Bureau to ask the wild boar police situation on December 1 and failed to get a reply. On the website of the Nanjing Municipal Government, a reporter from the southern weekend found that a report was published on July 5, 2022. The Nanjing Garden Greening Bureau&#39;s response to the Nanjing People&#39;s Congress on the proposal of wild boars in rural areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The answer mentioned that in recent years, due to the improvement of the ecological environment, the number of wild pig species in Nanjing has grown rapidly, and the scope of activities has continued to expand. Wild pigs are not. The news of wild boars out of the mountain forests, frequently entered the news of tourist attractions, parks, transportation roads, residential communities, shopping malls, campuses, etc., which has been reported to destroy crops, destroy facilities, and even cause personal injury. One of the hidden dangers of safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From January to May 2022, the Nanjing Public Security Bureau reported a total of 201 parts involving wild boar police conditions, covering many administrative districts in the city, mainly for the traffic accidents caused by the accident caused by the accident, and the invasion of wild boars invaded the wild pig wait. Faced with such alarm situation, the territorial public security organs all sent members to the scene for the first time to deal with it. If the situation is critical and possibly threatened the public&#39;s personal safety, after the on -site evaluation and other standardized processes Work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Feng remembers that in 2022, the number of wild boars in Hongshan Zoo was 32, and it was reduced by ten in 2023. He believes that it is about to be removed from the wild boar from the &quot;three&quot; protective animals. In July 2023, the State Forestry and Grassland Bureau officially released the adjustment of the &quot;Land Wild Animal List with important ecology, science, and social value&quot;, and the wild boar is not in this list. This means that wild boars are no longer protecting animals, and further simplify the procedures for wild boar hunting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Feng suggested that if the citizens encounter wild boars on the streets and parks, they don&#39;t have to panic. They can be far away from it without being hurt. If there is already an emergency that hurts people and invades the lives of residents, citizens can call the police or call the wildlife rescue center call. After the Redshan Zoo rescue wild animals, it will make an evaluation. Foreign species will stay in the park to raise, and the local species will be about 40%of the fields of home species. &quot;This success rate is quite high.&quot; The rescue process of wild animals is prone to various accidents, such as accidentally drowning after anesthesia in the South Hubei River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Feng deliberately mentioned a wild boar rescued from Bazi Mountain Park in 2022. The wild boar has become very docile because of being raised for a long time, and people can even touch it. Hongshan Zoo is worried that it has no survivability in the wild and has been raising in the zoo. &quot;Some tourists are unclear. He thinks that feeding these animals is to protect it, and it actually hurts it.&quot; Li Feng and the team also rescued two wild boars that were fed near the Zhongshan Mausoleum in 2023, and eventually failed to release. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Faced with the increase in the number of wild boars, Nanjing adopted the methods of strengthening the survey of population groups, strengthening the prevention and publicity guidance of wild boar activities. In addition, the Nanjing Garden Greening Bureau has also adopted the method of regulating wild pig species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The above -mentioned Nanjing Garden Greening Bureau responded that Nanjing City has launched a pilot of wild boar hazards prevention and control work in the Zijinshan area since October 2021. After the expert evaluation and demonstration, the density of the wild pig species in the Zijinshan Monitoring Area has exceeded the control standard. The Nanjing Greening Garden Bureau applied to the Provincial Forestry Bureau for 60 wild pig hunting and hunting limits, and issued an administrative license to the huntering wild boar to the Zhongshan Cemetery Administration. From March 22, 2022 to March 15, 2023, it was launched in the Zijin Mountain area. Wild pig population regulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Feng believes that in recent years, the public has improved the awareness of wildlife protection. Citizens will take the initiative to call for help when they encounter wildlife trapped and wild animals. In 2022, Hongshan Zoo rescued about 1,200 animals, &quot;a wild boar is just a small wave.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 18:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[信用卡质效榜：股份行霸榜前四 城商行高度分化]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261776]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-03 17:34:12 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Heming Three years later, three years later, the domestic credit card market will be opened to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On November 19, 2023, the International Credit Card Organization Giant MasterCard obtained a bank card liquidation business license at the China Holdings Company Monthly, and said it was called Within 6 months, they will expand member institutions in China to authorize the issuance and acceptance of the bank card of the MasterCard brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At this time, the Chinese credit card market has shifted from the horsesy circle of the horse-rail-ups to refinement.

There are 6 sub -indicators at this dimension, which are credit card issuance and their changes, credit card loan balances and their proportion, the number of credit card users, and credit card transaction volume. The 6 sub -indicator rights coincide 35%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; (2) Risk management is a necessary dimension to examine the comprehensive strength of each bank&#39;s credit card. There are three sub -indicators in this dimension, which are non -performing loan balances, non -performing loans and changes in credit cards. The total right of three sub -indicators coincides with a total of 18%. Among them, in order to highlight the efforts and effects of banks to control loan adverse rates, on the basis of credit card loan adverse rate indicators, the change rate indicators of credit card loan adverse rates directly reflect the effectiveness of various banks&#39; measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; (3) Customer service and product innovation is an inevitable choice for major banks to respond to the increasingly fierce market competition in credit cards. There are three sub -indicators in this dimension, which are bank card handling fees income, credit card complaints and their changes. The total weight of the three sub -indicators is 17%. Among them, the number of credit card business complaints and their changes can counter the customer&#39;s recognition of the bank&#39;s credit card business, which is a negative indicator.

It is the only way to get expert review and media factors &quot;double full scores&quot;. Bank of. The bank won the championship with a 12 -point leading advantage, reflecting the competitiveness of the bank&#39;s credit card in various aspects such as business, finance and word of mouth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; CITIC Bank won the Guangfa Bank with a weak advantage of 0.24 points, and the two joint-stock banks ranked the credit card quality list runner-up and the third place. Coupled with the fourth -ranking Ping An Bank, in the 2023 new financial competitiveness list released this time, the credit card quality list is also the only sub -list with the top four of the list of dominations by the joint -stock bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Although external review scoring and media factors have weakened the influence of scale indicators on the list, it is only performed from quantitative qualitative indicators. The score is still the top three. Among them, the balance of credit card loans in Guangfa Bank accounted for 48%of the bank&#39;s personal loan balance, far exceeding the industry, which proves that the credit card business has a huge influence on the bank that has beyond the industry. At the same time, in the case of the overall contraction of credit card card issuance, CITIC Bank and Guangfa Bank&#39;s issuing card volume remains positive, which also shows the good strength of the two joint -stock banks in the credit card business. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The five major lines are among the top ten &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Although the three major banks have not been shortlisted, all the five major banks in the construction of diplomatic relations between the workers and peasants are among the top ten There is a big bank&#39;s overall strength in the credit card business. The state -owned bank credit card business started earlier, and the customer foundation was huge, and the scale of credit card business has been significantly ahead. However, in recent years, with the fluctuation of credit card assets and the strict supervision of the new rules of credit cards, the invalid and inefficient credit card issued in the early stage has withdrawn from the market. In this long, the scale of large banks in various countries has gradually been ironed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The importance of credit card business to a state-owned bank is not as good as a joint-stock bank. From the perspective of credit card loans in personal loans, the average proportion of credit card loans of the five major banks is 9%, while this indicator of 9 joint -stock banks is as high as 27%. In this sense, under the circumstances that the entry time, the scale of assets, and the customer base are in the overall disadvantage, the joint -stock bank can occupy half of the country in the credit card market, and the comprehensive competitiveness of the opponent is obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Therefore, the ranking of the five major banks in the credit card quality list is just right. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Head City Commercial Bank is catching up &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; 5 city commercial bank credit card scores are highly differentiated. Among them, Ningbo Bank&#39;s comprehensive score is second only to ICBC, ranking 6th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the first half of 2023, the bank&#39;s credit card issuance volume increased by 40%year-on-year, ranking first in 20 banks; The non -performing rate of credit cards is only 1.19%, which performs the best in the industry. While maintaining an ultra -low credit card adverse rate, the bank&#39;s credit card adverse rate is still on the downward channel, which is even more difficult. This reflects that the head city commercial bank is trying to catch up in the credit card business, and has made great progress on some indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Compared to Bank of Ningbo, the other four city commercial bank scores rank at the tail, showing that they still have a significant gap with large and medium-sized banks in terms of credit card comprehensive strength. Affected by factors such as the short time of the credit card market, the smaller business scale, and the weaker customer foundation, the four city commercial banks overall have lagged more on indicators such as credit card issuance and credit card loan balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 17:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[鸟兽、巫气与万物：一位北方作家来到大陆最南端]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261772]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-03 17:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/da1pphxcp4g16ci6bvenqh1zaktptpt80Myy4jim.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm/medias/imagagagag e/23/11/29/da1pphxcp4g16ci6bvenQH1ZAKTPT80MYY4JIM. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 260003 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; Half of the ocean, half of the land &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Leizhou Peninsula, at the southernmost tip of mainland China, each other across Hainan Island. Writer Sun Bin came here for two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When he arrived on the island, Sun Frequent kept walking and kept looking at each plant, every animal. She talked to locals of different ages and learned some Leizhou dialect. &quot;Eating&quot; is &quot;exemption&quot;, &quot;fault&quot; is &quot;top dwelling&quot;, and he is the most likely to be a northerner to perceive the temperament and character of this soil and soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The &quot;witch&quot; temperament is filled with the Leizhou Peninsula. Tianhou Palace and Mazu Temple are everywhere, and each village has all kinds of gods. &quot;Faced with the huge things like the ocean, humans must not be in awe, and they must ask for its blessing.&quot; The worship of the many gods derived from the ocean and its derived has penetrated into many details in the daily life of the beach. &quot;The folk customs here are The folk customs are particularly strange. I am curious about these, so I had this idea at the time. I wanted to write a place at the junction of the sea and land. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In the novel&quot; Seaside Magician &quot;published in 2023, the novel&quot; Seaside Magician &quot;,, the Season Magician, the Sea Magician,, Sun Ban fictional constructed a seaside village at the southernmost town of Leizhou Peninsula: Papaya Town. The first collection of novels, &quot;Seaside Magician&quot;, tells a northerner who came here to find her brother who disappeared for many years. For Sun Bin, searching is a very charming process. &quot;You keep going on the road, I don&#39;t know what kind of people will encounter in front of you and what kind of story.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; So, the northerner met an old lady who made her not to scare the jackfruit. &quot;Jackfruit is very attached to people, and I like to touch and praise them.&quot; Holding the leaf cake to the grave in the woods, I believe that the dead soul of her family is living on the black cat; she also encounters a person who looks like a carp essence. In order to let her believe in her words, the carp essence is facing The Mazu worshiped in the house is like burning incense and worshiping God. &quot;I tell you in front of Mazu, there will be no false words.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;In this town, many borders are blurred, Between people and plants, animals, between living and dead people, between the ground and the ground, they can shuttle with each other. >; &quot;There is a deserted temperament here so far. On the one hand, it is a knife to cut people, and the blood splashes five feet. In the same way, the gods celebrate the grand festival of the villagers on their birthdays. They are collectively called the annual calendar. They must sing a thunderic drama on the stage, to worship the wine to the gods, prepare fresh white -cut chicken, and put a whole day of firecrackers. To dance the lion, there must be a very solemn swimming ceremony, and God just sat in his own temple and quietly watching people wish them life for it. &quot; , Stkaiti; &quot;>;&quot; Seaside Magician &quot;&lt;/span>;) &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Naturally, life is fruit. Accompanied by the sea all day, the folk life of the Leizhou Peninsula stacks a layer of dreamy and mysterious atmosphere, and it is hidden behind this is the huge weakness and loneliness of humans when facing the ocean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When I first met the sea, there was no difference between Sun Zhan and many inland people. &quot;It&#39;s too big, so that you don&#39;t know what it is hidden inside.&quot; For living in land In terms of people, land means a stable life. Walking and living on land, living ancestral halls, build ancestral temples, generations of generations. And what exactly does sea life look like? Facing the huge, mysterious and unknown sea, how should people settle their own sea life that is destined to wander &quot;rootless&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Running back and forth, from Xu Wengang to Haikou, Sun Bar has more than a dozen ships in total to try to chat with the crew. Crews are often silent, especially ocean crews. The sea sailing at sea for a year or two makes them lose contact with friends on the land, and people on the land have gradually forgot their existence. &quot;This kind of life on board is split with land. They become a world and one on the world.&quot; When talking to Sun Bin, a captain claimed to be &quot;sea people&quot;. She noticed the particularity of this word. &quot;Not the crew, nor the seafarers, but the sea people.&quot; &quot;This distinction is no longer professional, but the split from the fundamental standpoint of people.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This loneliness is ultimately the end of What do you go? Sun Duan found that after catching the expensive fish, some fishermen will take the money selling fish to the city center, find a hotel to open a house, eat some delicious food, and then go back to fish after spending the money. She heard that many ocean crew members would also do this. When the ocean ship was supplied by the offshore, they would go out of the ship to buy things desperately. Sun Duan tried to explain the source of this kind of compensation psychology. &quot;For example, a fisherman may be dead to drive a boat out of the sea. Under such impermanence, once you have the opportunity to get rid of or relax, you will desperately want to compensate themselves. &quot;&quot; Or is it very simple, you can spend money quickly, in case I will be dead tomorrow. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The sea is silent, and the sea people are silent. The boat is like a natural prison. &quot;Because of the narrow space and the departure of its land, it is likely to become a prison, and the crew will become a prisoner to endure the torture.&quot; &quot;But, can we change to another? To understand it from an angle? This closed and isolated space can actually become a Thorro -style hut, a unique space suitable for philosophical mysteries? &quot;In the second&quot; Seagull Knight &quot;in the novel collection, Sun Zu fictional Captain, wearing a suit, combing back, burning incense, drinking tea, and playing the piano every day. &quot;He is still elegant in the place where no one is, just like a ghost dormant in the old castle ... He is sometimes easy -going, sometimes very again Occasionally a little fierce, when I feel good, I will talk elegantly in literature and art, and there is a kind of things between noble and gloom. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; She wants to ask How can we find a wider and richer spiritual space for yourself in such a closed and lonely environment? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/itb5uciqfpil5adf64gmrgujvfqr2x1szlqjpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;820&quot; height = &quot;960&quot; data-src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/itb5uciqfpil5adf64gmrgujvfqr2x1szlqjpg&quot; data-key = &quot;2599996&quot; &quot;&quot; >; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; At the seam of civilization &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Two years ago, Sun Zone&#39;s novel &quot;In the name of birds and beasts&quot; was published, and Fan Xiaoshe&#39;s editor of the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House first edited Sun Zone&#39;s book for the first time. &quot;Whether she writes the grand and dense plants in the south, the rich aquatic products in the ocean, or the unmanned dense forest in the north, these things are just the material of Sun Zan&#39;s novels,&quot; Fan Xiaoshe said. &quot;And in the end all novels are directed by modern times, all of them are modern times. Civilization (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; modernization, urbanization &lt;/span>;) gives people&#39;s inner impact, and find or ask at the same time. &quot;&lt;/P >; &lt;p>; In &quot;The Name of Birds and Beasts&quot;, Sun Fan set his gaze to the people in Luliang Mountain, his hometown. There, the modern urban civilization is constantly entering this &quot;wild&quot; land. Sun Zhan shaped a mountain tour, and he walked out of the mountain and had a decent civil servant job in the town. But this profession has not provided him with a source of identity, &quot;his roots are still in the mountains.&quot; In Sun Zu&#39;s view, what You Xiaolong represented was the suffering of some people in the process of urbanization, &quot;they The soul is nowhere to be placed, the hometown can no longer go back, and the city does not belong to itself. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>;&quot; Don&#39;t you think this is the epitome of a large part of China? &quot; Coming, &quot;Of course, urbanization is a must -have stage for the development of human society. But in fact, every step of the era requires hundreds of millions of life blood and tears.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The attention of urbanization also continues To the third episode of the new novel, &quot;Falling Sun Coral&quot;. In the novel, Sun Ban carefully recorded the urbanization process of Papaya Town: In the 1980s, 100,000 talents went to Hainan, and the nation of Papaya Town became a hawker. In the 1990s, Wenzhou speculation groups allowed smuggling cars to invade and devour the entire town ; When Hainan Island scratched the trend of travel and vacation, Papaya Town scrambled to run coral homestays ... between cities and towns, Sun Bin once again chose the seam of civilization as the perspective of her thinking. The protagonist of the novel &quot;I&quot; once moved from Papaya Town to the city. &quot;It was pursuing modern civilization, but he couldn&#39;t really enter the city.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Under the change of migration, Sun Zhan always watched the spiritual situation that was not limited by the region, and it had some kind of universal &quot;loneliness&quot; -the personal spirit that was difficult to place in modern civilization and turbulence. As a result, Fan Xiaoshe said that &quot;looking back&quot; not only constituted the fundamental questioning of modern civilization, but also the inherent inherently inherently inherent in Sun Zan&#39;s self -life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For the &quot;post -80s&quot; generation of Sun Byn, she feels that every change in the times has an impact on her and her generation. She witnessed the laid -off workers in her childhood, and became a &quot;hard -working town as a questioner&quot; in her childhood. &quot;When I graduated, the sense of superiority of college students who still existed in the 1990s had gone, and college students turned into a dust.&quot; When she was in college, she would still think, &quot;This has entered the 21st century. Why is it? What preparation and non -compilation work exist. &quot;After working for a short time, her thoughts changed, and the cruel reality of society seemed to teach her what life was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;All I experienced, and every step of the society, must have impact on me. And in the process, I kept thinking about it, thinking about each tide of the era. The individual&#39;s threat, &quot;When these thoughts slowly accumulated,&quot; you want to express it. &quot;Sun Bin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After graduating from college, Sun Zone successively published a collection of novels &quot;Pain&quot;, &quot;Salt&quot; and &quot;Crack&quot;. Many readers and critics noticed the pain of the mind and spirit in the work. &quot;Because I really feel that pain, I can write it out, so I invested in high concentrations of emotions in the early novels.&quot; Sun Duan said. Like the name of the novel, these creations revealed the confrontation between a young man, the society, the world, and the spiritual situation that he could not reconcile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Looking back at his creation in his twenties, Sun Zhan feels normal, which is in line with the mood of a young man at that time and her understanding of the world. &quot;Society&quot;, followed by the weak helplessness of the individual, and the sudden break and impact when facing the ivory tower built from literary education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;It&#39;s just that I can&#39;t be desperately burning my emotions like 20 years old. My novel at the age of 20 pays attention to the deep and struggling hearts of young women. As I get older, I will try to understand more people and pay attention to the wider world, so that it is interesting. The writer is burning himself throughout his life, but later, what I have burned is no longer just emotion. Instead, when I understand this broad world. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; When editing&quot; The name of birds and beasts &quot;, Fan Xiaoshe felt that Sun Zone&quot; began to become open. &quot; She believes that when &quot;Pain&quot;, &quot;Salt&quot; and &quot;Crack&quot;, she pays more attention to the pain of individuals. Starting from &quot;The Name of Birds and Beasts&quot;, she has made some museums, plants, mountains and rivers, including behind them. The history of history has been brought out. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The writing of anthropology inspired her. In anthropology, Sun Bin saw a deeper and more perspective of human beings. She wrote &quot;The Name of Birds and Beasts&quot;, using anthropology to handle the changes in mountains, the history of grass and trees, and mountains and rivers, and deeply describe the evolution of the lives of mountain people between cities and mountains and forests. The long -lasting sight of this world of human and human beings is full of patience and full of &quot;the greatest respect for different people.&quot; And when she looked at these mountains, fishermen, and sea people with the same patience, and these &quot;wild&quot; people in the eyes of urban civilization, she practically appreciated her unique vitality. She wrote all kinds of strange strange mountain people in &quot;Riding the White Horse&quot;, and brought the younger bachelor brothers with a big bachelor to run a short man in the farmers&#39; university in the mountains ... &quot;You see their living conditions are actually very difficult, You can also describe them with a barren, &quot;Sun Fan said.&quot; But, their language and their ideas are full of vitality. That kind of vitality does not belong to cities and civilization, but it is also sincere and moving. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/m1e2goklujsxdouwgx9k0tdrgcw43m.png&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 322232 3232 32 width = &quot;322232 3222 3222 322232 1 &quot;Height =&quot; 428 &quot;data -Src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/m1e2goklClujsxuWGXUWEBVLGV9k0TDRGCW43M.PNG&quot; Data-key = &quot;260004&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot; color: #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; Sun Zan&#39;s style at the seaside of the Port of Xuwen &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (provided by the interviewee/picture) A broader world &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; At the scene of the new book sharing session of &quot;Seaside Magic&quot;, the writer Li Jingze said: &quot;Although Sun Zone&#39;s creation has changed a lot, I think her direction has really not changed. There has always been an intention to establish a connection between people and all things. This is particularly important. One of the usual situations in Sun Zhan&#39;s novels is that when walking, there are fewer and few people, there are fewer people, and everything is born. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With the age of age, Sun Fan found that his interest in people was not so great. &quot;When there is a lot of disappointment with human or human nature, or not deep comfort in the crowd, the complex relationship between people is gradually becoming a forceful space, which will restrain people.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; She goes to know plants, animals, those rivers she passes by, and people who can&#39;t talk to those who can&#39;t talk to their calls and try to understand them. &quot;This is a very interesting process in itself,&quot; said Sun Duan, &quot;Because you are gradually understanding the world, which is actually very healed for people living in high -rise buildings.&quot; When she came from the city to the mountains and forests from the city forest The changes in the ocean and the region affect the mood of the person in it. &quot;You will become more and more tolerant.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The turning of this life mood eventually changed her creation. &quot;My early novels were entangled in the relationship between people, and later I was a little tired of this writing,&quot; Sun Duan said. &quot;I don&#39;t mean to write down like this.我觉得每个作家的尝试方向，一定有个前提就是，让自己觉得舒展和愉悦，并对作者自身具有疗愈和滋养的功能。一个人不可能说，我写作是去服苦役，去写那些自己不愿意写的东西，哪怕这能给作家本人带来更多的名声。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙频想象着自己成为了《海鸥骑士》中虚构的船长，试图创造一个更好的、更大的精神空间——“因为写作本身就是对自己的疗愈、对自己的安放。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在那一刻，我想，如果真的万物有灵，那一个人死了之后，只是离开了人类社会，却进入了一个更加阔大的世界，在那个世界里，植物、动物、山川、河流、日月、海洋、飓风、神灵、亡魂、妖魅、精灵都是可以互相交流的。这种交流无法被活着的人看到，但在那些孤独的、有创伤的人身上，却多少露出了一些痕迹……”（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《海边魔术师》&lt;/span>;）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“逃避和安顿是同时存在的，”孙频说，“你可以把这种逃避理解为因人对现实和物质世界的无力感而产生的逃避，但同时在这个逃避的过程中，你也为自己构造出了一个新的世界，一个属于万物的世界，不再局限在人类，而是在天地之间。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;追问依然存在。樊晓哲认为，孙频的创作始终在处理她内心的困惑，“首先她觉得现代文明下人与人之间的沟通是有困难的，于是她产生了困惑”，“在《疼》《盐》《裂》里，她从个体感受出发，不断地去书写困惑”，“到了后面，她进一步去追问困惑的来源，这到底是人的问题，还是社会的问题？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“到了现在这个阶段，她没有在人群中寻找答案，而是到万物中去寻找。”在那些现代文明的边缘地带，没有人知道的山林与海岛深处，那些航船、水手、山民和鸟兽，都是自洽的。 “在万物中，她的困惑得到了稀释和缓解，或者说疗愈。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙频喜欢艾米莉·狄金森的诗歌里“精灵式的气质”，也喜欢沈从文的写作，这样的文字气息是她所向往的状态，“在他那里，人与自然万物之间没有痕迹地融合，非常舒畅、自然的缝合和连接。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 17:25:12 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[尼泊尔爆发抗议：君主与共和之争？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261760]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;“Whistles sounded frequently at the scene, and a large number of police officers gathered together.

The sound of the car starting kept making a loud sound, and many people gathered around to watch.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recalling the scene a few days ago, the Nepali Mata still remembers it fresh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 23, 2023, thousands of people came to Kathmandu, Nepal, to hold a large-scale demonstration. &quot;Restore the monarchy, abolish the republic,&quot; chanted protesters in Kathmandu, Nepal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to local police estimates, about 9,000 people participated in the protest called by Durga Prasai, a former member of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and medical entrepreneur. Although police described the demonstration as &quot;largely peaceful,&quot; two workers suffered minor injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Addressing the crowd later that afternoon, Prasai urged his supporters to break through the security cordon and march towards Maitigal. Police then used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the crowd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As political competition between the current republic and the pro-monarchy has intensified recently, the Nepali government has deployed about 10,000 security personnel from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and investigators to prevent the two groups from interfering. possible conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The capital is &quot;in chaos&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhu Ming opened a restaurant in Nepal. He told Southern Weekend reporters that Nepal is an overall peaceful country, but in terms of certain political needs, Nepal There would be riots from time to time. Nowadays there are local police on every main street to maintain order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young man Kariqi remembers clearly that the protest conflict took place at an intersection in the capital. People gathered and ran at the scene, and police sirens were heard continuously. “There was the sound of some kind of gunshots being fired, and there was an obvious Smoke Trail”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On that day, the local police fired 146 tear gas canisters and 5 rubber bullets to disperse Plase supporters in Barku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse, who claims to be a maverick and has been adhering to anti-government and anti-corruption stances in recent times, said in a speech at the rally that Prime Minister Prachanda failed to rule the country and the country was heading towards bankruptcy and demanded that &quot;He surrendered to the people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse also claimed that his supporters would continue to hold protests elsewhere and would ignore Kathmandu&#39;s ban. Earlier, the government declared the Baneshwar stretch of Maiti as a no-go zone for protests. He said his campaign would not stop until the monarchy, the Hindu state and the 1990 constitution were restored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse has long been considered a &quot;controversial&quot; businessman who is trying to overthrow Nepal&#39;s current government and calls the protests a &quot;national rescue operation.&quot; He said the protests were against the government&#39;s failure to curb anarchy, corruption and rising inflation. Prashay wanted to restore the monarchy and the Hindu state by abolishing the current federal, republican and secular institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also asked for the support of businessmen in the capital at the protest site, asking them to close their businesses from November 24. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The youth wing of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist), the Rastiya Youth Party, and its student wing, the Nepal National Free Students Union, also participated in the demonstration in Tinkun. There are also many protesters who came to Kathmandu from the southern plains of Nepal. They are also &quot;victims&quot; of bank microfinance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse said that banks are trying their best to exploit borrowers&#39; money and called on people to give up their loans in banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, demonstrators supporting the current republican regime also took to the streets. They believe that only a republic can guarantee social justice and equality and &quot;allow everyone to have the opportunity to realize their dreams and pursuits.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the scene of the conflict, pro-monarchy protesters and counter-protesters clashed. The anger of the protesters spread from Barku, the designated protest area, to various areas such as Tinkunne, Garigaon, Sundara, Thapatali, Fudong and other key points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Kathmandu police arrested a total of 261 protesters, set up roadblocks and water cannons on the streets, and installed closed-circuit television to monitor Praset&#39;s supporters around the clock. Police have also deployed additional sniffer dogs around the conflict site and on rooftops to ensure safety and prevent possible incidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in order to prevent conflicts between rival groups, the police designated two different protest areas. But the opposition between those who support the monarchy and those who support the republic is huge and will lead to heightened tensions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Zhu Ming said that the protests had little impact on local life. Because the protesters marched in designated areas, except for traffic closures during the march, other areas including the main business district and the World Tourist Center were not affected, and shops were open for business normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Political systems in conflict&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nepal, nestled in the Himalayas, has a rich and colorful culture, natural landscape and political history. But its political system evolved over the centuries, from a feudal monarchy to a federal democratic republic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu, an associate researcher at the Institute of South Asia at Sichuan University, said that the current republic has indeed achieved certain positive results since its establishment, including the expansion of people&#39;s democratic rights and more protections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the beginning of the 21st century, Nepalese politics underwent major changes. In 2006, Nepal&#39;s civil war ended and the government and rebels signed a peace agreement. Two years later, in 2008, Nepal officially declared itself a federal democratic republic, abolished the monarchy, the head of state became the president, and power was dispersed among the central government, federal state governments, and local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the Nepali government began to formulate a new constitution and established a federal system. Nepal is divided into seven federal states, each of which has a certain degree of autonomy and is responsible for managing its own affairs. This constitution-making process went through many political crises and protests, but was finally adopted in 2015 and became the current constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are mainly two groups of people who are dissatisfied with the republic.” Zeng Xiangyu said that one group of people are young people who have grown up with modern education and have more expectations for the country. Another group of people are those who have experienced the monarchy era. They believe that although the monarchy has many shortcomings, politicians can at least compete within a limited range and achieve general stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu said that modern politics in Nepal is still in the process of being cultivated. The current chaos is not due to problems with the political system itself, but due to problems with the politician class, which leads to the operation of the current system. There are many problems and there is a lot of dissatisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Political instability has plagued Nepal since the end of the monarchy, with more than a dozen changes of government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu said that although there is currently no situation similar to previous civil wars in Nepal, the political arena has long been trapped in party disputes and the political situation has been unstable for a long time. Political parties continue to divide and change their policies, leaving voters disappointed. Voters hope to establish a stable government through elections and put the country on the right track, but politicians often use votes as bargaining chips in party political negotiations, causing strong dissatisfaction among voters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Politically unstable and economic development has slowed, millions of young people have left the country in search of work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu told Southern Weekend reporters that Nepal’s economic development has been slowing down and the people are in an extremely confused and trapped state. Many people who study abroad or are active abroad are unwilling to come back. Some young people prefer to work in the Gulf or India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recent protests have also shown the disputes and differences within Nepali society over the political system. Clearly, Nepali politics still faces some challenges and problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Ming sometimes &quot;chats&quot; with protesters. He said the protesters&#39; real demand was a return to the days of king power. &quot;Because only the king will think about the people.&quot; He said that the protesters believe that no matter which party they are, they represent their own interests and will be bribed by different international forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many political forces in Nepal, behind which are the behind-the-scenes interest transactions of various political parties.” Zeng Xiangyu believes that although this is a shortcoming of the current republican system, it is different from the previous fierce confrontation or civil war era. Than, &quot;It&#39;s always better&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Are the &quot;curry smell&quot; protests effective? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that conflicts and violent protests have occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kathmandu police said that on the afternoon of September 7, 2023, 47-year-old Shyam Sapkota attacked Yadav, co-general secretary of the Nepali Congress Party, in Kathmandu. He suffered deep cuts on the back of his neck and was taken to hospital for treatment by police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, a video circulated on social media showed Sapkota shouting for the restoration of the country&#39;s monarchy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2020, pro-monarchy and pro-Hindu activists marched on the streets of Kathmandu, demanding the restoration of the monarchy and Nepal as a Hindu country, and the abolition of the federal system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Controversy over the constitutional system has always existed. It has been dragged on for many years and has not yet been completely resolved.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is noteworthy that Nepal is a multi-ethnic country, and there are tensions and differences between different ethnic and social groups. Some local people are dissatisfied with the federal demarcation and distribution of autonomy, which has led to protests and political unrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that as a federal country in Nepal, the relationship between the central government and the provinces, as well as how to name the provinces and where the capital is located, are all issues that have caused huge controversy. &quot;In the era of the king, there were As the controversial issue continues to this day, the controversy becomes even greater.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Nepal&#39;s political status quo remains turbulent. There are serious differences in political philosophy between supporters of the monarchy and the republic. This opposition is not limited to ideology, but also involves the people&#39;s views on the future of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Nepal&#39;s political parties, especially the mainstream political parties, are dividing and forming groups very quickly, and they focus entirely on political interests.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu commented that each political party does not regard specific policies that are beneficial to the country as its work Instead, he is keen on party struggle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the march, Zhu Ming asked those participating in the protest &quot;whether they will succeed.&quot; The answer he got was &quot;yes.&quot; But judging from the current results, &quot;there is a high probability that it has not achieved its goal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu said that Nepal’s political situation will not undergo major fluctuations due to this protest, and will continue on its original track. Several political parties are divided into groups, and for the sake of political interests, they will continue to &quot;you sing and I will &quot;Debut&quot;, there will be no major breakthroughs in economic and social development for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Democracy and republic cannot make mistakes.” Regarding this protest, Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) Oli said that individual people in power may make mistakes, but this does not mean that the entire system is defective . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oli said the restoration of the monarchy was unthinkable. Just as humans cannot go back to the Stone Age, we cannot go back to monarchy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The goals of the protesters are impossible to achieve.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that the monarchy is a thing of the past and does not conform to the trend of the times. It is more of an emotional expression and a reflection of the status quo. protest. &quot;It is almost impossible to achieve the goal of restoring the monarchy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this kind of protest may be an opportunity for Nepal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is a reminder to Nepal’s political class.” Zeng Xiangyu said, “More than ten years have passed, and the people will miss the monarchy and vent their dissatisfaction with the status quo, which is worthwhile in itself. Reflection. In Nepal, there are now some emerging political parties that represent the voices of young people and have achieved good results. But if they want to replace traditional political parties, they still have a long way to go.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 16:55:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王贤才丨两次焚稿，九译其书：我翻译《希氏内科学》的历程]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261714]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/12/02/e8b0f8c820.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1611&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/ 02/e8b0f8c820.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260450&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At the beginning of this century, Wang Xiancai and his wife Zeng Hanying revisited their birthplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My ancestral home is Yongan Township, Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province. In the 1920s, my grandfather moved the family to Shanghai. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933)&lt;/span>; the sixteenth day of the ninth lunar month, I was born in &quot;Jianye Lane&quot;, Fululi Road, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(now Jianguo West Road)&lt;/span>; in the French Concession in Shanghai. October 30, 2023 is my 90th birthday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When my wife Zeng Hanying and I revisited our former residence at the beginning of this century, Jianyeli had become a dilapidated building and was about to be demolished and rebuilt, and the residents had all moved out. The guard asked about the purpose of his visit and allowed me, an old resident, to go in and walk around, leaving this photo at the door of the alley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 1946, I returned to Jiujiang with my parents and lived in the ancestral house bought by my grandfather on Dutian Lane. It was an old house with two front and back floors. When Jiujiang was liberated in May 1949, I was a freshman in Tongwen Middle School. In the spring of 1951, when he was about to enter his junior year of high school, he was ordered to study at the Central South Youth League School in Wuhan &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Jiangxi Province was then part of the Central South District)&lt;/span>;. When I returned from graduation in July, the Communist Youth League Committee asked me to stay in the student department and formally join the workforce. The pace of life slows down. I was not used to the life of a government cadre. At this time, the first unified entrance examination for colleges and universities across the country had passed. Suddenly I found that Shandong University School of Medicine had to recruit students separately, so I asked to resign and study further. The student minister agreed, but the organization minister believed that this was caused by bourgeois individualism, and he refused to obey the organization&#39;s decision and ordered him to &quot;resign&quot; from the group. This was the first political blow I suffered and became my “original sin.” People of insight believe that the ups and downs I experienced in the first half of my life were all related to this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being forced to &quot;resign&quot; from the group, he bid farewell to his parents, sadly left home, and went to Qingdao to successfully enter the School of Medicine at Shanda University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f4d1658ee.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1541&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f4d1658ee.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Registration photo for Shandong University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although I have never thought about studying medicine, I have to do this, otherwise I will have to wait another year. Later I discovered that this passively accepted major also protected me to a great extent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because I paid a heavy price to get the opportunity to enter a higher education, I learned from the experience and worked harder than ever before. At that time, there were no textbooks in the university, so I mainly relied on taking notes during class. I listened attentively, requiring myself not only to understand, but also to remember in class. After class, I compiled notes from memory, and then supplemented them with Chinese and foreign materials I read in the library, so I learned more than what I heard in class. of more. I was the first in the class in every test score in all courses during college. Mr. Lu Yunming, professor of Physiology, made an exception and gave me 110 points on the 100% test paper because my answer exceeded what he taught in class. Thirty years later, I returned to Qingdao to attend the school anniversary event, and Mr. Lu happily mentioned this to me. Importantly, I also started my medical translation career at Shandong University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/729c561658.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/729c561658.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260452&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;While studying at Shandong University, I took photos on the Qingdao beachfront. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the clinical course, I learned that there is a world-renowned medical masterpiece &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; in the United States. The teachers jokingly called it the &quot;Das Kapital&quot; of clinical medicine. I went to the school library to register and queue up, and borrowed this heavy masterpiece. While reading and studying, I was deeply impressed by its profoundness, systematic and rigorous discussion, and its emphasis on the connection between clinical and basic theory, so I came up with the idea of ​​translating it into Chinese. I think this is a very meaningful thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I want to do it in two steps: first translate a smaller book, and then move on to that big book after gaining experience. Later, I chose &quot;An Approach to Clinical Surgery&lt;/em>;&quot; (&lt;em>;An Approach to Clinical Surgery&lt;/em>;) written by Professor HC Owens of the United Kingdom for interns and junior residents. I felt that the content of this book was It&#39;s something I can control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, whether I wanted to translate &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; or tried to translate this booklet, it was still a secret of mine at that time. There was only one close friend in the same class&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Liu Piren)&lt;/span>;Knowing this, he has always been optimistic about me and encouraged me, and even found a &quot;secret&quot; translation place for me, which is the small building on the roof of the third surgical ward. attic. It was a low, cramped small room covered with cobwebs and dust. I had to bend down to get in. The &quot;tables&quot; are stacked soap boxes, sitting on bricks wrapped in newspaper. I get up early every morning and hide here to translate books. There was no electricity in the attic, so candles were the only way to light it. My eyesight is not good. When I look closely, I often smell a burning smell, which means my hair is burning. I work until six or seven o&#39;clock and quietly return to the dormitory, keeping up with the rhythm of life of my classmates, washing, eating, and going to the ward together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/e53a0d5f09.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1662&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/e53a0d5f09.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260453&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photos from the time when I was secretly translating books in the attic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I kept a low profile and did a good job of keeping it secret. Until I finished translating this little book of more than 200,000 words, no one discovered my &quot;underground activities.&quot; In 1993, I returned to Qingdao to attend the anniversary event of my alma mater. Liu Jingru, my classmate who lived in the bunk below me at that time, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(then the director of Qingdao Municipal Health Bureau)&lt;/ span>;Admitted that he had no idea about these activities of mine at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/400851e4cb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1676&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/400851e4cb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260454&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1993, he returned to Qingdao Medical University to participate in the school anniversary event and took a photo with his old classmate Liu Jingru (middle) who was the director of Qingdao Health Bureau at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Instructions for Clinical Surgery&quot; was published by Shanghai Health Publishing House in 1957, I had already graduated and was working in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/cf8354f25c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1078&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/cf8354f25c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260455&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After this little book was published, I went through many ups and downs and almost lost everything. This is a used book I bought online. I accidentally found it on a used book website. At least it is still good. There have been three reprints: Shanghai Science and Technology Press (1960, 1961) and Hong Kong Commercial Press (1970). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Enter &quot;His&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The publication of &quot;Instructions for Clinical Surgery&quot; gave me great encouragement. I bought back the 9th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; and began to It marches on. This translation is not an &quot;underground activity&quot;. My colleagues all know that I am doing it. But I was unlucky, and soon the anti-rightist movement came. Although I got through 1957, the year when I became famous, without incident, because the hospital’s anti-rightist goals were not fulfilled, in June 1958, I was still classified as a rightist for “unreasonable opinions” on Soviet medicine. By this time, the anti-rightist climax had passed, and I and two other right-wing recruits were not sent out. We stayed in the hospital to supervise labor and were given a monthly living allowance of 32 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months later, the hospital was suddenly ordered to move to Hohhot, Inner Mongolia to support the local Great Leap Forward. The pressure I feel is also increasing. Finally, on a bright and clear night, the translated manuscript of the 9th edition of &quot;His&quot;, about 400,000 words, was burned in a wasteland next to the hospital. Although I felt very miserable, I could still convince myself that now was not the time to translate the book, and I had to work hard to take off this &quot;hat&quot; on my head. Science is always evolving, and a new version will come out when the time comes, and I will start over. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1960, I have been ordered to act as &quot;acting attending physician&quot;. Every morning, I lead the residents and interns in ward rounds. At this time, I am their superior. After the ward rounds, they return to the office and I sweep the floor, clean the tables, and empty the toilets for the patients. Whatever patients need me to do and I can do, I do it proactively. Because I am different from them, I am a right-winger under supervision. At that time, they were the enemies of the people, the &quot;reactionaries&quot;. So what I think about day and night and think about in my heart is &quot;taking off my hat&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking forward to the stars, looking forward to the moon, and finally looking forward to this day. In November 1961, the Party Committee of the Academy announced that I would be &quot;retired&quot;. At this time, the situation also changed a lot: the Soviet Union became the &quot;Soviet revisionist&quot; and the target of our criticism, and was no longer the &quot;big brother&quot;. I returned to my old business, bought the 11th edition of &quot;His&quot;, and started to study &quot;His&quot; again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as luck would have it, the &quot;Four Cleanups&quot; movement came again. The leader of the working group leading the movement warned me: Don’t relapse, as the “rightist” label can be put back on again after you take it off! These words hit home for me. I have to pull back from the brink! Finally, the re-translated 11th edition of the manuscript of &quot;His&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (also more than 400,000 words)&lt;/span>; was placed next to the hospital. The wasteland was set on fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A famous person once said that the most painful thing in life is waking up from a dream with no way out. When I am wearing the &quot;hat&quot;, I can dream about doing it again after taking off the &quot;hat&quot;. What path can I take now, what can I dream about? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life is sometimes cruel but also interesting: more than twenty years later, I was invited to return to Hohhot. When I was discussing with scientific and technical personnel in the Inner Mongolia Science and Technology Building, I discovered that this building is the same hospital where I used to work. Next, it was built on the wasteland where I burned manuscripts twice. I couldn’t help but tell them about this past event. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Upgrade again&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Four Clean-ups&quot; movement has not yet completely ended, but it has entered a decade of catastrophe. I was punished as a &quot;rightist without hats&quot; and upgraded to an &quot;active counterrevolutionary&quot;. I was sentenced to 12 years in prison, deprived of political rights for 4 years, and entered a labor camp. Fortunately, the authorities took advantage of my skills and allowed me to serve my sentence in the health department of the labor camp, avoiding regular labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1971, Cheng Dalu, a fellow prisoner who was released after serving his sentence, gave me a tightly wrapped &quot;gift&quot;. When I opened it, I saw that it was the 13th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;! Cheng Dalu was an educated youth from Shanghai who was transferred to Shanxi. He was sentenced to five years in prison for &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot; crimes. He was hospitalized here for a long time because of pleurisy. We get along well. He knew that I was determined to translate &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; and kept it in mind. At that time, it was stipulated that people who lived in big cities and along the coast could not go home after release and had to stay in the factory >;Employment. So he could take advantage of the fact that every day after the prisoners went to work and there were no guards in the cell, he could send me books. Cheng Dalu only has a &quot;salary&quot; of 29 yuan per month, and he also has to support his younger sister who is sent to Anhui. But after he discovered the newly released &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; (photocopy) in a foreign language bookstore, he tried every means and sold his clothes to buy it for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/b574c980bd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/b574c980bd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260456&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1984, we met again after the robbery on Hechengda Road in Jiujiang (left in the picture). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suddenly I saw the long-lost &quot;He&quot;, things have changed and people have changed, and the feeling in my heart is really indescribable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the prisoners go to work every day, they eat lunch at the construction site and do not return from work until 6 p.m. So I can read a book after I finish handling the affairs in the ward in the morning, and I can calm down by eight or nine o&#39;clock after I finish handling the patients sent by each team for consultation in the evening. I looked through the 13th edition of &quot;His&quot; and found that with the advancement of the times, the content is very different from previous editions. His Majesty himself has long since retired. There are 177 authors of this book. The chief editor is Professor Paul B. Beeson of Oxford University (later transferred to the University of Washington in the United States). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/c79b574a0b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1437&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/c79b574a0b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260457&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A signed photo given to me by Bison, chief editor of the 13th, 14th and 15th editions of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Translating books in prison&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but want to use this opportunity to translate books. I didn&#39;t do it impulsively or whimsically, but after careful consideration and serious consideration. Since I arrived at the labor camp, I have been conscientious and cautious in my work. I have never made any mistakes or had any medical accidents. Analytical balances, photoelectric colorimeter, and laboratory were established to perform clinical and biochemical tests carried out in general hospitals at the time One year&#39;s reward)&lt;/span>;, so the leader trusts me very much. I think I can win the support of the leadership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to regulations, cadres are not allowed to come to see me for medical treatment. However, starting from the factory leader and political commissar Li Hengwen, they often come to see me for medical treatment. Of course, I have no right to refuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Political Commissar Li came to see me again that day. He was about fifty years old at the time, a veteran anti-Japanese cadre and former public security chief. He often suffers from a slow heart rate and the cause is unknown. After careful examination and examination, I thought it was a manifestation of coronary heart disease. At that time when supplies were in short supply and people were generally malnourished, coronary heart disease was still very rare in China. Large hospitals occasionally saw a few cases of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, and the papers they wrote could be published in national academic journals. Doctors have little experience with this and have difficulty accessing foreign medical information. Later, hospitals outside the hospital also recognized my diagnosis, which also increased Political Commissar Li&#39;s trust in me and asked me how I came to have coronary heart disease from a slow heart rate. I took the opportunity to bring out the big book and said that it was what it told me and I wanted to translate it so that more Chinese doctors could read it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Commissar Li flipped through the big book but did not answer me. No words were spoken for a long time. I felt a little uneasy and should not have presumed to make this request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He closed the book and said to me: &quot;Since it is such a good book, you can translate it here. We support you. If the translation cannot be published, we will print it for you!&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That’s what he said, and I still remember it vividly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Learning &quot;Dumb Japanese&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In this way, I translated &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; for the third time in the labor camp, hoping to realize my wish as a student. Translating books in such a closed environment naturally presents many difficulties. Although there were many capable people among the reform-through-labor prisoners during that period, it was still difficult to find anyone to discuss the more professional issues. I remember that when I translated a piece of content about CT, I got stuck. Nowadays, CT is a household name, but at that time, CT had just come out. I couldn&#39;t guess from the two English words &quot;computerized tomography&quot; what this &quot;artifact&quot; for examination, referred to as CT, was , SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(literally &quot;computer-processed tomography&quot;)&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a message from prisoners in this city and ask their families to help find explanatory materials about CT. I finally found a copy and sent it in, but it was in Japanese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There happens to be a Japanese expert in the ward: Mr. Luo Yuanzhen, professor of the Department of History of Shanxi University. Mr. Luo studied at Waseda University in Japan in his early years and married a Japanese lady &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (suspected to be a &quot;Japanese spy&quot;)&lt;/span>;. He is a &quot;future&quot; &quot;Convicted criminals&quot; were also sent as the detention center was overcrowded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Mr. Luo, who is separated by lines and is proficient in Japanese, cannot read the Japanese information about CT, saying that you can only read it yourself; if you don’t understand Japanese, you can learn it. I&#39;m still a little hesitant: Is it too much to learn a foreign language just to read some Japanese information? Mr. Luo said that it can be done quickly: learn &quot;dumb Japanese&quot; and just read books, not speak or write articles, it only takes a few months. In that environment, there was no choice but this. So the translation was suspended and I started learning Japanese with Mr. Luo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/0f3bf689c9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1467&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/0f3bf689c9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260458&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;My Japanese teacher in prison, Mr. Luo Yuanzhen (1906-1993), a professor at Shanxi University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After daily rounds, I invite Mr. Luo to my room &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (should be said &quot;prison unit&quot;)&lt;/ span>;Come and learn Japanese. In less than a month, the &quot;dumb Japanese&quot; mastered Japanese and understood the Japanese information about CT, and then returned to the translation of &quot;His&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a night in late September 1975, the entire 13th edition of &quot;Historical Records&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (3.4 million words)&lt; /span>;The Chinese translation is finally completed. I put the final translation I wrote into the translated manuscript. There are 300 words per page, and the pages are numbered to more than 11,000 pages. The numbering is like a small mountain, trembling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My wish as a student has finally come true, but time has passed and I am no longer young. I am still translating books under such circumstances, which is sad! Although I can feel a little relieved that my long-cherished wish has finally come true, almost at the same time, another indescribable sadness has penetrated my body and mind: Will I be forced to burn them again...&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;It was late at night and the prison cell was silent. My place is very close to the big wall. I can see the high-voltage wires rustling in the wind on the high wall and the sentries on the watchtowers with guns and live ammunition...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Change of sentence and release&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Complete translation of &quot; Less than ten days after the 13th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;, my life faced another major change: the Inner Mongolia High Court decided to revoke my original sentence and change my sentence to eight years! This is the result of Comrade Xiaoping&#39;s second comeback and his proposal to rectify all walks of life based on Mao Zedong&#39;s &quot;Three Instructions.&quot; I was arrested and sentenced in 1967. Based on this calculation, I have already served 8 years in prison, so I decided to commute my sentence to 8 years. But they don&#39;t understand that my sentence has been reduced by one year. It would be more &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;accurate&quot; if my sentence was reduced to nine years. The day the sentence modification was issued was September 27, 1975. Just sit as much as you like. There was no talk of state compensation at that time, and I had nothing to say. The labor camp decided to release him and allowed me to take away all the translations of the 13th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/bed71ffd4f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;606&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/bed71ffd4f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260459&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The 3.4 million-word manuscript of the 13th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; was translated in prison and is now in the Jiujiang Museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I returned to my hometown of Jiujiang and lived with my mother. Soon I was hired as a temporary worker in a factory hospital &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(doctor)&lt;/span>;, earning 34.5 yuan per month. At this time, the 14th edition of &quot;He&quot; became available. I bought it back and used it to compare, update, and supplement the translation of the 13th edition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 1978, the Party Central Committee held the historic Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, which changed from &quot;class struggle as the key link&quot; to economic construction as the center. The central government issued Document No. 55, which &quot;removed&quot; right-wing elements across the country. Any wrong demarcations would be corrected and they would lose their job arrangements. I was placed in Jiujiang Second People&#39;s Hospital. However, corrections and vindication must be done by the original unit. So in 1980, I returned to my original workplace in Inner Mongolia. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Signed for publication&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The corrections by the rightists and the redress of injustices went smoothly, and there was an unexpected surprise: because my injustices were all during the catastrophe, according to regulations, all the wages that were deducted and fined at that time were It can be reissued, so I suddenly became a “10,000-yuan household”! This was a huge amount of money at the time. While I was waiting for the step-by-step approval, I went to the Inner Mongolia People&#39;s Publishing House to inquire about publishing matters for a friend&#39;s book manuscript. The editor who received me, Xu Cheng, is the deputy director in charge of the science and technology editorial office. Xu Cheng was not interested in his friend&#39;s manuscript and asked casually: Are there any other manuscripts? I also replied casually: &quot;Are you interested in the big manuscript? &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;.&quot; Unexpectedly, Xu Cheng&#39;s eyes lit up and he became more energetic. He asked me carefully about the manuscript and my situation, and asked me to give him some time. More than 20 days later, Xu Cheng came to me to sign a contract and said that they decided to publish it in 10 volumes one after another, all in three years! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Cheng’s words shocked me: Is this such a big decision for such a big book? We have never met each other, how can he trust me? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that he has done a lot of work around this book these days: he knew that I was a doctor and found out that I was famous in Inner Mongolia back then; he retrieved the book I translated in the early years from the library. I have carefully read the &quot;Instructions for Clinical Surgery&quot;; I also held two symposiums, one of which was specially held in Beijing to solicit the opinions of participating experts on the publication of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; and received unanimous affirmation and support. , then reported to the leader and asked me to sign a contract. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the more important reason should be: Reform and opening up, many wastes are waiting to be done, and people are eager to understand the outside world. However, after these years of hard work, English talents are rare and there are not many left. I finally It came to life, and there was this ready-made translation. This is my luck, in fact, it is also my fluke. Despite this, I still admire Xu Cheng&#39;s professionalism very much. He is 12 years younger than me and graduated from the Biology Department of Inner Mongolia University in 1966. From then on, he and I became lifelong friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/1499da72df.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;871&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/1499da72df.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260460&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Cheng (right in the picture) and I discussed the publication of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I returned to Jiujiang, I immediately sent the first translation of &quot;Volume 5&quot; on cardiovascular disease to Xu Cheng. At that time, printing was still the age of lead type. I chose to publish this volume first, not because I am a doctor in this profession, but because of Xu Cheng’s marketing considerations: there are many people suffering from cardiovascular disease, so it is easy to sell ;&quot;>;(It turned out to be true. The initial printing of 10,000 copies sold out two months later, and more copies were printed immediately)&lt;/span>;. But during the typesetting period, I received the 15th edition of &quot;His&quot;, and the content also changed a lot! The number of authors has increased to 277, the length of the book has also expanded to about 5 million words, and even the layout style is very different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is another severe test for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can take a relatively easy path: according to the contract requirements, I will send out the completed translation manuscripts one after another and finish the book in three years. This is not considered backward internationally. But after all, I did not publish books for the sake of publishing books, but pursued it as a career. If I cannot dedicate the latest and best version to readers, even if this book comes out, I will leave deep regrets. After a fierce inner struggle at night, I got up at dawn and wrote a letter to Xu Cheng. As soon as the letter was sent, I couldn&#39;t help but go to the telecommunications office to make a long-distance call to him, explain the whole story, and ask him to immediately notify the printing factory to stop printing and recover the translation. I decided to start from scratch and re-translate the entire 15th edition of the book, and promised to hand over the first 500,000-word translation of Volume 5 within three months. The 10 volumes of the book will be released in about three years! &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Retranslation of the 15th edition&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is my fifth translation of &quot;Hebrew&quot;, and I strive to fully realize my early wish. I know the difficulty and workload of re-translating the entire book, but I think no matter how difficult it is, it will be much more convenient than translating the book in the labor camp. In order to save time, I never took any holidays from now on, and I also gave up the habit of taking a lunch break that I had developed over the years. I get up early every morning, stay up late and work at my desk. In February 1982, the first volume 5 was published as scheduled. At the end of December 1984, the translation of the 15th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; was finally completed, totaling 4.7 million words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f1b522794.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1441&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f1b522794.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260461&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Days and nights of re-translating the 15th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 1985, all ten volumes were published.

The Ministry of Health decided to establish a &quot;Special Award for Medical Translation&quot;. In February 1987, Minister Cui Yueli awarded me the award at the Ministry of Health. My wife Zeng Hanying was also invited to attend the award ceremony because of her hard work in the translation and publishing process. This award is the only one so far.

During the Republic of China, the Chinese Medical Association organized a group of domestic experts to collectively translate and publish the seventh edition of &quot;His&quot;, but it was limited to internal medicine-related content, not the entire book, so the title &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; was used. The original book has extensive content, including various systems of clinical internal medicine, including surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, dermatology and venereal diseases, eyes, ears, nose and throat, as well as public health, medical statistics, clinical testing and radiological diagnosis, medical genetics and ethics, etc. Therefore, the original title of the book is &quot;&lt;em>;Cecil Textbook of Medicine&lt;/em>;&quot; &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;His Medical Textbook&quot;)&lt;/span>;. I translated the entire book, which is also the first complete translation in my country, but I also used the title left by my predecessors when translating it: &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese translation of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; came out and received widespread attention. This is not because I really did anything great, but the characteristics of that era: reform and opening up, people&#39;s hearts are exciting, and a drama, A movie or a novel can often cause a sensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/09ffc11e53.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/09ffc11e53.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260464&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Invited to attend the launch ceremony of the 15th edition of the Chinese translation of &quot;Historical&quot; in Beijing.

Buyers are still coming in an endless stream. An old man rode a bicycle from the suburbs early to buy books. He is an engineer and there is no one in his family who is studying medicine. When I signed it for him, I reminded him that this was not a popular science book, but he still insisted on buying it. Later, when I was working on the supplementary translation of the 17th and 18th editions of &quot;His&quot;, my leader actually decided that the translation manuscript would be serialized in a comprehensive medical journal first, and the translation would be published as soon as possible. GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The length of the publication has been increased for this purpose)&lt;/span>;.

These are unimaginable and difficult to understand now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a world famous medical book, &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; has been translated into many languages, including Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and Portuguese.

Medical insurance fund. Our bureau attaches great importance to it. Based on the data screening and analysis, on August 8, a provincial and municipal joint inspection team of more than 20 people was formed with the Wuhu Municipal Medical Insurance Bureau to station in the hospital to conduct an investigation on the hospital charges and medical insurance reimbursements during the period when the reporter’s father was hospitalized.

This money was supposed to be used to prepare me for big things. But there are very few people who are as miserable as Zhu Dan and have no friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Zhu Dan revealed when participating in a program that he was defrauded of all his savings by a friend many years ago. She was deceived by her friend into being a debt guarantor and wrote her name on a blank piece of paper. As a result, she was forced to use all her savings to pay off all her friend&#39;s debts. Even if he won the lawsuit, the matter would end in Zhu Dan&#39;s misfortune because his shameless friend declared &quot;bankruptcy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How much this money is, many people are concerned about this issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the parties did not disclose specific figures, it is impossible to confirm. But this is not important, because we only need to know that this amount of money is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. The important thing is that this incident happened while Zhu Dan and Yiwei Yiwei were in love, but Yiwei Yi chose to repay the debt with Zhu Dan. In the program, when Zhu Dan recounted this unbearable event in a calm tone with red eyes under the wind chimes, Yiwei Yiwei looked at her with a distressed and forgiving look, as if he were facing a child who had been wronged. This scene It’s very emotional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that many people have met people who do things without thinking, otherwise there would be so many &quot;easy to deceive people&quot; in the world. How stupid is Zhu Dan&#39;s hasty behavior? As one netizen said, your behavior as a human being should not be too outrageous, and you must have a basic bottom line. Zhu Dan&#39;s best friend sent her a piece of white paper, and she dared to sign it. It was difficult for a middle school student to do this. Even the judge couldn&#39;t help &quot;teaching&quot; Zhu Dan that he was legally illiterate. As long as he signed on the white paper, It is equivalent to admitting everything on this piece of paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen said that he does not have such a wife, but he has such a mother. These words also touched the sensitive parts of many people&#39;s hearts. I have relatives and friends who are like this. They don&#39;t listen to anything they say, and they only wake up after being deceived. However, it doesn&#39;t take long for them to fall into new routines again. As the saying goes, &quot;Dangdang is different&quot;, some people just can&#39;t get out of this tragic scam &quot;reincarnation&quot;. What can you do? Anyway, I heard that in addition to some parents &quot;paying the bill&quot; for their deceived children, there are many examples of couples breaking up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I very much agree with what this netizen said: Yiwei Yi helped her pay off the debt. This behavior cannot be described as high-spirited and upright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Yiwei Yi seems to be indifferent to Zhu Dan, which is one of the reasons why some &quot;black fans&quot; have been criticizing Yiwei. Not only do they feel that Yiwei is not good to Zhu Dan, but they also habitually show off in public places. The &quot;poker-faced&quot; Zhou Yiwei got a lot of insults on his head. There are even rumors that the two are getting married. But now, many netizens woke up from the misunderstanding and discovered that Yiwei Yiwei is so good - &quot;I apologize for talking about Yiwei before. If he can avoid divorce after such a thing, I respect him as a real man.&quot; &quot;We endure hardships and enjoy happiness together.&quot; &quot;There are not many people who can repay debts together. And it&#39;s a man, even less.&quot; &quot;I thought he was quite shrewd, and it seemed like he was in love. I thought this kind of thing could only be done by parents to their children.&quot; &quot;Come out&quot; &quot;Yiwei Zhou is a relatively aloof but loyal type&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You know, at that time Yiwei could have broken up with Zhu Dan without having to sacrifice himself. Even if the two are already married, Yiwei Yi has every reason to ignore the &quot;bad debt&quot;. After all, even according to the marriage law, it is not his responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Dan was tricked by his friends, which is a typical example of being defrauded. According to legal principles, whether you have an obligation to repay debts caused by being defrauded depends on whether the debts are used jointly by the husband and wife. Unless there is evidence to prove that the debt belongs to the couple&#39;s common living use, the other party has no obligation and responsibility to repay it. Obviously, the occurrence of Zhu Dan&#39;s debt had nothing to do with Zhou Wei, nor was it the result of a joint discussion between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s ridiculous is that one netizen even commented that Zhou Yiwei actually used this matter to manipulate Zhu Dan and gain a useful slave. This is illogical. What can you do if you have tens of millions in your hand? What can you buy and eat? Do you have to give up half your life savings to someone else? Those who say this, and those who believe this, can also pay 10 million or 20 million for someone to treat you as a &quot;master&quot; and see if you are willing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is really sad to see people without knowing their surroundings. We should feel lucky to still have such a kind and loving man like Yiwei Yi in our field of vision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because of the old saying that &quot;husband and wife are originally birds of the same forest, and they fly separately when disaster strikes&quot;, acts of friendship are particularly noble. If a couple wants to maintain a long-term relationship, it is not enough to have an emotional foundation. In a difficult and changing world, if there is a lack of moral support and a little noble personality from both parties, it is not surprising that the couple breaks up halfway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the personal point of view of the author, does not represent the position of our newspaper) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[阿童木会流泪吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261742]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/H4PoJ90PIQJmpKm7m3yKcQmBPcEXKYYenxj2YfGt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;648&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/H4PoJ90PIQJmpKm7m3yKcQmBPcEXKYYenxj2 YfGt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260022&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the recently launched animated series &quot;PLUTO&quot; by Netflix, the audience once again saw the familiar robot Astro Boy from their childhood. This animated work depicts the existential crisis of humans and robots after the Central Asian War. The information is dense, neat and compact, and its lightness is as impressive as its heaviness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hideo Kojima, the game producer and a well-known science fiction fan and animation fan, said, &quot;This work is completely different from robot animations and hero animations that can only fight. This is Japanese manga (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Comics&lt;/span>;), this is animation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The birth of ChatGPT made mankind realize that it may be replaced in the new technological environment Species crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict caused tragic casualties. In this reality, &quot;PLUTO&quot; appeared: the shadow of the post-war period shrouded the entire earth, and Persia, which had lost its country, created the giant robot Pluto and wanted to destroy him. Seven of the world&#39;s strongest robots, including Astro Boy. In the fictional story, &quot;war robot crisis&quot; replaces &quot;nuclear crisis&quot;, and &quot;robot sanctions&quot; replace &quot;nuclear sanctions&quot; in international politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1964, Japanese cartoonist Osamu Tezuka launched the special &quot;Astro Boy&quot; episode &quot;The Strongest Robot on Earth&quot;. From the 1950s to the 1970s when Japanese comics were on the rise, most cartoonists of Tezuka’s generation took a left-leaning political stance because of their experience in World War II. They were anti-war, respectful of life, and advocating equality in their works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, with the permission of Osamu Tezuka&#39;s son, cartoonist Naoki Urasawa created &quot;PLUTO&quot; based on &quot;The Strongest Robot on Earth&quot;. &quot;PLUTO&quot;, born in 2023, is an animated series created by Netflix on this basis. From the anti-war thoughts in 1964, to the Iraq War in 2003, to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in 2023, the three creations of &quot;PLUTO&quot; correspond to the war backgrounds of different eras. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has long allowed the world to accept the artistic language of comics. Tokiwa-so cartoonists headed by Osamu Tezuka have redefined the depth and breadth of comics. Their depiction and exploration of emotions have made their works Crossing the boundaries of the audience. Although &quot;PLUTO&quot; takes place in the context of a grand robot war, its setting is still classical: How can a robot become more like a human? On the one hand, humans are afraid of being replaced by machines; on the other hand, they are full of discrimination against androids - humans have emotions, and robots are just inferior species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Robot, are you really not sad? When robots cry, even they themselves are surprised. Who am I? Am I really grieving? Are these reactions emotions, or a set of codes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While watching this animation, I needed to press the pause button several times and stop for a while. Its perception and depiction of emotions are very innocent and beautiful, and sadness comes in an extremely light way. When Astro Boy is destroyed, will he be allowed to declare &quot;death&quot;? Or it can only be declared &quot;damaged and scrapped&quot;. Naoki Urasawa continues Tetsuka&#39;s exploration of &quot;the relationship between man and others&quot;, and still almost stubbornly depicts the possibility of &quot;understanding&quot; in a world full of fragmentation and disputes. For example, the robot North 2 went to the hometown of a stubborn artist to find the piano music in the artist&#39;s dream; the dinner between the robot Astro Boy and Dr. Pegasus; Ulan, who lost Astro Boy, could not face his own perception. The little robot keeps running around, trying to help sad humans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t seen such an animated work for a long time. The last time it gave me such an emotional experience was the animated film &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. Its English name is &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. Those whispers in the machine body may be just ghosts that are difficult to define, but it happened after all, didn&#39;t it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 13:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[母亲起诉儿子返还购房款：对家庭是一个警示丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261756]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 11:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to CCTV&#39;s &quot;Today&#39;s Statement&quot; report, Yang&#39;s mother is a single mother, and her original condom was located in Dongcheng District, Beijing. The only house I have is my only son, Xiao Yang. She got 3.7 million from selling her house and transferred it to her son. She used it to buy a larger house in Tongzhou District, which she lived in and used as a wedding house for her son. Only her son&#39;s name was written on the property ownership certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2019, Xiao Yang got married, and Yang’s mother lived with Xiao Yang and his wife in the new house. Soon after the marriage, the daughter-in-law had conflicts with Yang&#39;s mother over daily trivial matters. The relationship between Xiao Yang, who firmly stands by his wife, and Yang&#39;s mother continues to deteriorate. After that, Xiao Yang and his wife moved out of their new house. Later, because his wife had another quarrel with Yang&#39;s mother, Xiao Yang became angry and blocked Yang&#39;s mother on WeChat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, in order to solve the problem of her daughter’s schooling, Xiao Yang sent a WeChat message to her grandmother: “Sell the house in Tongzhou and let my mother use the money from her original sale to buy another house, and I will save money. Buy a house.&quot; &quot;If my mother can&#39;t agree, I will go to court to sue my mother in one month. If it really goes to court, there will be no turning back on our mother-son relationship.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Known After what her son said, Yang&#39;s mother said she was &quot;completely heartbroken&quot; and said she would be &quot;homeless&quot; if Xiao Yang sued her for obstruction. So Yang&#39;s mother sued Xiao Yang to return the purchase price of 3.7 million yuan for future pension purposes, and received the support of the court. This decision is in accordance with common law, or good customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a typical case of the conflict between the extended family orientation and the small family orientation. The current statutory legal framework talks about the individual standard and the small family standard: the division of property is based on the boundaries between individuals and small families, and small families implement the &quot;community property system&quot;; parents have raised their children to adulthood and have done their best to support them. Adult children have the obligation to support their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children who are minors must rely on their parents’ care, care and protection. Parents have custody and control over their children. When children become adults, they separate from their parents and form a nuclear family. If they get married and buy a house on their own, and do not receive support from their parents, nor do they expect to receive large amounts of property or inheritance from their parents, then the parents have not interfered with their children. A legitimate reason and effective starting point in life, children are &quot;independent&quot; from the extended family and gain the &quot;sovereignty&quot; of the small family. This is a normal intergenerational power transfer in a family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if on the one hand, the children get a large amount of support from their parents when they get married and buy a house, but on the other hand, they want to have a soft life and refuse their parents&#39; interference in their lives (whether it is &quot;suggestions&quot; or &quot;pointing fingers&quot;) Well, it’s actually the same thing), which essentially refuses parents to fulfill their “investor rights/powers”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as this case is concerned, the quarrel between the daughter-in-law and Yang&#39;s mother over &quot;daily trivial matters&quot; may have started because the daughter-in-law couldn&#39;t stand her mother-in-law&#39;s lifestyle, or she couldn&#39;t accept her mother-in-law&#39;s interference in the couple&#39;s lifestyle. The specific quarrel may have different rights and wrongs, but the underlying reason must be: the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are fighting for the right to speak or dominate the house or the family, or one party believes that the other party has usurped his rights to the things in the house or the family. power or dominance. This is the essence of many conflicts between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a lot of poisonous chicken soups on the Internet nowadays, such as &quot;A husband must stand for his daughter-in-law, otherwise he will be a mama&#39;s boy.&quot; This is probably because the daughter-in-law or the person who acts as the daughter-in-law by herself is online more, while the mother-in-law is less online, and the former has a higher voice. bigger. After Yang&#39;s mother paid 3.7 million yuan to provide a wedding house for the young couple, after the conflict between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, the son did not reconcile the conflict, but blindly sided with the daughter-in-law, further intensifying the conflict, which shows that the son has nothing to do with his mother, who is an elder and investor. respect. There are many voices on the Internet who ridicule Xiao Yang for &quot;taking a wife and forgetting her mother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, it was originally a tough and feasible plan to &quot;sell the house in Tongzhou and let my mother use the money from her original sale to buy another house while I save money to buy another house.&quot; But at the same time, Xiao Yang threatened his mother with &quot;prosecution&quot; and &quot;mother-child affection&quot;, which made her a little confused. During the court hearing, Yang&#39;s mother requested that the 3.7 million be recognized as a loan, while Xiao Yang requested that it be recognized as a gift from his mother, which seemed to contradict his promise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court ultimately determined that the money was a loan. But even if it is a gift, it is conditional and can be withdrawn. Mother Yang gave the money to her son to buy a house and only wrote his son&#39;s name on it. What she really meant was not &quot;I gave this money to you unconditionally. The house I bought will be written on your name.&quot; You can name it whatever you want.&quot; Instead, &quot;Mom, I have given all my belongings to prepare a wedding room for you. I will live with you. You have to take good care of me when I grow old. I only write your name because I hope you can compare my feelings with mine. Not only do they have the right to live, they should also be respected.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xiao Yangs not only failed to manage intergenerational conflicts and despised the rights/rights of investors, but instead took the initiative to escalate conflicts and regarded their widowed mother as an enemy. Such a move is morally wrong, and it is unfair to weigh the interests and benefits. Sensible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s okay to adhere to individual orientation + small family orientation, and at the same time insist on living independently and rejecting large-amount funding from parents; if you accept large-amount funding from parents, you must respect the rights/powers of the investor, and even You must have the awareness to be a low-key child. Of course, high-profile parents may not intervene, but in this case, not intervening is a sign of affection, not a duty. &quot;Having both&quot; doesn&#39;t work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, this case is also a warning to parents. By raising the children to adulthood, the parents&#39; duty has been completed and the legal responsibilities have been fulfilled. You cannot hand over your old capital to your children casually, and your main assets must be in your own hands. If a child needs a large amount of financial aid, it can be lent in a clear way, stipulating the principal, interest and repayment plan, or at least it should be clear that the parents have the right to claim it back. Don&#39;t let the children feel that their parents&#39; love for them is unconditional and they can take whatever they want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parent-child love must be two-way. It is sad that many parents become the tools of their children, providing money and effort, and then being picked on and stabbed by their young couples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
