Picture from &quot;The Munger Way&quot; &quot;A book by Hong Hai.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/01/b5db27ea16.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/01/b5db27ea16.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260319&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 2023, Munger was at his home in Los Angeles. The picture is from the book &quot;The Munger Way&quot;, photographed by Hong Hai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Charlie Munger was 99 years old. When the news came that he passed away in California, USA on November 28, 2023, people were not particularly surprised, but this will not reduce people’s memory of him. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Warren Buffett commented in the statement, &quot;Without Charlie&#39;s inspiration, wisdom and involvement, Berkshire Hathaway would not be able to reach its current position.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Charlie Munger is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and the most important partner of Warren Buffett for half a century. Their investment company has written a wealth myth-from 1965 to 2022, the compound annual rate of return is as high as 19.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But his departure will not have much impact on Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway has confirmed that 61-year-old Vice Chairman Greg Abel will succeed Buffett as CEO, and Buffett will become non-executive chairman. Day-to-day operations will be handled by Abel and Vice Chairman Geet Jain. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;When people miss Munger, what exactly are they missing? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since November 28, many tributes to Charlie Munger have appeared on Chinese social media. Many people mentioned each other&#39;s &quot;last face&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duan Yongping, known as &quot;China&#39;s Buffett&quot;, posted on social media about &quot;the dinner we had at the same table after the shareholders&#39; meeting on April 30 last year.&quot; Ten billion private equity investor Lin Yuan recalled, &quot;I had a communication with Munger in 2018, which lasted about half an hour.&quot; Luo Jiaming, the fund manager of China Europe Fund, said, &quot;I never imagined that the first time I saw Charlie in Omaha this year would be the last time in my life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actress Tian Pujun posted a photo with Munger for the second time, writing, &quot;Last month, I planned with my friends to go to LA (Los Angeles) to celebrate your 100th birthday in January. Forever.&quot; I miss that beautiful evening half a year ago...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger has always maintained close contacts with the Chinese investment community and is a staunch supporter of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months before his death, on October 30, Munger also said when recording the well-known American technology investment podcast &quot;Acquired&quot; that &quot;the prospects of China&#39;s economy in the next 20 years will be greater than that of almost any other large economy.&quot; Everyone needs to be in good health.” Munger is also optimistic about China&#39;s leading companies. Regarding the so-called &quot;China risk theory&quot; from the outside world, he bluntly said that he is &quot;willing to bear it&quot; and &quot;doesn&#39;t mind&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the Chinese companies that Charlie Munger has invested in, BYD is the only company to publicly express its condolences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;BYD&#39;s official Weibo wrote, &quot;We have sadly lost a mentor and friend.&quot; It commented that Munger is one of the greatest investors of our time and has set an immortal benchmark for the investment community. &quot;In 2008, we were fortunate to receive his recognition, and Berkshire Hathaway became an important shareholder of the company. This is the first time that the company has been recognized by a top international investment institution, which has injected strong confidence into our commitment to the new energy vehicle industry. and motivation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to BYD, another Chinese company Charlie Munger holds is Alibaba. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of the third quarter of this year, Charlie Munger held 300,000 shares of Alibaba through the independently held &quot;Daily Journal&quot; company, with a market value of US$26.022 million, accounting for approximately 16.5% of the investment portfolio. &quot;Daily Journal&quot; holds a total of four stocks, and Alibaba is the only Chinese concept stock. However, Southern Weekend reporters checked Alibaba’s Weibo, WeChat public accounts and official website, and found no mention of Munger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in February 2023, Munger said frankly, &quot;I think investing in Alibaba was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. I was fascinated by its leading position in China&#39;s Internet industry. But not realizing it&#39;s still a retailer, it&#39;s a competitive business...I overestimated Alibaba&#39;s future returns.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Is value investing suitable for A-shares?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Value investing is the core value of Charlie Munger and Buffett. Munger&#39;s departure has once again sparked a discussion in the investment circle about whether value investing is suitable for A-shares. Many netizens have taken stock of A-share stocks that are known as value investments but have poor performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yuan, managing director of ZhenFund, said on social media, “In China, Munger exists not more as an investor, but as a conceptual thinker. His principles are not applicable to A-shares. It must be applicable, but the universal wisdom of life has inspired many people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Delong, executive general manager of Qianhai Kaiyuan Fund, is a firm supporter of value investment theory. When mourning Munger, he once again expressed his belief in value investment to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Value investment is a common theory. The investment philosophy of the world is not only suitable for the U.S. stock market, but also for the A-share market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, the current doubts about value investment are &quot;blind men touching the elephant&quot;, and &quot;the elephant must be seen from a distance&quot; Only in this way can we see, and we cannot generalize.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes, “In the past three years, the overall economy has been in decline, and the stock market has also experienced a bear market. If we only take this cross-section, it seems that value investors are also losing money, and they are no different from others. If we take 10 years, On a 20-year scale, the targets of value investment have increased many times.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also admitted that the Chinese market has its own characteristics. &quot;The value investment theory with Chinese characteristics means that we must not only adhere to Buffett&#39;s value investment theory, but also combine the ups and downs of the A-share market to make some appropriate positions.&quot; manage&quot;. When there is a bubble in the stock price, you dare to reduce or even short positions; when the stock price is undervalued, you dare to take advantage of dips. Controlling drawdowns through position management may be more suitable for the A-share market in the long run. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people attribute the failure of value investing in China to insufficient implementation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Zhang Ying, founding managing partner of Matrix Partners, felt, &quot;Looking through the circle of friends at the moment, I feel that 90% of the people are loyal followers of Mr. Munger.&quot; But what most people achieve in their own fields or personal investments is &quot;mediocre performance, and many even fail to achieve a positive cycle, and quite the opposite.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his opinion, the reason is very simple. Most people understand the underlying logic and core principles of Buffett and Munger at most literally. &quot;The possibility of persisting in doing it for a long time is almost zero.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Southern Weekend reporters found that when talking about Munger, more people would forward his philosophy of life and evaluate him as a wise man or a winner in life than when discussing investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Wang Huan, chairman of Zige Investment, said, he represents the highest standards for investors: &quot;Wisdom, humor, humility, longevity, happiness, children and grandchildren...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dan Bin, a well-known private equity fund manager and chairman of Shenzhen Oriental Harbor Investment Management Co., Ltd., has reposted many condolence articles in WeChat Moments. He borrowed words from &quot;Banshan Collected Works&quot; to describe Munger, &quot;People have to be shocked by prosperity and moved by simplicity. The distance between these two experiences measures the width of a life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;This is the guy I like&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the late 1970s, Charlie Munger became the number two man at Berkshire Hathaway, and since then Warren Buffett has become his name Fixed collocations before: &quot;Buffett&#39;s business partner&quot;, &quot;Buffett&#39;s closest friend&quot;, &quot;Buffett&#39;s most capable assistant&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Bloomberg, and Reuters, the most influential media in the world, all reported the death of Charlie Munger without exception. Put Buffett in the title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buffett is always the protagonist in the crowd, and &quot;Don&#39;t be jealous&quot; is one of Charlie&#39;s life advices. &quot;Jealousy is a very stupid sin, because it is the only one you can never get from.&quot; The Sin of Having Fun.” Forbes values ​​Munger&#39;s wealth at $2.6 billion, while Buffett&#39;s wealth exceeds $100 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I don’t mind playing second fiddle to Warren at all,” Charlie Munger said in an interview with the New York Times. “Normally, wherever I go, I dominate. But I&#39;m willing to play second fiddle when other people are better. It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve rarely been in that position, except with Warren.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They may be the most memorable in the history of human investing. A golden pair. The seeds of this were laid when Munger was still a child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Charlie Munger, who was born in 1924, experienced the economic crisis as a child and had to work in Buffett&#39;s grandfather&#39;s grocery store, earning 20 cents an hour. But it wasn&#39;t until 1959 that the two really met, and it can be said that they &quot;hit it off&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buffett later recalled, &quot;He was rolling on the floor laughing, and I thought, &#39;This is the person I like,&#39; and I did the same thing.&quot; The same was true for Munger. His wife once asked him, &quot;You Why are you paying so much attention to him?&quot; Munger replied, &quot;You don&#39;t understand, that&#39;s not an ordinary person.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The friendship between the two continues to this day. The iconic scene of this tacit understanding is that at the shareholders&#39; meeting, Munger always responded with a deadpan expression, &quot;I have nothing to add.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger deliberately gave the stage to Buffett, who is actually very talkative. The Wall Street Journal reported that he would speak for hours at the annual meeting of the Daily Journal, a small media company where he serves as chairman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If he paused to take a sip of water while someone else began to speak, Munger would haughtily raise his index finger to prevent the other speaker from interjecting before he could swallow the water in his mouth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, he is also a famous &quot;master of golden sentences.&quot; Whether on Weibo, Twitter or Facebook, his wise words can be seen everywhere. Buffett never published a book, but Charlie Munger left many writings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buffett said in 1988, &quot;I was hugely influenced by Charlie. God, I would be a lot poorer if I just listened to Benjamin Graham.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mang Gerard&#39;s biggest influence on Buffett was to stop him from picking up the &quot;butt of cigars.&quot; Both regard Benjamin Graham as a mentor, but the difference is that Buffett will buy any business, even if it is dying, as long as the price is low. Berkshire Hathaway was once a textile factory on the verge of bankruptcy, also known as the legendary &quot;butt of cigars.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger spent many years persuading Buffett to focus more on excellent companies with acceptable prices. The income generated by these companies in the future will far exceed the premium paid today. The most famous example is See&#39;s Candies, a business originally sold for $25 million that brought Buffett and Munger nearly $1 billion in after-tax profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 21, 2023, just a week before Munger&#39;s death, Buffett donated approximately US$870 million worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares to four family charities. He also issued a rare letter to shareholders, recommitting that more than 99% of his wealth will be donated to charity, and his children will be the executors of his will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also stated in the letter, &quot;I am 93 years old and feel very good, but I am fully aware that I am playing overtime.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt; br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt; /a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 12:25:12 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[雪山脚下的高原第一镇]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261653]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/no0ytFNX3YjL4Zhy9pNOsJBeiQLmFi30Rl6LgaZ2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/no0ytFNX3YjL4Zhy9pNOsJBeiQLmFi30R l6LgaZ2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260023&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the evening, residents of Parry Town came for a walk on the hillside&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It took a day&#39;s bus ride from Shigatse to Yadong County on the border of southern Tibet. The scenery I experienced on the road was ever-changing. It was both Tibet and Inner Mongolia. Finally, like Yunnan, Yadong County is known as &quot;Tibet&#39;s Little Jiangnan&quot;. Yadong County is located at the junction of China, India, and Bhutan. It is located at the southern foot of the middle section of the Himalayas. It is only 2,700 meters above sea level. The air is humid and the vegetation is very lush. The deeper you go, the more you feel like you are in a virgin forest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yadong&quot; in Tibetan means &quot;whirlpool&quot; or &quot;deep valley of rapids&quot;. As its name suggests, Yadong County is located in a ravine, and the Yadong River surges along the county. As a border county, Yadong used to be a trade channel between China and India. I wanted to visit the border during this trip, and Yadong, with its unique location, became my first choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When traveling to Yadong, you must take the government’s tourist bus.” Before departure, the owner of the B&amp;B in Shigatse reminded me this, which made me, who is used to traveling independently, even more curious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/XdzvjF4pyO0UTZkhW2UYQN25VIJedB4W5BVV606I.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/XdzvjF4pyO0UTZkhW2UYQN25VIJedB4W5BVV606I.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260021&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dromulari Snow Mountain near Pali Town&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Arrived at the local area, the mystery is gradually revealed. In May this year, the local government wanted to develop tourism and opened a tourist line to take tourists to Nathula National Gate and other scenic spots for free. Visitors only need to reserve seats in advance and purchase travel insurance of 1.5 yuan at their own expense. I added the staff on WeChat, sent my ID number and name, made an appointment for the next day’s trip, and purchased insurance at the hotel’s service desk. In Yadong, every hotel will provide government tour buses and purchase insurance information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, I set out for the bus boarding point. The county town is very small, and it takes less than half an hour to walk around. All four tourist buses were full, and each bus had a local tour guide. Our tour guide was a young Tibetan man with a cheerful personality. I learned in the subsequent chat that he is a local. He finished college in Lhasa, served as a soldier for two years, and is now back as a tour guide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first stop is Nathu La National Gate located at the junction of China and India. The tourist bus drove for more than half an hour, spiraling along the mountain road and arriving at an altitude of 4,300 meters. Nathu La Port is the highest road trade channel in the world. Currently, only government sightseeing vehicles can drive to the Nathu La National Gate, and private vehicles are prohibited from passing through. Taking pictures is also not allowed. The tour guide took away our mobile phones and ID cards for centralized management. After getting off the bus, tourists lined up in front of the country gate, and the tour guide took photos of everyone with their mobile phones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/uPXYTeAtbeud0Qnzz4iRYPq9eo48XohRTmniPiBG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/uPXYTeAtbeud0Qnzz4iRYPq9eo48XohRTmniPiBG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260024&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The old Tibetan man herding cattle introduced me to the history of Pali Town&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t want to queue, so I walked into the &quot;International Mail Center&quot; near the country gate. This is an observatory where you can watch India on the opposite side. As I climbed up to the second floor, I saw some tourists who were panting and unable to walk, and some were holding oxygen tanks and breathing oxygen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standing on the second floor, you can see the Indian National Gate opposite, which is less than 20 meters away. Several Indian soldiers are patrolling, and the surrounding bare mountains are dotted with Chinese and Indian bunkers. The young soldiers stationed in Nathu La told us that in July the mountains here are covered with thick white snow and red azaleas. He also said that tourists from India also come for sightseeing every day. They usually show up around 1 p.m. and stand on the observation deck opposite to watch China. At this time, a wild horse and a wild dog came down from the mountain opposite, causing people to make a noise. &quot;Is this from China or India?&quot; someone asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I would not be able to reach these places by myself without a car. Tibet has huge mountains, and the sightseeing tour ended at 4 pm. The car spent two-thirds of the time traveling through the mountains. In addition to the Nathu La National Gate, we also visited the Kagyu Monastery, the border well-off village, Linhai Waterfall, etc. until we arrived. The end of the border between China, India and Bhutan. Along the way, the Yadong River also followed us, rushing forward along the road, and finally disappeared at the border of the three countries, entering India and Bhutan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the few days I arrived, roads were being built everywhere in Yadong County, and the roadbeds in front and behind the hotel were dug up. I didn’t stay long and decided to go to Pali Town, which is under the jurisdiction of the county. Compared with Yadong County, Pali Town makes me yearn for it more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pali Town is known as the &quot;highest town in the world&quot;, and &quot;Pali&quot; means &quot;rotating mountains&quot; in Tibetan. It was once an important trading town in Tibet. When Yadong County was still a small village, the streets of Pali Town were already filled with caravan merchants and Khampa people from India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Hundreds of years ago, escaped serfs, missionary believers, and traders came to Pali grassland to seek life. Immigration drove the development of Pali. When the Yadong Port was closed in the 1960s (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Editor&#39;s note: it was reopened many years later with the improvement of Sino-Indian relations&lt;/span>;), commercial activities began decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nzbnjAjoWOUn4OY2jnzLV7BM597aPDz2hG7c5y9n.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nzbnjAjoWOUn4OY2jnzLV7BM597aPDz2hG7c5y9n.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260025&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The remaining wall of the old house in Parry Town&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Pali Town is only an hour&#39;s drive from Yadong County, but it is more than 4,300 meters above sea level and has a completely different climate from Yadong County. Pali Town is located in the vast Pali grassland. Not far away is the beautiful Zhuomulari Snow Mountain, so close that you can reach out and touch it. Around the highway, two-story residential buildings are neatly arranged. During the season when I arrived, golden rapeseed flowers and green grasslands spread out in layers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People who come to Pali Town are usually tourists passing through Yadong County. As soon as I got off the car, I was attracted by this quiet town. Walking through the small alleys, you can appreciate the strong atmosphere of life, Tibetan-style buildings built of stone, neatly placed cow dung on the courtyard walls, and bright window frames painted in red, green and blue. It only takes ten minutes to walk from the town to the grassland, and you will meet almost no people. You can only see a sheep herder and a man drying cow dung in the distance. There are only three hotels in the town, all run by Tibetans. Most of the rooms have no bathrooms. I chose the cheapest single room, and I could directly see the snow-capped mountains from the room window. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, most of the houses in Pali Town are newly built. I only encountered an old dilapidated house on the slope behind the town. The house was overgrown with weeds and half of the wall collapsed. A local old man saw that I was very interested in old houses and showed me old photos on his mobile phone. He also took me to visit several old houses. One of them had &quot;1958&quot; vaguely engraved on the old stone wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“大气”成为评测的关键词？消费者购车不能只看颜值]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261530]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On social media, some people questioned the interior layout design of a certain brand of new car because the platform in front of the co-pilot It is designed as a storage table. However, the concept of vehicle safety has always been that other items cannot be placed on the center console because the airbag is underneath. Sufficient space must be left for the airbag to explode in the event of a traffic accident, otherwise it will cause damage to the vehicle. Secondary injury to personnel inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are many such designs for electric vehicles. For example, car door handles must be highly reliable and can be opened under any circumstances. Mechanical ones are best, but now many cars use built-in door handles, and even electric ones. Once the car enters water, it loses power. , the car door cannot be opened from the outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This phenomenon of over-innovation, or neglecting safety for the sake of innovation, is to some extent because China’s automobile consumer market is not mature enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Car consumption requires certain professional knowledge. Cars are the crystallization of human technology and engineering. Each car has many parts that are precisely integrated together, and its operation involves a lot of professional knowledge. Every system and every component of the car has its specific function and role. The engine outputs power, which determines the power and performance of the car; the chassis is the skeleton of the car, which determines the car&#39;s handling and comfort; and the braking system, fuel system, cooling system, etc. ensure the normal operation of the car. These systems and components are interrelated and cooperate with each other to allow the car to operate normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industrial products have various parameters and technical characteristics. Cars are almost the most parameter-based things that ordinary people have access to. Understanding these parameters and performance can help consumers choose a car that suits them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parameters such as engine capacity, power, torque, fuel consumption, suspension type, braking performance, tire specifications, etc., all directly affect the driving experience and driving safety. For ordinary consumers, if they want to buy a car that suits them, they need to learn and master certain professional knowledge, such as understanding the difference between three-link and five-link, which one is safer, disc brake or drum brake, electric vehicle There are also differences between lithium iron phosphate and ternary lithium batteries. This requires constant online searching and reading, which is too difficult a task for most people. On the one hand, this requires a certain cultural level to digest this knowledge; on the other hand, it requires a lot of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a lot of technical arguments under various car review videos on the Internet, but to some extent this is just an illusion. It is just people who understand technology gather under specific videos. Most people do not know how to do it. Get involved in this debate. They will say that such-and-such car has been reduced in price again, who will buy such a car, but they do not know that most Chinese consumers will not care about this at all. They are a minority among consumers and are not important to manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When consumers do not understand the technical parameters, manufacturers can attract consumers through things they can understand and guide them to see what to see or ignore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In today&#39;s automobile market, many consumers tend to focus on the appearance, interior and intelligent systems of the car when buying a car, while ignoring the basic functions of the car, that is, the Ride, safety and handling performance. This phenomenon reflects to some extent modern people’s expectations and values ​​for cars, and also reveals certain problems in the automotive industry’s ability to meet consumer needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers are understandably concerned about the exterior and interior of their cars. China has just entered the era of automobile popularization. Cars are still very expensive and still have a strong identity function. Therefore, the appearance and interior design of cars have an important impact on consumers&#39; purchasing decisions. Chinese consumers often like to use the word &quot;daqi&quot; when evaluating cars, so that foreign car designers all know the word &quot;daqi&quot;. Without translation, they can understand a series of connotations it represents: majestic, huge, solemn, Have a face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When consumers like it, manufacturers will naturally make the interior and exterior of the car more luxurious. At the same time, the current development of information technology has indeed continuously improved the information technology content of cars. Automobile manufacturers are also constantly introducing various innovative design elements to meet consumers&#39; needs for freshness and personalization. This kind of innovation even reaches the level of innovation for the sake of innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, consumers are often confused by the gorgeous appearance and advanced technology of the vehicle. They pay too much attention to the appearance, interior and intelligent systems of the car, and are attracted by the big sofa and big screen, but ignore it. The core values ​​of a car: performance in driving, safety and handling, which are directly related to consumers’ driving experience and driving safety. The total cost of a car is limited. If the cost is spent on visible places, you will naturally save money on invisible places. Since consumers don&#39;t pay attention to it, manufacturers will save money in this aspect and turn to making their cars more flashy, but in the end they will bury various hidden dangers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, when consumers buy a car, they should learn some professional knowledge and consider more comprehensively the weight between the car&#39;s functions, performance, appearance, and interior. They should not just focus on the appearance, interior, and intelligent systems. aspects and ignore the basic functions of the car. At the same time, automobile manufacturers also have the obligation to guide consumers correctly. While meeting consumer needs, we also guide consumers to choose a car that suits them more rationally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public opinion competition among manufacturers is an important way for consumers to become more professional. Competitors are all professionals and understand the unspoken rules and various shady secrets in the industry. Therefore, supervision from within the industry is often more targeted at the crux of the problem. This kind of industry supervision has spread from the technical level to the communication level, and the most important way to let consumers know is through advertising and marketing. Regardless of the rights and wrongs involved, discussing technical issues in public opinion is itself a process of popularizing science and a way to encourage consumers to learn professional knowledge and gradually distinguish the rights and wrongs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[假身份、假公章、假协议，吴秀波踩入了多深的坑？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261657]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Stills of &quot;The Great Military Advisor Sima Yi&quot;.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/96f07b79ac.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;691&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/11/30/96f07b79ac.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260297&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from &quot;Army Division Sima Yi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 24, 2023, the news that &quot;Wu Xiubo and his company were expropriated for 466 million yuan&quot; became a hot search topic, and actor Wu Xiubo, who had been out of the spotlight for three years, returned to the public eye again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qichacha shows that Wu Xiubo and his 99%-owned Horgos Fuji Culture Media Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Fuji Company) have previously added a piece of information to be executed, and the execution target is 4.66 More than 100 million yuan, the execution party is the Higher People&#39;s Court of Jiangsu Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, Wu Xiubo posted two short videos on his personal Weibo, and the next day forwarded a long post on the official Weibo of the TV series &quot;Tiger Roars and Dragons Roar&quot;, detailing the TV series &quot;Army Master Sima Yi&quot; There were disputes during the production process, and it was said that &quot;two scammers with a lot of cases behind them used fake seals and contracts to set up a situation and caused bankruptcy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xiubo, 55, was once a late bloomer in the film and television industry. He once said that he had done many businesses after graduating from the Central Academy of Drama, including opening karaoke bars, restaurants, and making film and television soundtracks. It wasn&#39;t until the TV series &quot;Before Dawn&quot; was aired in 2010 that Wu Xiubo got his first taste of popularity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xiubo is obviously not satisfied with simply being an actor. After becoming famous, he frequently participated in the production and distribution of film and television dramas, and &quot;Army Master Sima Yi&quot; is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The drama is divided into two parts. The first part, &quot;Military Advisor Alliance&quot;, was broadcast on Jiangsu Satellite TV, Anhui Satellite TV, and Youku Video in June 2017, and achieved great success. With over 6 billion views and a Douban score of 8.2, it was one of the hottest dramas in 2017 and won the Feitian Award for Outstanding TV Drama that year. &quot;Tiger Roars and Dragon Roar&quot; is the second part. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, due to disputes over the distribution of interests, the three investors of the film launched a series of civil lawsuits against each other and were also involved in a criminal case. Another listed company suffered a decline in performance and was eventually delisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What kind of &quot;confusion&quot; is behind the popular TV series? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Key people hold decision-making positions in three companies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In October 2017, the popularity of the first part of &quot;Army Master Sima Yi&quot; has not subsided. The investor of the film, Jiangsu Huali Culture Media Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Huali Company) took another investor Dongyang Mengjiangwei Film and Television Culture Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Mengjiangwei Company) to court on the grounds that it failed to distribute income as agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case was heard in public at the Hanjiang People’s Court of Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province on June 11, 2018, and the employer-employee dispute has since surfaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fuer Company once stated in a statement that in 2013, company shareholder Wu Xiubo suggested the &quot;Sima Yi&quot; theme to Zhang Jian, then deputy general manager of Huali Company, and introduced Mengjiangwei Company Participate in project investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That year, Wu Xiubo was filming &quot;Ma Xiangyang Goes to the Countryside&quot; directed by Zhang Yongxin. Zhang Yongxin once recalled in an exclusive interview that at that time Wu Xiubo was trying to find a director for the Sima Yi-themed TV series he was planning to shoot. The two were both history buffs. Their similar historical outlook and aesthetic taste made Wu Xiubo throw an &quot;hydrangea ball&quot; to Zhang Yongxin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the referee document, on July 27, 2014, Huali Company and Zhang Yongxin signed a director employment contract, Huali Company affixed the company’s administrative seal, and Zhang Jian signed as the company representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly 20 days ago, Huali Company also signed the well-known screenwriter Zheng Wanlong to write the script of &quot;Army Master Sima Yi&quot;. The latter has participated in the scriptwriting of &quot;Iron Teeth and Bronze Teeth Ji Xiaolan&quot; and other dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huali Company is a newbie in the film and television industry, and the boss behind it is mainly engaged in real estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qichacha shows that Jin Hongxing, the actual controller of Huali Company, holds 42.38% of the shares of Jiangsu Huali Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. and once served as the latter’s executive director and general manager. The group was established in 2000 and is a long-established real estate company in Yangzhou. It has many projects in the local area and has won the title of &quot;Outstanding Real Estate Enterprise in Yangzhou City&quot; for five consecutive years from 2006 to 2010. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, another investor brought by Wu Xiubo, Mengjiangwei Company, has rich experience. The latter has participated in the production of popular dramas such as &quot;The New Four&quot; and &quot;Jingzhong Yue Fei&quot;. In April 2014, Mengjiangwei Company was acquired by the listed company Contemporary Oriental (delisted) for 1.1 billion yuan, a premium of 12 times. Contemporary Oriental made a fixed increase of 1.998 billion yuan for this purpose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 14, 2015, Huali Company and Mengjiangwei Company signed a joint investment contract, which mainly agreed that the former would be the producer of the series, and the latter would be exclusively responsible for the global distribution of the series, with a total investment of 150 million. Yuan, each party invests 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day, Huali Company signed an agreement with Fuji Company, entrusting the latter to film and produce the play. Huali Company was only responsible for investment, and both parties jointly appointed Zhang Jian as the producer of the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Fuji Company was established less than three months ago. Wu Xiubo, the actual controller, held 99% of the shares, and Zhang Jian served as the legal representative of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Zhang Jian plays three roles in this drama project. He is the deputy general manager of the drama&#39;s management, the legal representative of the production company, and the producer of the film and television project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the increase in cast and crew remuneration, the budget of the play has increased to 220 million yuan. Huali Company and Mengjiangwei Company signed a supplementary agreement a month later, each investing a further 35 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2016, the filming of &quot;Sima Yi&quot;, which had been in preparation for nearly three years, finally started in Hengdian. During the period, the broadcast platforms Jiangsu Radio and Television and Youku were also locked in advance, and Mengjiangwei Company was responsible for distribution matters according to the agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mengjiangwei Company first sold the series to Jiangsu Radio and Television Group for a total price of 200.8 million yuan and broadcast it within the agreed period. Youku also later paid 108 million yuan to Mengjiangwei Company for the online issuance of &quot;Military Division Alliance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of September 2017, more than two months after &quot;Military Alliance&quot; had finished airing, Huali Company sent a reminder letter to Mengjiangwei Company and its parent company, Contemporary Oriental, demanding proceeds from the issuance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Forged official seal and mutual non-recognition agreement&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mengjiangwei Company seems to be confused by Huali Company’s request. The former said that both parties and Fuji Company also signed a &quot;Supplementary Agreement&quot; II&quot; and &quot;Supplementary Agreement III&quot;, renegotiating the revenue sharing method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above two agreements, the budget of the film has been increased to 360 million yuan, and neither Huali Company nor Mengjiangwei Company will make additional investment. Huali Company discounted the cost of its script for 5% of the investment budget, and transferred the remaining 45% of the investment rights and corresponding rights to Fuji Company. At that time, Mengjiangwei Company had received an investment of 100.25 million yuan, so it also transferred the unpaid investment rights and corresponding rights and interests to Fuji Company. Jiangsu Radio and Television&#39;s distribution income goes to Mengjiangwei Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xiubo also expressed his approval of these two agreements. However, these agreements only bear the contract seals of the three companies. The column for Huali Company’s signature representative is blank. Zhang Jian signed the third supplementary agreement as a representative of Fuji Company. The signing date is only printed. &quot;2016&quot;, the specific month and day are also blank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fuer Company also provided a copy of the agreement between Huali Company and Horgos Premiere Times Film and Television Culture Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Premiere Times), stating that Huali Company will 5% of the investment share was sold to Premiere Times at a price of 20 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above agreement, Huali Company will no longer have the investment rights and corresponding rights and interests in the film. However, Huali Company not only did not recognize the above-mentioned agreement, but also issued two contracts with contradictory contents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 5th and 6th, 2017, Horgos Huali Company, a subsidiary of Huali Company, and Fuji Company signed the &quot;Global Exclusive Agency Distribution Agreement for TV Series&quot; and &quot;TV Series Information Network Dissemination Agreement&quot; &quot;Agency Distribution Agreement&quot; mainly stipulates that all the distribution income of the drama series will go into the account of Fuji Company, and then be divided in half by Fuji Company and Huali Company. The distribution income of the co-investor Mengjiangwei Company will be handled by Fuji Company. Jin Hongxing represented Huali Company, and Zhang Jian signed the contract on behalf of Fuji Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just a few days ago, on May 31, 2017, Fuji Company just signed a contract with Youku. The former granted the rights to network dissemination of the drama’s information and its sublicensing rights to the latter. The total price was tentatively determined. is 600 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Jin Hongxing also alleged that in the two supplementary agreements proposed by Mengjiangwei Company, the seals of Huali Company were forged by others, which involved another criminal case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One month after Huali Company sued Mengjiangwei Company, on November 8, 2017, the Yili Prefecture Public Security Bureau decided to investigate Zhang Jian on suspicion of official embezzlement and misappropriation of funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jian stated in the interrogation transcript that his appointment as the legal representative of Fuji Company was approved by Jin Hongxing. The two supplementary agreements mentioned above and the agreement with Premiere Times contained the special contract seal of Huali Company. , also carved under the instruction of Jin Hongxing. Jin Hongxing denied this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jian’s criminal verdict showed that Zhang Jian illegally took 21.768 million yuan of Fuji Company’s property as his own. The amount was huge, constituting the crime of job embezzlement, and he was sentenced to seven years in prison until June 2025. Ending on 2nd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court also found that although Huali Company signed a memorandum with Zhang Jian in April 2014, stating that it would establish a Beijing branch of Huali Company and hire Zhang Jian as the general manager of the company, Huali Company The Beijing branch has not been registered yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that Zhang Jian, who was deeply involved in the entire production process of the show and was regarded by Wu Xiubo and Mengwei Company as the representative of Huali Company, has never actually obtained legal status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Zhang Jian&#39;s identity, only his criminal verdict states that he was &quot;born in Linkou County, Heilongjiang Province on August 10, 1968.&quot; How he is involved in this huge TV series is still unknown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the lawsuit brought by Huali Company against Mengjiangwei, the Yangzhou Intermediate People&#39;s Court upheld the original judgment at the second instance and supported Huali Company&#39;s claim for 50% of the issuance income. Since then, Huali Company, Mengjiangwei Company and Wu Xiubo-controlled Fujian Company have launched multiple serial lawsuits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A long post on Weibo forwarded by Wu Xiubo stated that Horgos Huali Company’s case against Fuji Company was brought to the Jiangsu Provincial High Court. The latter lost the case and had to pay 50% of the issuance income to the former. And a liquidated damages of four times the bank interest rate, totaling about 500 million yuan. In November 2023, the Supreme People&#39;s Court made a ruling upholding the Jiangsu High Court&#39;s judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fuer Company has repeatedly raised jurisdictional objections in its related cases with Mengjiangwei Company, Huali Company and Horgos Huali Company, hoping that the cases would be heard by the courts in Beijing , however they failed to achieve success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of 2016, before &quot;Sima Yi, the Great Military Advisor&quot; was completed, legal cases began to break out intensively in the two real estate companies held by Jin Hongxing. According to Qichacha, Jiangsu Huali Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. is currently carrying 137 judicial cases, with a total execution amount of approximately 352 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 2021, several property market self-media posts in Yangzhou stated that the delivery of the Yangzhou Zhigu Huafu project had been delayed for several years, the owners were unable to apply for real estate certificates, and the Canal Villa project was suspected of being suspended and unfinished. Both properties are developed by Huali Real Estate Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Ali auction information, on November 17, 2020, a 92.72-square-meter residence in Yangzhou Shangri-La Manor was successfully traded for 1.76 million yuan. The owner is Jin Hongxing, the major shareholder of the developer Huali Real Estate Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qichacha shows that Jin Hongxing is currently &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; restricted from high consumption and is subject to execution. &lt;/span>; The total amount of execution is about 209.6 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Affected listed companies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When it acquired Mengjiangwei Company in 2014, Contemporary Oriental not only increased its working capital by 500 million yuan, but also attracted many celebrity investors to participate in the decision-making process. Zeng, Wu Xiubo is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Contemporary Oriental’s announcement shows that in the above-mentioned fixed increase, Southern Capital Management Co., Ltd. subscribed for approximately 550 million yuan, including 15 million yuan subscribed by Wu Xiubo. Fashion Starlight (Beijing) Culture Media Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Fashion Group, and Its then president, Su Mang, subscribed for 10 million yuan and 5 million yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jiaxuan, the actual controller of Mengjiangwei Company at the time, and two shareholders also signed a gambling agreement with Contemporary Oriental, promising that the net profit of Mengjiangwei Company from 2014 to 2016 would not be less than 100 million each. yuan, 135 million yuan and 200 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mengjiangwei Company also delivered the goods as promised. From 2014 to 2016, Mengjiangwei achieved net profits of 109 million yuan, 141 million yuan and 211 million yuan respectively. Mengjiangwei Company is undoubtedly the biggest performance supporter of Contemporary Oriental. As a reference, the net profit attributable to the parent company of Contemporary Oriental in the same period was 177 million yuan, 111 million yuan and -556,200 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After realizing the bet, Xu Jiaxuan left Contemporary Oriental on July 25, 2017, and the company’s performance immediately changed. Contemporary Oriental&#39;s net profit attributable to shareholders decreased by 38.20% year-on-year that year, and by 1559.79% year-on-year in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Contemporary Oriental responded to inquiries from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2019, stating that the departure of core team members led by Xu Jiaxuan had a certain impact on Mengjiangwei’s business, causing its revenue and profits to decline in 2017. On the other hand, affected by the negative public opinion of film and television actors, Mengjiangwei&#39;s performance in 2018 declined sharply and suffered losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 4, 2022, Contemporary Oriental was delisted by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and delisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One month ago, Southern Capital liquidated its shares of Contemporary Oriental at a transfer price of 0.27 yuan/share, while the price when Wu Xiubo and others subscribed was 10.8 yuan/share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The total clearance transfer price of Southern Capital is 25.3633 million yuan. Southern Capital also reduced its holdings of 7.9138 million shares at a price of 6.358 yuan per share in December 2019, cashing out 50.3159 million yuan. In total, Southern Capital recovered only 75.68 million yuan in Contemporary Oriental stocks, a loss of 86%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another listed company affected by &quot;Sima Yi&quot; is Great Wall Film and Television. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2016, Great Wall Film and Television issued a trading suspension announcement regarding the planning of a major asset restructuring, stating that it planned to acquire Beijing Premiere Times Culture Media Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Great Wall Film and Television responded to inquiries from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that year, it stated that Horgos Premiere Times, a subsidiary of the company it planned to acquire, had signed a contract to receive Huali Company’s 5% investment share in &quot;The Great Military Division Sima Yi&quot;. The investment amount is 20 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Great Wall Film and Television disclosed more details of its agreement with Huali Company in 2018 in response to inquiries from the China Securities Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 25, 2016, the two parties signed a contract and stipulated that Jiangsu Huali would ensure that Premiere Times’ net return on investment in the play would not be less than 70%, and the excess would be shared by Jiangsu Huali and Premiere Times. Share according to the ratio of 60% and 40%. On May 6, the two parties signed a supplementary agreement to adjust the ratio to 70% and 30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above announcement shows that the drama was broadcast in June 2017. Due to subsequent differences between the investors during the execution of the contract, due to the principle of caution during the premiere, no actual investment in the TV drama &quot; Military Advisor Alliance&quot; to confirm revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Great Wall Film and Television subsequently terminated its acquisition of Beijing Premiere Times. On May 7, 2021, Great Wall Film and Television was delisted and delisted by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Wu Xiubo is still the fourth largest circulating shareholder of the listed company Xingfu Blue Ocean (300528.SZ), holding 1.5% of the shares, with a reference market value of 62 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness Blue Ocean is the first state-controlled listed company on the GEM that invests in, produces, and operates the entire film industry chain. Its largest shareholder is Jiangsu Radio and Television Group Co., Ltd., and it was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2011, Happy Blue Ocean recruited 13 strategic investors, and Wu Xiubo subscribed for 45.0384 million yuan and became one of them. Happy Blue Ocean&#39;s prospectus shows that 15.0384 million yuan of Wu Xiubo&#39;s subscription funds are self-owned funds, and the remaining 30 million yuan are borrowed funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness Blue Ocean’s third quarter report for 2023 shows that Wu Xiubo’s shareholdings are frozen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concerning the contract dispute for &quot;The Great Military Advisor Sima Yi&quot;, Wu Xiubo&#39;s agent declined an interview with Southern Weekend reporters.

My pronunciation is actually Japanese pronunciation, because they are almost the same as the pronunciation of &quot;Dunhuang&quot; and &quot;Kumaroshi&quot; when I learned about it more than 20 years ago, so I was very impressed. This impression originated from a documentary produced by Japan&#39;s NHK TV station that I saw at that time: &quot;Silk Road&quot;. I am ashamed to say that before that, I had no understanding of either Dunhuang or Kumarajiva. Later, I gradually learned that Dunhuang has an extraordinary status in the hearts of Japanese people. In October 2018, I went to Dunhuang for the first time due to a meeting. After transferring in Xi&#39;an, I found that I was on the same plane with a Japanese tour group, and the TONKOU images in my memory flashed back frame by frame. At that time, I secretly sighed: Japan’s “Dunhuang Fever” is indeed well-deserved. Speaking of the origin of &quot;Dunhuang fever&quot; in Japan, this book published in 1943 is undoubtedly one of the initiators. Since this book is a &quot;novel&quot;, to avoid spoilers, the content will not be mentioned here. However, readers must have realized by now that it might be a pity to read this book as a novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73794&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70583&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/6ddafb8163.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Killing Season.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1484&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;//images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/6ddafb8163.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260274&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;《 &quot;Killing Season: A History of the Indonesian Genocide 1965-1966&quot;, written by [Additional] Robinson, translated by Xie Kankan and Roger, World Knowledge Press, June 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the six months starting from October 1965, approximately 500,000 members of the Indonesian Communist Party and its affiliated organizations were killed, becoming the leader of the twentieth century. One of the most famous massacres in human history. What was the cause of this massacre? What is the identity of the executioner who carried out the massacre? What role did the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other major powers play in this tragedy? These may be some questions that our general readers will think of. The author of this book is a well-known expert on the politics of Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, although this book is titled &quot;History&quot;, it is not a general straightforward narrative, but has clear analytical features. The author carefully depicts the distribution of the huge energy that triggered the massacre along several cracks within Indonesia such as ideology, military-political relations, religious beliefs, and ethnic identity. Of course, because it involves many complex and sensitive issues such as religion and race relations, the author writes with different shades of ink, which can be said to be prudent; however, the almost rare silence of the countries involved on this incident has been overshadowed by this excellent historical research Totally shattered. The people want the truth, and that is what true learning is about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73795&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70584&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/bda9db9a0d.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Real and Virtual.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1591&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/bda9db9a0d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260275&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Reality and Virtuality: Philosophy in the Post-Truth Era&quot;, by Jin Guantao&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, CITIC Publishing Group, July 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The word &quot;philosophy&quot; in the subtitle of this book actually refers to &quot;philosophy of authenticity&quot;, and the core part of this book can be positioned as &quot;philosophy of science&quot; &quot;Epistemology&quot; or &quot;theory of knowledge.&quot; Having said that, we understand that there is a high threshold to cross in order to read this book. However, the book&#39;s argument is unusually clear because the author has a consistent model throughout. This model is very simple: authenticity R (X, M, Y) is a structure composed of subject X, control means M and object Y. The &quot;authenticity&quot; of object Y only depends on the universal repeatability of M. . So, isn’t this just a repetition of the basic methods of modern scientific research? Not so; the author realizes that authenticity should be divided into three incommensurable fields: science, individual and society, and therefore wants to establish a unified theory for this purpose. In this book, such as the theoretical blind spots of Kuhn, who was famous in the field of scientific philosophy in the 20th century, the &quot;kingdom of lies&quot; spun by humanistic intellectuals who regard themselves as academic leftists in European and American circles, and the opinions of great physicists such as Einstein on mathematical abilities. &quot;Surprised&quot;, and even the properties of gauge field theory and superstring theory, which are the most cutting-edge in theoretical physics, the author has given his own very unique and bold views, which can be said to have great philosophical ambitions. In the process of reading this book, I would often compare it with my own experience gained from studying and researching in recent years. Although the results are similar and different, they all made me think deeply. This can be said to be due to the author&#39;s strong and clear extreme thinking ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73796&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70585&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/5c87f2a91e.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Qiu Chengtong&#39;s Mathematics Concept.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1566&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/5c87f2a91e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260276&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong >;&quot;Truth and Beauty: Qiu Chengtong&#39;s Views on Mathematics&quot;, written by Qiu Chengtong, Jiangsu Phoenix Literature and Art Publishing House, August 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I just finished reading this book, I had a &quot;delusional&quot; thought: Is there a channel for at least all junior high schools, high schools and universities in the country to Have all math teachers read this book? After years of reading, I can see that such original Chinese works that are full of vitality are extremely rare. Reading them makes me feel refreshed. This makes me sigh from time to time: Mr. Qiu is really a powerful gentleman and a great scholar in the world. This great strength is not only reflected in his courageous advancement in mathematical research, but also in his outspoken criticism of the low academic style that takes fame and fortune in the academic world. It is also reflected in his enthusiasm for cultivating students. It is also reflected in the fact that he has a secret that is not easily known to others. The psychological mechanism: &quot;Study the relationship between heaven and man, understand the changes of ancient and modern times, and become a family.&quot; This is the famous saying of Tai Shigong, and I don&#39;t know how many scholars have been inspired. I have seen criticism of him on the Internet, to the general effect that Yau Shing Tong is domineering; for some details of the story, please refer to &quot;My Geometric Life: The Autobiography of Yau Shing Tong&quot;. At that time I thought: Well, as long as the critics can point to one of the above four points, I will accept it; otherwise, please listen to your instructions. In fact, if we look at the Chinese people who have left their names in the history of human science since the 20th century, one of their teachers is Chen Shengren, Yang Zhenning is another, and the third one is Yau Shing-tung. However, in terms of being able to make decisions for real academics and scholars, there may be no one at the moment who can surpass them. Master once said: &quot;Virtue is never alone, it must have neighbors.&quot; Good readers of this book will definitely agree with this statement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73797&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70586&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/254212bb7b.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Conquest and Culture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1622&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/254212bb7b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260277&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Conquest and Culture: A History of the World&quot;, written by&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;[&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;US] Sowell, translated by Jiang Lin, CITIC Publishing Group, October 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The author of this book is a famous black economist, thinker and public intellectual in the United States, and is also labeled as a &quot;black conservative&quot; . Knowing this background, it will be easier to understand the tepid style of the book: although the author is outspoken about the evils caused by the conquest of the major Western colonial empires in the nineteenth century, such as the slave trade and the massacre of Indians, he does not High-profile accusations. His economic perspective gave him an awareness of &quot;conquest and culture&quot; from the perspective of human natural history. For example, the situation of black people on plantations in the United States in the 19th century was better than that on plantations in Latin America. The reason was that the price of purchasing slaves in the United States was relatively high. Naturally, slave owners did not want their property to suffer losses easily, so there was a trend of preferring to hire slaves. Irish immigrants doing dangerous jobs. So, how does the author view the issue of &quot;colonial conquest&quot;? It can be said that the violent conflicts in the current world are still a continuation of this helpless natural history of mankind. The pace of progress of human civilization seems increasingly slow and heavy today. Because of his special ethnic identity, the author&#39;s relatively gentle and tolerant reappearance of this period of history, as well as his quiet criticism of &quot;tribalism&quot;, make his expressions and thoughts more meaningful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The author is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science, East China Normal University)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[作为文本的茶馆丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258517]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/k7XSaOnKmcU72AMhUa66c91RrEJSV10jWfkJLuh9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/k7XSaOnKmcU72AMhUa66c91RrEJSV 10jWfkJLuh9. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di at Heming Tea House in Chengdu People&#39;s Park&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Hua Xiaofeng/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.infzm.com/contents/257991&quot; title=&quot;Wang Di: Historian in the Teahouse&quot;>;Wang Di: Historian in the Teahouse&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di’s generation in Chengdu When people meet, they like to say, &quot;I eat three flowers in my mouth.&quot; &quot;Kouzi&quot; means &quot;Jiekou&quot;. &quot;啖&quot; means &quot;to eat&quot;. Su Dongpo&#39;s famous sentence &quot;Eating three hundred lychees a day&quot; will be pronounced more accurately in Sichuan dialect. This is easy to understand. The term &quot;Three Flowers&quot; requires experienced Chengdu people to explain it in detail before they can understand it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first met Wang Di, I proposed to sit in a teahouse. Wang Di said, let’s meet at Heming Teahouse in People’s Park. At Heming Teahouse, as soon as we sat down, Wang Di explained what &quot;three flowers&quot; were. &quot;When I was a child, I drank third-grade flower tea, which is the most popular tea. I went to the United States in 1991, and when I returned to Chengdu in 1997, I went to a teahouse to drink tea. The tea waiter asked, what kind of tea should I drink? I said, &#39;Sanhua&#39; &#39;. He said that the worst ones now are &#39;special flower&#39; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Special Flower Tea&lt;/span>;).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;From &quot;three flowers&quot; to &quot;special flowers&quot;, it seems to conform to a certain &quot;law&quot; of &quot;rising&quot; along time. Wang Di said that maybe the &quot;Special Flower&quot; now is the &quot;Sanhua&quot; back then, but the name has just been changed. Older Chengdu people say &quot;eat tea with your mouth in mind&quot;. At that time, there was not even the word &quot;三花&quot;. An author signed by &quot;Follower&quot; made a somewhat pessimistic prediction in a Chengdu newspaper in 1942: &quot;As long as society progresses and a replacement for the teahouse appears, it will definitely decline or even cease to exist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Wang Di wrote at the end of &quot;Teahouse: Public Life and Microcosm in Chengdu, 1900-1950&quot;: &quot;A few hours later, they will still open the door of the teahouse just like they did on the first day of the century fifty years ago. They were unloaded piece by piece, but they didn’t know that together with this city, they had entered a completely different era that, although vigorous, no longer belonged to teahouses and tea guests.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to write this Teahouses in different eras, thus &quot;Teahouse: The Decline and Renaissance of Public Life in Chengdu, 1950-2000&quot;. Wang Di was born in 1956 and has more personal experience of Chengdu teahouses during this period. These two books constitute a century-old history of teahouses in Chengdu. &quot;Although the theme of this century-old history is teahouses, it is also a century-old economic history, a century-old social history, a century-old cultural history, a century-old popular history, a century-old history of daily life, and even a century-old Chinese city&#39;s history seen from the microcosm of the teahouse. The history of character.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di&#39;s years of writing about teahouses earned him the second biennial (2018-2019) &quot;Best Book Award&quot; from the American Urban History Society. The award citation said: &quot;This book adopts a multi-disciplinary research orientation, adopts anthropological and sociological research methods and theories, and mines various historical documents, including newspapers, diaries, personal records, and oral data of teahouse culture, so that This research is very in-depth.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For media professionals, Wang Di’s works have a lot to learn from. How to think big from the micro? How to see the times from ordinary people? How to find new ideas from numerous materials? These are common problems we face. Wang Di took me to many places. The feeling of telling history on the spot is extraordinary. It allows people to see three-dimensional and rich details, and naturally compare teahouses and tea guests in time and space. Everything is emotional. The collision and fusion of opinions and rational thoughts will form complex and fresh texts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Texts, or &quot;fragments,&quot; written by specific individuals provide new perspectives on history. Everyone adds their own text to history itself, so that history will be richer and more visible, and it will continue to get closer to the &quot;reality&quot; itself. There is no overall history, only ever-expanding history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[短剧制造者：哪有什么一夜暴富？不过是流量的打工仔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261641]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The shooting scene in Xuanpingli, Dahan, Xi&#39;an.

By comparison, the national movie box office in 2022 will only be 30.067 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past month, this kind of imagination has made capital excited, and stocks related to short dramas have experienced skyrocketing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of November 22, 2023, Tianwei Video and Chinese Online have both increased by more than 140% within the month, and Gravity Media, Guangbo Shares, Jiayun Technology, etc. have increased by more than 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The unfinished story of capital is that this business looks very &quot;rich&quot;, but in fact it is difficult to make money. Many industry insiders told Southern Weekend reporters that the profit rate will not exceed 10%. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;90% of the income is used to pay for advertising on Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat. They are the driving forces behind the short drama’s popularity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a short drama platform told a Southern Weekend reporter that the life of short dramas is given by traffic. It can make you rich overnight, or it can make you lose money overnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said, just like e-commerce and merchants, &quot;If we don&#39;t support you to go online, your goods will sell hundreds of thousands a month, but if we support you, it will be tens of millions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An industry insider explained that according to Douyin’s traffic bidding mechanism, the cost of acquiring customers for short dramas is actually the result of competition with e-commerce, live streaming, games and other industries. Short dramas can acquire customers at a lower cost. Guest, this is the fundamental reason for its rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the ability of other industries to pay for traffic is weakening, and their ability to pay for traffic affects the future of short dramas. &quot;If live broadcasts become popular again next year, or those live broadcast rewards are at the top of the list, If guys are willing to pay for gifts again, they will steal more traffic with higher bids, and this will truly end the future of short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Right now, the leaders in the industry are deploying their own apps in order to seize this period of time and keep users on their own platforms, thereby getting rid of dependence on traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late November, the wild growth of short dramas ushered in a new round of supervision, and the State Administration of Radio and Television once again launched a one-month special rectification work on online micro-short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Major short video platforms have removed a large number of illegal micro-short dramas from the shelves and banned a large number of accounts that have illegally published micro-short dramas. The micro-short drama &quot;Black Lotus&#39; Handbook for Ascension&quot; produced by Mi Meng&#39;s team was removed from the shelves for &quot;exaggerating the bad values ​​of extreme revenge and using violence to counter violence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A short drama platform founder told Southern Weekend reporters that supervision had begun as early as November last year, and starting from March 2023, the platform will also require &quot;review before broadcasting.&quot; In the past year, &quot;Every episode will be reviewed. After review, you will be given clear instructions whether you have passed the review or not, such as too many intimate scenes, etc.&quot; The founder has also had one or two dramas abandoned due to too many revisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since a large number of companies in the industry have transformed from online novel platforms, most companies are equipped with &quot;self-reviewers&quot;. &quot;Overall, it does not have a big impact on us.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, supervision is a good thing. Now everyone is waiting for the &quot;Detailed Rules for the Creation, Production and Content Review of Online Micro-Short Dramas&quot; formulated by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. With it, the waste of investment caused by failure to review will be reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has launched a special rectification work on online micro-short dramas since late November 2022, and has removed from the shelves more than 25,000 short dramas, totaling 1.36 million episodes, and &quot;small-format dramas&quot; that contain illegal content. Programs&quot; 2420. From March 2023 to the present, more than 350,000 episodes (strips) of vulgar and harmful online mini-drama have been cleared, and 429 related &quot;mini programs&quot; and 2,988 accounts have been dealt with at different levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Xi&#39;an has become a center for short dramas&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sorry, my voice is hoarse.&quot; Li Tao has to meet more than a dozen people every day, &quot;Chen Ou flew to Xi&#39;an yesterday, just to gather beautiful and beautiful people. As for Chen Ou, some state-backed companies also came to me to see if there was any possibility of cooperation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao is the founder of Fengxing Studio, which was originally a little-known film and television company. Previously, it mainly produced information flow advertisements and occasionally hosted weddings. I just started filming short plays last year when I couldn&#39;t get any work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin releases an advertising consumption list every week. Being on the list is considered a hit. In the past year, Li Tao filmed 14 short dramas, 9 of which were on the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially &quot;Wushuang&quot;, which was online for 24 hours, had a top-up of more than 50 million, and consumed 100 million ads in 8 days. It became this year&#39;s &quot;King of Dramas&quot; and Feng Xing became a &quot;hot star&quot; in the industry overnight. Fried chicken&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Li Tao was doing information flow advertising before, Xi&#39;an gathered more than half of the country&#39;s information flow advertising shooting team. After the short drama became popular, Xi&#39;an also transformed from an information flow advertising production base to a short drama center. Li Tao said, &quot;Sometimes, nine out of ten hits on the list come from Xi&#39;an.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao moved his office to Xi&#39;an Silk Road Center at the beginning of this year. There is a floor-to-ceiling window with a 270° panoramic view, overlooking the entire Chanba Ecological Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He regards this place as his blessed place. &quot;After moving here, the drama started to explode.&quot; More and more people came to him. He added a large coffee table, prepared a complete set of tea sets, and learned Acting like a southern businessman, he made Kung Fu tea for the guests. &quot; I want to feel happy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What people who come to drink tea are most concerned about is whether there is a password for the popular product? Li Tao&#39;s answer is &quot;book&quot;. A good script plus good production equals a big hit. A good script plus poor production equals a small hit. A bad script plus good production may not necessarily lead to a hit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone re-filmed &quot;Wushuang&quot;, &quot;I just changed the character names, even the actors&#39; sentences were the same, and the result was still a hit, which shows that the script is really good,&quot; Li Tao said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He can read dozens of scripts a week and has developed a skill. &quot;After watching the first episode, I can guess the content of the next dozen episodes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these production teams, only by making hits can they have the opportunity to select good scripts. Only by selecting good scripts can they have the opportunity to make more hits. In order to get a good script, they are even willing to advance funding for filming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what kind of book will explode? &quot;This is a metaphysics.&quot; Li Tao is more confident about how to present a good script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I found the feeling of filming a short play was during the Spring Festival this year. At 3 a.m. on the sixth day of the lunar month, he checked the surveillance on his mobile phone and found that two shareholders were working overtime in the office to edit a film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fengxing has six shareholders, all of whom have been friends for more than ten years. Li Tao felt uncomfortable, &quot;My brothers are working overtime, and I am celebrating the New Year at home. This is not going to work. I called the others and said, Let’s go to the company and work overtime together.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around four in the morning, six people were editing a film in the company. The first episode was cut out to 3 minutes, but the pace was not fast enough and the impact was not strong enough. Everyone started arguing while talking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One side believed that the story should be complete and the main line should be clearly explained. The other side believed that the pace should be fast and the impact should be strong. No one could convince anyone. The final decision was that &quot;one person would cut one version and compare it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After comparing the two versions, the controversy disappeared. &quot;The audience will definitely know what this is about through two short sentences.&quot; Li Tao explained to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The core of the short play is The rhythm, if it is very long, it will be over if you feel relaxed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short dramas need to subvert many concepts in the past. The experience of the traditional film and television industry has become a burden for short dramas. Now, compared to mature actors in the traditional sense, Li Tao prefers actors with experience in short plays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Xi&#39;an has become a center for short dramas.

Photographed by Southern Weekend reporter Luo Huanhuan&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Between being happy and not happy&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wu Shuang&quot; tells the story of the male protagonist Chu Qing who helps his wife make a comeback. After the wife becomes famous, she dislikes her husband and wants to divorce. But she didn&#39;t know that Chu Qing&#39;s other identity was the supreme master of the Dragon Palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This drama has never explained what the Dragon Palace is, why it has supreme power, why Chu Qing needs to conceal his identity, he has to prove his identity, why can&#39;t he just say it...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Tao’s experience is that there is no need to pursue logic and rationality. “Many themes are fictitious. You don’t need to worry about which dynasty it is, or trace whether it is from the Song Dynasty or the Tang Dynasty. It is just a costume drama, the Three Palaces and Six Dynasties.” The courtyard is a matter between the emperor and his concubines.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to the short drama is to control the audience&#39;s emotions and keep them in a state of &quot;between being happy and not yet happy&quot;. A small hook must be left at the end of each episode to make everyone want to read on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first and paid episodes are the key to a short drama. Li Tao&#39;s experience is that people must be retained in the first episode, and paid episodes are usually set before the biggest suspense is solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On average, editors at Fengxing Studio edit 1.6 episodes of short dramas a day, including the first episode and paid episodes, which usually take 5 to 15 days. Editor Er Pang told Southern Weekend reporters that their requirement is that &quot;every frame must be meaningful&quot; and there is no way to add water to a short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao described that a good screenwriter can stabilize the audience&#39;s emotions, set a hook every time, and untie the hook reasonably, so that the suspense is still there and the audience will not lose patience. For example, the male protagonist has been suppressed for two episodes, and his emotions are almost suppressed. A small reversal is interspersed to stabilize the audience&#39;s emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of high-reversal, high-frequency, fast-paced plot is designed to stop the brain from thinking. &quot;As soon as you think about it, I fail,&quot; a short drama producer told a Southern Weekend reporter , &quot;When you think about it later, you will wonder whether the money was worth it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao introduced, &quot;We meet the needs of users in minutes,&quot; which is faster and more exciting. It is denser, has more reversals and fuller emotions. He believes that short plays have created an unprecedented form of film and television. &quot;I have never seen anything so dramatic in the history of film. No matter how good the film is, it cannot be cut into one minute.&quot; Sell ​​by the minute.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the professional shooting team in Hengdian, these &quot;people on the margins of the film and television industry&quot; in Xi&#39;an have an advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They once visited Hengdian for inspection and found that they still use traditional film and television techniques to shoot short dramas. The sound and pictures are recorded separately, the picture quality is 4K, and large machines are used to shoot on site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production team in Xi&#39;an can sometimes shoot a 100-minute drama in four days. In order to improve efficiency, the picture and sound are recorded at the same time. The picture quality is 2K. All shooting machines are handheld and no large machines are used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some traditional film and television people will also come to Li Tao to communicate. He obviously feels that, &quot;From the other side&#39;s heart, they don&#39;t like short dramas, and they feel that they are doing big dramas. But this does not exist Many big teams looked down on dimensionality reduction at first, but then they wanted to do it but found that they couldn&#39;t do it. This is a very common phenomenon in short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a year, this office that brought good luck to Li Tao was already overcrowded. On the day of the interview with Southern Weekend reporters, Li Tao had just found a new office, &quot;more than a thousand square meters.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The protagonist is either a security guard or a delivery person”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Wang Xiaoshu started filming short plays in 2021, no one was optimistic about the short plays. “The first batch of people who filmed short plays , taking me as an example, they may all be losers.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, he founded Jia Shu Technology, a free novel platform. &quot;The business will not close, but it is not very good either.&quot; Seeing the story experts on Kuaishou, he felt that it was very similar to online novels. &quot;If we produce novels such as Son-in-law and God of War, which we are good at, there should be a market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2021, he filmed his first short drama &quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot;. He didn&#39;t use a film camera, just a camera. &quot;It&#39;s a bit too much to call it a drama. You can&#39;t imagine how crude it is.&quot; The budget was 30,000 yuan to shoot for 100 minutes. &quot;I didn&#39;t even accept weddings, saying it was too cheap.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He remembered that, including Jia Shu Technology, there were maybe four short drama companies at that time. &quot;The protagonist of the short play is either a security guard or a food delivery guy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He found a Kuaishou expert in Tongnan, Chongqing. &quot;In Tongnan, one led one by one, and there were several teams specializing in photographing security guards. Their names were all very crude, and they were called &#39;shooting jokes&#39;.&quot; &#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to film a story, Wang Xiaoshu flew from Shanghai to Chongqing Jiangbei Airport, then took a three-hour bus ride, and finally met his heroine in a remote town - a story with millions of fans. Blogger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This business is also very magical to me, and I don’t know how to shoot it.” Wang Xiaoshu asked the expert to shoot the popular content on Kuaishou again. “At that time, I can’t say that I was polishing it. , I can only say that in order to extend the time, enrich the dialogue, and add a bit of conflict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose is to leave space for recharging. &quot;Users have to watch about 10 minutes before paying, and the whole show is only 30 minutes. It feels bad to pay. For fifty, sixty, seventy or eighty episodes, users The recharge space will be larger.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everything is very primitive, there are no actors, &quot;her grandfather, grandmother, and cousin came to help&quot;, and the venue did not cost any money, &quot;just in front of a factory that has stopped production.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was very hot in Chongqing in July, so I had to take a break after taking a photo. Wang Xiaoshu squatted in front of the factory with an umbrella and finished the photoshoot in four days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other party also suspected that he was a liar and asked him to pay the money in one lump sum. The reason was: &quot;A similar story has been published on Kuaishou. If you shoot it again, will anyone see it?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu actually had no idea, &quot;it was too shoddy&quot;, but he soon discovered that he was wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Middle-aged and elderly people love to watch it&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;He bought 100,000 yuan of traffic for &quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot; on the WeChat public account, and then played it on the mini program after on-demand viewing. The reason why we choose mini programs is that it is much easier than promoting apps. After all, the cost for users to download and install is very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The platform charges a channel fee from the recharge he withdraws. The channel fee for the WeChat mini program has risen to 5-8 yuan per 100 yuan, while Douyin only costs 1-2 yuan, but WeChat is still the big one. &quot;Short drama&quot; The audience is more accustomed to using WeChat to pay, and Douyin needs to be redirected, which will create an additional payment obstacle.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot; has returned about 100,000 in almost 20 days,&quot; which gave Wang Xiaoshu a premonition that this model could work. &quot;There are still people watching this crude production, so let&#39;s make it better. You can get your money back.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The short dramas that became popular at first were all security dramas, and their audience was also summarized as the &quot;three guarantees&quot; personnel, &quot;security guards, cleaners, and nannies.&quot; However, Wang Xiaoshu discovered through the backstage that these people were not necessarily low-income groups. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After accumulating tens of millions of fans, Wang Xiaoshu made user portraits and found that half of them were over 45 years old. “Most people may think that when people get older, they stop reading. We found that when people get older, It’s very impressive to see.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After starting his business for more than four years, Wang Xiaoshu interacts with this group of people every day. He feels that the entertainment life of middle-aged and elderly people is very lacking. &quot;Young people have many activities and do not need to consume online. These dramas are not cheap. An episode costs about 60 cents, and 100 minutes costs 60 yuan. Middle-aged and elderly people have both money and leisure.&quot; Moreover, young people are very familiar with the Internet. &quot;You can find pirated copies if you search casually, and it is difficult to pay for short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entry threshold for short plays is also very low. &quot;No need to think, no need to read, no need to think, everything is placed in front of you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It completely follows the classification system of online articles, which is divided into male channels and female channels according to the gender of the audience. The consumption psychology of the two groups is also different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Female video drama consumers are all grandmothers or mothers, and the most popular themes are sadomasochism and sweet pets. Wang Xiaoshu felt that they were &quot;still very eager and longing for love.&quot; Their marriage may have been like this. They had never been in love when they were young, and they longed to be cared for. &quot;It should be said that people need to be loved throughout their lives.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More men watch short dramas than women, and the male dramas dominate. God of War is the most popular theme, followed by son-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The self-media &quot;Short Drama Study Room&quot; found based on the statistics of the streaming list released by Douyin that among the popular short dramas from January to July 2023, the theme of God of War accounted for 32.98%, ranking second. It is a female video drama with a sadomasochistic theme, accounting for only 9.42%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;God of War&quot; refers to a person with a powerful identity who hides his identity and transforms into a small person. He is bullied by the villain and finally reveals his identity to fight back against the opponent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu said that security guards or couriers will make the audience feel more involved. &quot;In reality, these groups are not respected, but in dreams they are very powerful and have status.&quot; It empathizes with the suppression and is released from the protagonist&#39;s counterattack. &quot;Dignity is something that many men lack on a daily basis.&quot; Wang Xiaoshu believes that short dramas can satisfy them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Short plays are used to create dreams. What does a dream look like? The dream is when he threatens you with &#39;bad reviews&#39;, and you suddenly laugh and say, &#39;Actually, I am a rich second generation, I will Being a delivery boy is just about experiencing life, but has it suddenly changed?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wushuang&quot; combines the elements of God of War and son-in-law. &quot;The male protagonist conceals his identity and becomes the son-in-law, not because he is not strong enough. It&#39;s because I like that woman, and her strong identity will always be made public.&quot; Li Tao feels, &quot;People who are suppressed by their wives or mother-in-law in life can be greatly released here.&quot; &lt;p>; com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/e2488df4d8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2337&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/30/e2488df4d8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260288&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Wushuang&quot;, online for 24 hours recharge With over 50 million, he became this year’s “King of Dramas”. Picture source: Video screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unexpectedly small profits&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After March 2022, Wang Xiaoshu suddenly discovered that the entire industry began to skyrocket. “In two or three months, the company’s revenue scale went from several to One million suddenly increased to tens of millions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin and WeChat became interoperable at the end of 2021, and short dramas became the beneficiaries. Wang Xiaoshu said that in the past, when buying traffic from official accounts, 40% might be recovered on the first day. After Douyin allowed jumping to the WeChat mini program, “the recovery on the same day was 100%.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin also invited short drama platforms to stream in March 2022 (that is, merchants pay to increase traffic), which brought a huge turnaround to the industry. At its peak, Douyin’s short dramas invested in Stream consumption is 80 million a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu believes that the first year of short dramas is 2021. In June of that year, the WeChat ecosystem opened up short dramas for streaming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there had been a large number of micro-short plays before that. For example, Tencent Video’s “Please! &quot;Don&#39;t Spoil Me&quot;, the amount of the split account in the third season reached 32.49 million yuan, and it is known as the &quot;King of Drama&quot; in the split account short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But these short plays are not paid short plays. Their commercial realization relies on platform subsidies, and the bulk of the investment is still production fees. &quot;please! The production cost of &quot;Don&#39;t Spoil Me&quot; is as high as 20 million, and the advertising cost is only a few million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Essentially, these short dramas still follow the business model of long videos. The broadcast platform splits the bill with the producer based on the click rate of 1,000 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paid short drama adopts the business model of online novels. The monetization path is for users to pay for on-demand viewing, but more than 90% of the income must be used to pay advertising fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This business model is completely rooted in the CPS model of online novels, that is, the copyright owner opens the promotion link to distributors, and the distributors create secondary creations of the materials and publish them through Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat official accounts. Attract users to recharge, and both parties will split accounts according to the recharge amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the top short drama companies have been in the novel business before, such as Chinese Online, Dianzhong, Peanuts, etc., all have their own online distribution systems. They are the core of the industry, the copyright holders, and hold the most important resource - the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its upstream is connected to producers such as Fengxing Studio. The copyright owner will give the other party some guaranteed fees. The part of the shooting cost that exceeds the guarantee must be borne by the producer himself, and the profit will be divided in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its downstream is the distribution distributor. The copyright owner provides technology and content and takes 15% from the recharge. There are also short drama companies that do their own distribution. Jiuzhou Culture is a company that is famous for its castings, with a casting team of 300 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Distribution is the lowest level of the short drama industry, and it is also the most mysterious and low-key group of people. Mou Changqing is very familiar with several leading short drama platforms. He is the founder of the short drama community &quot;28 Push&quot;. The main members of this community are the platforms, distributors and producers of short dramas. , script side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Most of the well-established distributors keep a low profile and never show off their cakes because they are afraid of being poached.&quot; When he saw some media reports claiming that the short play was created by a team of e-commerce brushing orders, he believed this was inconsistent with the facts. “The mainstream short drama platforms I know of include their main distributors, and none of them used to do e-commerce brushing orders. of&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Distribution is a resource-hungry industry. &quot;Most of the good distribution is due to a good relationship with the platform.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rate of return on traffic refers to the money that users recharge after buying traffic. Mou Changqing said, &quot;If the information provider invests in streaming, if it is a private e-commerce company, it would be good if it can repay 60% to 80% of the cost on the same day, because the private sector relies on follow-up to slowly repay the cost. If the live broadcast does not repay the cost on the same day, it will lose money. &quot;The return on investment must reach 150% to make money. In comparison, short dramas can reach 130% if done well.&quot; Mou Changqing said that short dramas are also one of the few projects that can return the money on the same day. Many powerful distribution companies They all chose to do short plays, &quot;thinking they can grab this piece of cake.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Min, the founder of &quot;Short Drama Expert&quot;, has also done short drama distribution business. He and Mou Changqing have different views. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the return rate of a short drama must reach 120%. It&#39;s not easy. &quot;A drama that can achieve such a rate of return can be regarded as a &#39;magic drama&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is actually very difficult to make money from short drama streaming. Yan Min said, &quot;As long as the return rate exceeds 105%, I will continue to invest. 100 yuan of advertising, 105 yuan of recharge, and 5 yuan paid to Tencent , labor is actually a loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that the core of investment is to start with volume. If you recharge 100 million yuan, the profit rate is only 1%, and you can still make 1 million yuan. There is no minimum amount. After recharging 100,000 yuan, the profit margin is 10%, and the profit is only 10,000 yuan, which is still a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin’s streaming system can set the rate of return. For example, if you invest 100,000 first, the return rate will be 110%. Only if the user recharges 110,000 will the next round of investment be triggered. Distributors will expand their scale as much as possible without losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Min said that distribution is an industry with high labor costs and thin profit margins. “For a small team of fifty or sixty pitchers, no one will care about you at all. If you have more than 200 pitchers, profitable&quot;. In the entire industry chain, distributors have the lowest threshold and the thinnest profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Content is king in short plays, and the copyright owner has the highest threshold, and they are the main ones who can make money. They can only provide technology and content and let distributors bear the cost of distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The producers also bear risks. Wang Xiaoshu said, &quot;To shoot 30 dramas a month, the content cost is 10 million. If the box office is not 100 million, wouldn&#39;t it be a loss? This does not include the platform&#39;s own manpower expenses and other expenses, but only the content cost. Most platforms still lose money. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The real winner is only the traffic side&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Short dramas are already a red ocean. Wang Xiaoshu calculated an account. According to the daily consumption calculations previously announced by Douyin, the monthly short drama sales It’s about 2 billion, corresponding to about 700 new dramas. The production cost of a drama is about 300,000 yuan, and the average revenue per unit is 3 million yuan, which means it is just profitable. In fact, the hits took most of the share, and most of the short plays were less than 3 million, which means they lost money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mou Changqing said, &quot;Many media think that if you recharge 30 million, you can earn 30 million. If the return rate is set to 110%, the gross profit will be only 3 million.&quot; After deducting various costs, The profit is only 1 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Min believes that &quot;those people deliberately make it so easy, just to cut leeks and let others invest.&quot; Some bosses in traditional industries mistakenly believe that investing hundreds of thousands can generate tens of millions in income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real winner in the short drama industry is only the traffic side. Most of the revenue goes to Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat, leaving only about 10% of the industry’s profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Producers generally need to pay for filming. &quot;I have paid a little too hard recently, and now I am a little scared.&quot; Li Qiang, the boss of Xi&#39;an Gewu Qianfan, told Southern Weekend reporters that he has already paid for a movie. The skit has more than 1 million posts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the guaranteed production fee given by the copyright owner, the purpose of their payment is to improve the quality. &quot;It makes no sense for me to earn your 108,000 or 80,000 yuan production fee. What I want is to split the account,&quot; he asked. Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;50,000 or 5 million, which one do you want?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has been in the short drama circle for less than half a year. This is the first short drama he has invested in. &quot;I see this. &quot;Definitely win&quot;, if you can&#39;t win, it&#39;s just paying for your hobby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, Li Tao is more cautious than the newcomers, &quot;I am not willing to shoot a short drama with a production cost of more than 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.&quot; He made some calculations, &quot;If you shoot a drama with more than 300,000 yuan, you can make a profit by recharging it to 3 million. For 600,000, you need to recharge 7 to 8 million to make a profit. How many dramas can have a recharge of tens of millions?&quot; What?&quot; He hopes to make some more stable money, &quot;I can make 200,000 yuan per movie, and I can do 50 movies a year, and I will still make a good profit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Nan, the boss of Xi’an Muniu Liuma Film and Television, has released three hit movies. “Not even the third one on the list, but the first and second ones.” However, he told Southern Weekend reporters that he is in a difficult situation now. The capital chain is broken, &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can survive until next month.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film or online drama industry, teams are often formed temporarily, but short drama production companies need assembly line production. Chen Nan has four shooting teams with more than 40 people. Not counting rent, &quot;each The monthly salary is two to three hundred thousand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao said frankly, &quot;I can responsibly say that less than 10% of people in this industry can actually make money, and 90% are losing money.&quot; He used himself as an example. They filmed nine After a short play, the first hit came out, &quot;But everyone only saw &#39;wolf eating meat&#39;, not &#39;wolf being beaten&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, Chen Ou announced that he was actively watching short dramas. A month later, he told Southern Weekend reporters that he was &quot;still in the learning and research stage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 26, the famous Hong Kong director Wang Jing appeared at the opening ceremony of a short drama. This may be the first opening ceremony held by the short drama industry. You know, vertical screen short dramas Cast and crew names never appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[监察官等级首次确定工作全面完成]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261626]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;As of mid-November, 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) across the country and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps City For the first time, the work of determining the grade of county-level supervisors has been completed. This marks the successful conclusion of the first determination of the national supervisory officer level, which will be carried out since 2022. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Doing a good job in determining the level of supervisors is an important measure to deepen the reform of the national supervision system. It is a practical need to build a high-quality professional discipline inspection and supervision iron army. It is also important for building supervision with Chinese characteristics. It is of great significance to strengthen the official system, uphold and improve the party and state supervision system, and promote the high-quality development of disciplinary inspection and supervision work. Under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission took the lead in carrying out the work from top to bottom and level by level. Local party committees, disciplinary inspection commissions and supervisory commissions resolutely shouldered their political responsibilities and strictly followed the &quot;Procurators Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and &quot;Measures for the Management of Supervisory Officer Levels (Trial)&quot; and other relevant regulations to steadily and orderly advance the work of determining the level of supervisors for the first time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Each provincial-level Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Committee took the initiative to report to the party committee at the same level and put forward suggestions for overall planning and promotion plans. The main leaders of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee presided over two meetings to study the determination of the level of supervisors; the Deep Reform Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee will promote the determination of the level of supervisors into annual work points and monitor the whole process; the main leaders of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee issued instructions twice, requiring careful attention Organize and implement meticulously. Under the leadership of party committees at the same level, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions of Hebei, Shandong, Shanghai, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jilin, Jiangxi and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps studied and issued work guidance opinions, detailing the scope of personnel, approval procedures, disciplinary requirements, etc. The Guangdong production and hair production work template provides key reminders on links or matters prone to errors; Hainan establishes a problem ledger to study and solve existing problems one by one to ensure accurate grasp of policies, standard work procedures, and strict disciplinary requirements. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Considering the determination of the level of supervisors as an important task, the disciplinary inspection and supervision agencies at all levels conscientiously organize and implement it and advance it prudently and steadily. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission issued 2 questions and answers on the first determination of supervisory officer levels, carefully answered inquiries from various places, promptly summarized and published the experience and practices of the completed provinces, and promoted exchanges and mutual learning. Provincial Discipline Inspection Commissions and Supervisory Committees, based on actual conditions, generally adopt methods such as issuing question and answer sessions, holding special training courses, and carrying out policy presentations to strengthen guidance and standardize procedures. The Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions of Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Tianjin, Yunnan, Chongqing, Anhui and other places have established a working mechanism in which the main responsible comrades take the lead, the leaders in charge are responsible, the organizational departments organize the implementation, and the functional departments closely cooperate, and set up special work teams , take the initiative to strengthen communication and docking with the Party Committee Organization Department, institutional establishment and other departments, and work together to study and solve problems. Guizhou has selected some municipal (state) Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions to conduct field surveys to study and solve existing difficult problems; Qinghai has organized special dispatch meetings according to different time nodes; since November, Ningxia has insisted on &quot;daily reporting&quot; to solve policy confusion encountered and process control and other issues; Shanxi summarizes the progress of the province&#39;s work every month, provides &quot;point-to-point&quot; supervision and guidance for slow progress, and ensures that the work determined by the inspector for the first time is advanced in layers and carried out in an orderly manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Insist on putting political standards first, strictly standardize conditions, and strictly review and control. Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committees at all levels strictly compare the conditions for serving as supervisors, conduct a comprehensive survey of institutions, personnel, establishment, etc., comprehensively consider the performance of cadres&#39; moral integrity, job grades, etc., and scientifically and rationally determine grades in accordance with regulations and laws. Together with organizations, public security, economic and credit and other units, we will review the cadres’ academic qualifications, annual assessments, party conduct and clean government, credit reports, spouses and children’s immigration abroad (overseas), etc., and will not confirm those who do not meet the conditions. At the same time, we actively explain policies, provide ideological guidance, and take the initiative to have heart-to-heart conversations with cadres to ensure the ideological stability of the team. Fujian will review and judge one by one the establishment status, job rank, length of service, assessment rewards and punishments, academic qualifications, personal matters, party style and integrity of the cadres to be included in the determined scope; Tibet will establish accounts and list specific lists according to the cadre management authority. Check carefully and confirm again and again. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Taking the opportunity of carrying out the first determination work, efforts will be made to promote the construction of a team of high-quality professional inspectors. Constitutional oaths, targeted training, knowledge competitions and other forms are commonly used in various places to educate and guide cadres to faithfully perform their legal duties and obligations, continuously enhance the awareness of the rule of law, procedures and evidence, and improve the level of standardization, rule of law and formalization. Combining thematic education and educational rectification, we should deepen the internalization and transformation of the party&#39;s innovative theories, highlight practical training and practical exercises, and vigorously improve the political quality and disciplinary and legal literacy of inspectors. Beijing compiled the &quot;Handbook of What Inspections and Supervisors Should Know and Should Meet&quot; and made public examinations a necessary process for determining the level of inspectors; Guangxi organized knowledge tests on party discipline and laws and regulations; Xinjiang relied on the online learning platform of the discipline inspection and supervision system to organize learning for disciplinary inspection and supervision cadres Relevant policies: Hunan guided 14 cities and states to hold ombudsman constitutional oath ceremonies to enhance the sense of professional responsibility and honor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“In the next step, we will guide all localities to carry out the regular determination and promotion of the level of inspectors in accordance with the provisions of the Inspectors Law and the Measures for the Administration of Levels of Inspectors.” Central Commission for Discipline Inspection National Relevant comrades from the Organization Department of the Supervisory Committee said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以自伤自残来控制对方也是家暴：应确认成年人自负其责原则丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261570]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Supreme Court released a number of typical cases against domestic violence. One of the cases was: Li repeatedly threatened his wife Wang by jumping off a building and drinking pesticide in front of her at her workplace. In order to ensure personal safety, Wang applied to the court for a personal safety protection order. The court held that: Li&#39;s self-injury behavior would cause Wang to feel nervous and fearful, which was a mental violation. Wang&#39;s application met the legal conditions for a personal safety protection order. Ruling: Li is prohibited from committing domestic violence against Wang; Li is prohibited from harassing, stalking, and threatening Wang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The typical significance of this case is expressed as: &quot;The harm of mental violence is not less than the harm of physical violence. In this case, although the respondent did not commit any acts such as beating or mutilation, the applicant The person causes physical injury, but his self-injury and self-mutilation behavior will definitely make the applicant feel nervous and fearful, causing the applicant to be mentally unstable and act according to the applicant&#39;s will. This behavior is mental violence.&quot; &quot;Clearly adopted The behavior of harming oneself in order to control the other party is also considered domestic violence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, this case should establish the following rules: Either one of the spouses will cry, make trouble, and hang themselves, or threaten the other party to commit suicide. Injuring yourself to require the other party to meet your specific requirements (whether the request is reasonable or not) is an act of mind control/psychological violence/domestic violence against the other party, so the other party will receive judicial relief. Of course, it is necessary to ensure that men and women enjoy equal judicial protection, that new rules apply to both men and women, and that the principles of equal rights for men and women and equal rights and responsibilities for each party are respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, this case has received a lot of concern, discussion and questioning. It is necessary to ask questions: The man threatens the woman by jumping off a building or going to her workplace to drink pesticides. What is the content of the threat? The basic facts of the case only state that &quot;both parties often have disputes over trivial family matters.&quot; The content of the dispute and the positions of both parties are crucial to determining who is right and wrong. From the &quot;frequent disputes&quot; between the two parties to the &quot;self-injury&quot; of the man, the conflict has an escalation process. How is this escalation completed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of this case is: &quot;Wang&#39;s application for a personal safety protection order case - threatening others through self-injury and self-harm is domestic violence&quot;, and the set keywords are &quot;self-injury, self-harm, mental control&quot;. The logical chain from self-injury to mental control/psychological violence/domestic violence is: one party says &quot;If you don&#39;t agree to my request and don&#39;t act according to my will, I will hurt myself&quot; + this means that the other party &quot; Produce tension and fear&quot; and cause the other party to &quot;not be free mentally.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, there are two points that may deserve further discussion. First, according to this logical chain, many different types of &quot;verbal violence&quot; by one party should also be recognized as mind control/psychological violence/domestic violence, because they can also cause the other party to &quot;generate tension and fear&quot; and cause the other party to &quot; The spirit is not free.&quot; For example, one party devalues ​​the personality, dignity and achievements of the other party through habitual and persistent complaints or derogatory and insulting remarks, in order to lower the other party&#39;s self-evaluation and thereby better manipulate the other party; or one party Make ridiculous or harsh demands, make exaggerated or false accusations against the other party, force the other party to give up their rights and self-esteem, and hand over control of their property and income, in order to control the other party mentally and financially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the above case, some netizens asked: &quot;Both parties often have disputes over trivial family matters.&quot; So during the dispute, did the woman commit &quot;verbal violence&quot; or mental violence against the man? If the man unilaterally and continuously engages in mental control/psychological violence/domestic violence against the woman through self-mutilation, why not file for divorce? In current judicial practice, domestic violence is a very sufficient cause for divorce. From the above details, it is difficult to see the necessity of maintaining this marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this we might as well extend our thinking: In a relationship between a lover or a couple, if one party injures himself or herself, does the other party need to be held responsible for this? The answer is self-explanatory. Because self-injury persons, as persons with full capacity for civil conduct and adults of sound mind, should bear their own responsibility and bear all the consequences of their actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a court in Inner Mongolia decided a case, which caused huge controversy. The prosecutor alleged: On September 28, 2020, E Moumou drove his wife Chao Moumou to the Tongug Nur Pastoral Area of ​​Bayanhot Town to visit their daughter in a car. The two had a quarrel and dispute over whether they needed to go to the pastoral area to visit their daughter. While the vehicle was driving, Chao suddenly opened the rear door of the vehicle and jumped out of the vehicle. He died of severe brain injury after landing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media reports are more specific: The man drove his wife to see their 3-year-old daughter. The two of them kept quarreling over the issue of &quot;eating hot pot&quot; on the way... The wife said that she just wanted to eat hot pot now and didn&#39;t want to see the children. The man insisted on seeing the child first. When the wife saw that her husband had no intention of turning the car around to take her to eat hot pot, she became angry and made an unexpected move: she opened the door and jumped out of the car while the car was still running. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, the court held that the man&#39;s &quot;overconfidence&quot; caused the death of one person, constituting the crime of negligent death, and sentenced the man to two years in prison and three years of probation. The problem is that the woman did not give any warning before jumping out of the car. According to the rules and legal principles established by the above-mentioned typical cases of the Supreme Court, jumping from a car is like jumping off a building or taking pesticides. It is an act of self-harm. The person should also know the consequences of his actions, and there is no reason to hold the other party responsible. Article 66 of the Road Traffic Safety Law also stipulates: Passengers... shall not act in a manner that affects the driver&#39;s safe driving. It is impossible to establish such rules and legal principles: In the relationship between husband and wife, if one party harms himself or threatens the other party to obey, if he does not die, he will exercise mental control/mental violence/domestic violence on the other party. If he dies, it will be the other way around, and the other party will be responsible. criminal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, the only correct rule is that adults and no one else should be held responsible for their actions. To &quot;strive to make the people feel fairness and justice in every judicial case&quot;, the rules and legal principles presented in each case in judicial practice should be reasonable, consistent and systematic, so that the people can have stable expectations and Sense of fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 18:25:17 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
