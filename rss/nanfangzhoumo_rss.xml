The waiter looked incomprehensible. At the same time, during the meal, the two of them also experienced service that felt like they were being left out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This move has caused many netizens to wonder: What is this cotton doll? Is the brain circuit normal for asking a &quot;rag doll&quot; to sit in a baby seat? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, cotton dolls have become a popular subculture among young people. Many young people do regard cotton dolls as &quot;babies&quot;. keep. What kind of existence is a cotton doll? Why is it so popular among young people? Does this subcultural market have a future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/ni51QRY50TXv8muNPN90kKaOc7DZwdJjwf7SagHV.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;734&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/ni51QRY50TXv8muNPN90kKaOc7DZwdJjwf7SagHV.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254709&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;From support object to “raised as a baby”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cotton doll refers to a body length ranging from 10 to 40 cm, with a main body made of cotton , dolls made of polyester fiber, etc. Cotton dolls were first used as a support item in the Korean entertainment industry. In 2015, a Korean brokerage company took the lead in cartoonizing the images of entertainment stars and making cotton dolls, which became a support item for fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Afterwards, cotton dolls became widely popular in the fan circle, and fans began to DIY cotton dolls based on their idols, which could be used as support items or as collections for fans. idol peripherals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After that, Cotton Dolls spread from the Korean entertainment industry to our country and developed completely new. Domestic cotton dolls not only exist as fan products, they have also formed an independent track - many &quot;baby mothers&quot; design unique cotton dolls themselves, start groups on the platform, and then let manufacturers make them after the group is successfully formed. After the goods are delivered, the &quot;baby mother&#39;s&quot; journey of raising a baby begins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Using the classification of baby circles, cotton dolls are divided into two categories: &quot;with attributes&quot; and &quot;without attributes&quot;. &quot;Having attributes&quot; means having prototypes, or celebrities, or some authorized film and television characters. They are more products of the fan economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;No attributes&quot;, that is, there is no prototype. The cotton doll is the original creation of the &quot;baby mother&quot; and can be &quot;customized&quot; according to her own preferences. The domestic cotton doll circle is dominated by cotton dolls with &quot;no attributes&quot;. Many young people &quot;raise cotton dolls as babies.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Cotton Beauty Doll&quot; Weibo Super Chat, established in 2019, now has more than 1.46 million &quot;baby mothers&quot; and more than 3.7 million posts. Read More than 28 billion times. The super chatty posts are mainly about cotton dolls with “no attributes”. According to the &quot;2021 Cotton Dolls Player Insight Report&quot; released by Weidian, the main trading platform of Cotton Dolls, in early 2022, among the army of Cotton Dolls players, the post-00s generation accounted for the highest proportion, reaching 43%, followed by the post-95s generation, which ranked second. Reaching 26%, the online transaction volume of Cotton Dolls exceeded the 1 billion yuan mark that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It can be said that cotton dolls have formed a spectacular subcultural phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/ZwnTwoNo1EJJ17WDBbQr3mWMky2SR5TfFDQSfCSe.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/ZwnTwoNo1EJJ17WDBbQr3mWMky2SR5TfFDQSfCSe.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254710&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;The healing feeling of “raising a baby”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Generation Z users account for 70% of Cotton Doll players. Why are the younger generations obsessed with it? A cotton doll? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As far as those cotton dolls with &quot;attributes&quot; are concerned, they are mainly an extension of the rice circle culture. For example, cotton dolls based on idols are like the incarnation of idols, which can satisfy fans&#39; emotional projection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But for those DIY, &quot;attributeless&quot; cotton dolls, the fun lies in the emotional healing of &quot;raising as a baby&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although those DIY cotton dolls have different facial features and shapes, they have one strong thing in common, they are very cute. &quot;Cute&quot; is mainly used to express those people, things and things that can inspire people&#39;s extremely strong and profound emotions, including liking, admiration, being fascinated by them, persistence, excitement, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the one hand, everyone has the love of &quot;cute&quot;. Austrian zoologist Konrad Lorenz put forward the idea of ​​&quot;larval retention&quot;. He pointed out that it is human nature to like anything with larval characteristics, and these cute animals have big eyes, big heads, short noses, etc. Characteristics, which can also explain why young children, kittens, and puppies are more likely to arouse people&#39;s affection. In the same way, cotton dolls that retain the characteristics of juveniles are very kawaii, full of cuteness, and enchanting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, &quot;cute&quot; has an emotional healing function. From a psychological perspective, a series of things that are non-aggressive, peaceful and non-controversial, can soothe the soul and give people a continuous and long-lasting sense of comfort, can help people resolve sentimental emotions such as loneliness and depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The process of &quot;raising&quot; cotton dolls as babies by the young Generation Z is like the emotional investment of the little prince in the rose in &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. The little prince put up a screen for the rose, covered it with a glass cover, got rid of the caterpillars, and listened to her complaints. He devoted time, emotion and energy; the same goes for every young man who raises cotton dolls, buying clothes and clothes for his own dolls. I changed clothes, confided my feelings to him, took him to travel everywhere, took him to Haidilao to celebrate his birthday...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Like a rose to the little prince It is unique, and every cotton doll that receives the emotional investment of the &quot;baby mother&quot; is also unique to the &quot;baby mother&quot;. Therefore, it is normal to not understand the young people who brought cotton dolls to eat Haidilao in the news, but there is no need to rush to ridicule and deny them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is also worth mentioning that unlike many subculture products whose prices remain high, the prices of cotton dolls are often very affordable. Some &quot;non-attributed&quot; cotton dolls cost between tens of yuan and a hundred yuan, and baby clothes will be more expensive, but &quot;baby mothers&quot; can also buy their own fabrics and DIY, which is the fun of many &quot;baby mothers&quot;. The popular healing system has contributed to the further popularity of cotton dolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/EUBdRoG12f2usOU3EaPTW5rC8JcQQXcw191ZHCjB.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/EUBdRoG12f2usOU3EaPTW5rC8JcQQXcw191ZHCjB.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254711&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Specialization is the way out&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to industries such as blind boxes and figures, the market space for cotton dolls has yet to be Dig further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The current cotton doll track is mainly divided into two types: &quot;with attributes&quot; and &quot;without attributes&quot;. The new trend in the &quot;attributed&quot; track is that more and more regular troops are joining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Previously, many &quot;attributed&quot; cotton dolls were privately created &quot;secondary creations&quot; by fans, wandering on the boundary of infringement, such as not directly saying that they were infringement. A certain star or an image in a play is the prototype, but the fan base knows that it is the prototype. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nowadays, many film and television producers take the initiative to use cotton dolls as part of their derivatives, officially producing cotton dolls with &quot;attributes&quot; for sale to the public. Not only new IPs have launched Cotton Dolls, such as the previous &quot;Shanhe Ling&quot;, &quot;You Fei&quot;, &quot;Canglan Jue&quot;, &quot;Menghualu&quot;, &quot;Hunting Crime Illustrated Book&quot;, etc., some old IPs have also come to share the pie, such as &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot; &quot;&quot;Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the emerging market of cotton dolls, this kind of formalization is necessary. It can not only expand the circle, but also help to mature the cotton doll industry chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently, &quot;attributeless&quot; cotton dolls are still the mainstream, and their business model is mainly &quot;DIY design + spontaneous group building + small amount of customization&quot;, which is essentially Small workshop model. The top priority of this model is to improve the specialization of every link in the cotton doll industry chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Small workshop does not mean shoddy manufacturing and petty fuss. For cotton dolls that emphasize individuality, &quot;small workshop&quot; is an integral part of it. kind of ecology. However, cotton dolls can be &quot;niche&quot;, but the design of cotton dolls, the production of dolls, and the production of baby clothes should all be more professional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past, many cotton dolls made in a group style were of poor quality, rough details, and incorrect goods, etc. This would discourage &quot;baby mothers&quot; enthusiasm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;my country is the largest toy producer in the world, and its toy production capacity goes without saying. It is hoped that some large toy manufacturers can intervene in the cotton doll market and provide professional, standardized and systematic cotton doll customization services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The toy market is already a red ocean of competition. Cotton dolls may be a new blue ocean, it depends on who can seize the opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国籍女子在美酒驾致人死亡：死者在国内的父母如何伸张正义？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258921]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a piece of news that &quot;a Chinese woman died while driving drunk and speeding in the United States&quot; has attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Jimu News, this incident occurred in Bellevue, Washington, USA. The woman involved and the man killed are both Chinese citizens. After the incident, the woman involved refused to provide any information related to the deceased to the local police in the United States. She was also charged with vehicular homicide. Friends of the deceased told reporters that the woman involved concealed the incident from them, resulting in them not knowing that the deceased had been killed for many days. Not only that, the woman involved was suspected to have returned to the country before the US police issued an arrest warrant on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on U.S. media reports, local court indictments, and information released by the deceased’s former friends in the United States, a timeline of this case can be established. At 3:45 a.m. on September 30, the woman in question drove a Porsche 911 drunk and hit a concrete guardrail in Bellevue at a speed of 90 miles (144.84 kilometers per hour). The vehicle rolled over and was damaged. The man in the passenger seat died at the scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the police and firefighters arrived at the scene at 4:10 a.m., the woman involved refused to disclose any information about the deceased, and there was a &quot;strong smell of alcohol in her breath and speech.&quot; Since the woman involved also suffered minor injuries, she first went to the hospital for treatment and took an alcohol blood test three hours later. The police investigated the case in the following days. The local court issued an indictment on October 6, accusing the woman of &quot;driving to kill&quot;, and the police also issued an arrest warrant on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the deceased’s former friends, they discovered on October 13 that the woman in question had left Seattle before the U.S. police issued an arrest warrant and was suspected of having returned to China. WeChat chat records show that the woman involved first said, &quot;Go to the police station and ask, I can&#39;t contact him&quot; and &quot;Are you telling the truth?&quot;, and then said, &quot;It&#39;s really okay, he is safe now&quot;; finally After the death was confirmed, he said, &quot;His family should know the truth,&quot; &quot;I want to return to China to find his parents,&quot; and &quot;I was seriously injured and need to return to China to rest.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The facts that can be determined in the entire case are: the woman involved was drunk and speeding, causing the death of the man in the passenger seat; the woman involved concealed the death information of the deceased after the incident; the woman involved did not arrive at the scene He has lost contact with the case and is suspected to have returned to China. At the same time, he has deleted all the content on social media. Facts that are still unclear in the case include: what is the relationship between the deceased and the woman involved; whether the deceased knew about the woman&#39;s drunk driving in advance; whether the deceased himself was drunk, and how did he get into the car? This will all affect the distribution of accident liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the indictment in the King County Superior Court of Washington State, the woman involved needs to pay a bail of up to 2 million US dollars, and her passport should be confiscated. If the woman in question has indeed returned to the country, then she should have taken advantage of the gap in the police investigation to return to the country with her passport before the arrest warrant was issued. Without paying bail, there was a time lag with the police and an information gap with the deceased&#39;s friends. , completed the &quot;run away with a bucket&quot; in a short period of time, which is also consistent with the information spread online that the woman involved &quot;continues to report that she is safe on social media.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, the WeChat conversations between the woman involved and the deceased’s friend were also contradictory. She said, &quot;I want to go back to China to find his parents,&quot; and in a follow-up conversation, &quot;If you have the ability, you can go back to China and tell his parents this in person, or you can give his parents my contact information. This is the best way.&quot; &quot;In this case. Judging from this, the woman involved should not have taken the initiative to contact the parents and friends of the deceased in the days after the incident. Then, the statements of &quot;he was seriously injured&quot;, &quot;needs to return to China to rest&quot;, and &quot;find the parents of the deceased&quot; are probably untenable. It is inevitable that people will suspect that they are to cooperate with the real purpose of &quot;buying time to avoid arrest and return to China as soon as possible to protect themselves&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the woman did violated moral standards and violated the laws of both China and the United States. Drunk driving requires criminal liability. The criminal code of Washington State shows that &quot;driving to kill&quot; is a Class A felony, with the maximum penalty being life imprisonment and a fine of $80,000; Article 133 of the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;violation of traffic and transportation management regulations, resulting in a major If an accident causes serious injury or death to a person or causes heavy losses to public or private property, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is not the first case of &quot;committing crimes in the United States and then escaping back to the country.&quot; In the 2015 &quot;Case of Murder of a Chinese Girl Studying in the United States&quot;, the suspect fled back to the country right after the incident, but the Chinese and American police brought the suspect to justice in accordance with the &quot;China-U.S. Criminal Judicial Assistance Agreement.&quot; The circumstances of this case are different. Judging from the current situation, even if the parents of the deceased initiate a criminal private prosecution in China, they will still face a series of difficulties in evidence collection procedures, case determination, and accident liability division. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, the woman involved refused to provide any information about the deceased to the police after the incident and did not make efforts to deal with the aftermath, which was unkind; she concealed information about the deceased’s death from the circle of relatives and friends of the deceased, and even created “ &quot;It&#39;s very safe&quot; and pretending not to know is unjust; it is illegal to create a time difference and information gap through technology and use it to fly back to the country to evade charges. No matter from the perspective of emotion, reason, or law, the woman involved could get away with it so easily, which undermines fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the parents of the deceased have the right to continue criminal private prosecution, strive to continue to seek public relief under the framework of the &quot;China-US Criminal Judicial Assistance Agreement&quot;, and give justice to the deceased. It is also necessary for the public sector to take action to pursue the legal responsibility of the woman involved based on the personal principle, so as to prevent the perpetrators from going unpunished and maintain social fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[尽管发生尴尬的偷窃事件，南阳真的很想让音乐节留下]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259039]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/20/zt64JEq393bR8kyisbmEvvuKcVh5qdtjrZnlCZaN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/zt64JEq393bR8kyisbmEvvuKcV h5qdtjrZnlCZaN. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254768&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2023, the venue was muddy due to rain, and staff were on the ground Planks were laid &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Trouble&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Positioning To the &quot;Green Field Monologue&quot;, the taxi passed through Huangshan Village and stopped steadily at the entrance of a muddy open space.

In the past, &quot;this land was expropriated by the government, and some rent was paid every year. It has always been in a state of neglect.&quot; Aunt Yu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August, Nanyang Wolong District signed an industry-wide strategic cooperation agreement with Midi Music School. Public reports indicate that the two parties will carry out all-round and in-depth cooperation starting from the holding of the 2023 Central Plains Midi Music Festival. Zhang Fan said in an interview, &quot;The fate between Midi and Nanyang began four years ago. During this period, the two parties had many exchanges to discuss cooperation. After three visits, this Midi Music Festival named &#39;Zhongyuan&#39; , with the sincere efforts of both parties, settled at the foot of Dushan Mountain and on the bank of Baihe River.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10 /20/9RQnIPsAdw5UH23l9Od949RqPptQEH6G69AsZgSo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/9RQnIPsAdw5UH23l9Od949RqPptQEH6 G69AsZgSo.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;254771&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the camping area, for privacy reasons, surveillance is only installed at the entrance and exit&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Jiawei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the opening of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, Nanyang held a special preparatory meeting. At the meeting, Nanyang Municipal Party Committee Secretary Zhu Shixi pointed out that efforts should be made to make the Zhongyuan Midi Music Festival a city card that shows the image of Nanyang, a cultural feast that promotes the upgrading of cultural tourism, and achieve the goal of &quot;running a good music festival and activating a city.&quot; , the goal of making a city famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve this goal, the preparatory work will particularly emphasize: &quot;Learn from the experience and practices of Zibo Barbecue Out of the Circle, mobilize all walks of life and the general public to fully develop the sense of &#39;ownership&#39;, actively participate, proactively serve, and sincerely Hospitality, fully publicize and display the good image of Nanyang people&#39;s enthusiasm, kindness, civilization and hospitality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to welcome music fans from all over the city, promotional slogans related to the Midi Music Festival are posted throughout the city, such as &quot;Do A good music festival, a good host.” Some of them had not been demolished until ten days after the festival ended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Chang is a volunteer at the Media Center of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival. He started participating in the Midi Music Festival ten years ago. In her experience, Midi started &quot;going north&quot; in 2019. She took this opportunity to visit cities such as Binzhou and Chongli that she would not usually visit when traveling. She has traveled to many places, but she has never seen a city as hardworking as Nanyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Chang arrived in Nanyang on September 28th earlier than the average music fan. Later, I heard from a friend that &quot;the mayor and the secretary of the municipal party committee personally went to the train station to greet the music fans on the 29th and gave out a large gift package.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first day of the music festival was the Mid-Autumn Festival. After the performance, as a volunteer, she also received mooncakes from the local area. In places where traffic is restricted, the local government provides free shuttle buses for music fans to ride until the early morning. After work every night, she would take a shuttle bus and then take a taxi back to the hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“They actually welcome (music fans). We wear muddy rain boots every day to take a taxi, and the driver doesn’t mind. There is also a special rain boots rinse for music fans at the entrance of the hotel where Midi staff stays. water gun.&quot; During his few days in Nanyang, the locals left a rustic impression on Liu Chang. Anti-riot iron horses separated the music festival site from nearby residential areas. Some villagers watched the performance with great interest on the second floor of their homes. On the iron horse, she saw a hole dug into some cloth with the word &quot;Midi&quot; printed on it. &quot;They were very curious.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/20/Xp9noKj9t19PWD8l4SRvf39Salic0kliIkDE8hyX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1707&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/20/Xp9noKj9t19PWD8l4SRvf39Salic0kliIkDE8hyX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254772&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the day Liu Chang left Nanyang, he saw it at the high-speed rail station Local volunteers held a banner to say goodbye &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Fangfang, the lead singer of the Laughing Band, has never been on the shuttle car, but she was still shocked by the battle at the end of the performance. &quot;It seemed like all the buses in Nanyang were sent.&quot; After the performance on the Mid-Autumn Festival, she returned to the hotel and found that her underwear and pantyhose had been washed by the staff. , and attached a note: &quot;Please forgive me if I am offended.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fangfang, whose ancestral home is Nanyang, performed in her hometown for the first time. &quot;The whole city is working very hard and wants to leave a good impression on everyone who comes here. I especially understand their mentality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Mud Flute&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Central Plains Midi The music festival first became a trending topic because of a widely circulated photo: Music fans lifted Dong Yu, a boy in a wheelchair, to watch a performance in the rain. People say this is rock and roll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of the rain, the four-day music festival was nicknamed the &quot;Mud Flute&quot;, but this is not the first time the Midi Music Festival has encountered rainy days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, the Midi Music Festival held in Zhenjiang also had a particularly bad venue due to rain. &quot;But it was not as bad as this time. It was indeed a bit difficult this time.&quot; Music practitioner Chen Xiaobei recalled. &quot;Everyone had a great time in Zhenjiang last time. More than ten years later, we had another mud play experience, and it was in a worse environment. Everyone had a great time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first original creation in China Music Festival, Midi has gone through 23 years, and Midi Music School was established even earlier. “The establishment of Midi Music School in 1993 provided professional knowledge and a river of convergence for young people who love rock music across the country. Opportunity; on the afternoon of April 30, 2000, the Trojan Band headed towards the first bass wave in the history of Midi Music Festival; since 2007, Midi began to share its experience in organizing music festivals and participated in many new brands of music In 2009, the Midi Music Festival left Beijing for the first time and headed south.&quot; Chen Xiaobei once wrote an article recording the exciting past thirty years of Midi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/uYIxLzVcNS0702O5joA6cWy9xO12wVD9rBOgT7nS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/uYIxLzVcNS0702O5joA6cWy9xO12wVD9rBOgT7nS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254773&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sheep pass by the festival&#39;s iconic graffitied jug. To this day, many locals still come to take photos and check in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Jiawei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the theft incident, Liu Chang felt that many people followed Chen Xiaobei thought the same thing, &quot;It&#39;s fun even if you step in the mud.&quot; On the morning of October 3, she heard from her team member momo that three tents were missing. &quot;I was quite nervous, but at the time I didn&#39;t think it was a theft. I thought Maybe someone took it by mistake.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Missing along with the tent was Momo&#39;s suitcase. She later found it at the edge of a path in the venue. “It was opened, and there were a few hats, Midi posters, and power strips missing. Because I had always carried valuables with me, there were no A lot of property was lost.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When doing the finishing work that day, momo called an aunt riding a tricycle to help, &quot;She has been carrying some suitcases, maybe she wants to keep them for herself, but those boxes It belongs to our group, so I told her that it belongs to me, don’t move it around.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Exactly like the official report, Li Wei’s power bank was lost in the camping area. It rained all day on October 1 and the temperature dropped. Li Wei and his friends spent the night in the car. When he returned to the camp the next day, he found that not only his belongings were missing, but even his tent was gone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/zOY6niv2rnBveWiFEB5EuEeZYvXA0l9JyJ70XXvL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/zOY6niv2rnBveWiFEB5EuEeZYvXA0l9JyJ70XXvL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254774&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;During the music festival, staff rested on explosion-proof iron horses&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;On October 12, we contacted Qiang Chen, the person in charge of the Midi Music Festival. He said on the phone that he had heard that someone’s things had been stolen since the evening of October 2. “Mainly in the camping area. Lord.&quot; They and Nanyang police launched an emergency plan on the morning of the 3rd to conduct a special investigation, and started to compensate on the 5th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wolong Media released a message on the evening of the 5th, saying, &quot;According to the current registration situation of music fans, 79 ID cards, 3 computers, and 17 mobile phones have been returned, and the remaining items are being verified and contacted.&quot; &quot;At present, Le The compensation rate for lost property reaches 90%,&quot; Qiang Chen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wei called the police on the day he lost his belongings. Fifteen minutes later, he received a call from the police, asking him what he had lost and how much it was worth, and advising him not to worry. A few days later, he received another call from Midi staff, asking him about the brand and picture of the lost power bank, and introducing the specific compensation mechanism. “Then let those of us who lost things tell each other about the current compensation measures.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From beginning to end, Li Wei received a total of three calls about compensation. &quot;Their attitude was also very sincere.&quot; Later, he received a Midi inflatable sofa as compensation. In a &quot;Music Festival Lost Items&quot; WeChat group composed of three to four hundred people, Li Wei saw that some people had received Midi&#39;s bracelets, towels, mooncakes and other souvenirs. Everyone was very satisfied with this way of handling the matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some voices of loss, such as Liu Qifan who lost all his luggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;All he had left was his clothes, his watch, and his mobile phone.&quot; Without the help of his friends, it was hard for Liu Qifan to imagine how he would return home. Since October 3, he has recalled the things he lost too many times, “a black leather bag, a commemorative hoodie from Hamifa, a commemorative T-shirt from Midi in Central Plains, a volunteer T-shirt from Hailar, a postcard handwritten by a friend, Identity cards, bank cards, medicine for rhinitis...&quot; For him, what is more important are those items whose value cannot be measured by money. &quot;Memories cannot be bought.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/49Vn0QDjm7k7DFVjCa5HVjYhG4GgtSxIYFnzyKQk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/49Vn0QDjm7k7DFVjCa5HVjYhG4GgtSxIYFnzyKQk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254775&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;The stage being demolished&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Jiawei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Qifan also called the police. When he received a call from Midi’s official statistics on the value of lost items, he said that he had lost something worth 5,000 yuan. “As long as I can compensate you 3,500 yuan, that’s enough.” The other party replied, “The amount needs to be submitted for approval before it will be released.” Later. 3,500 yuan was compressed to 3,000 yuan, and then to 2,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few days, Liu Qifan has called the Nanyang mayor’s hotline and received several calls from the local government and Midi, but has never received compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of his friends lost his camera, cosmetic bag and other items at the scene. The camera was later recovered, but the memory card was missing. Because of this incident, my friend still stays in Nanyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up this music festival, Qiang Chen believed, “On the one hand, after four days of intense work, the staff relaxed their security work at the end. On the other hand, this incident also gave us警示，应该加大对乐迷与音乐节附近的居民在法律意识方面的宣传。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月3日，迷笛曾就偷盗事件发布公告，后来“因为评论区有大量黑河南、黑南阳的言论”又删除。 “我们不希望这件事被上升到区域的对抗。这不是我们想做的事。”羌臣说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘起帆不想地域黑。平心而论，这座城市有它温情脉脉的一面，但东西被盗的那天，他又觉得，“再不会来河南。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;蒙了灰的音乐节&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;午饭过后，黄山村静悄悄的。一个妇人在房后的空地种蒜，她的菜地里还种了青椒和萝卜，“都是自家吃的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黄山村人喜欢自给自足。村口小卖铺的货架上摆了水、饮料、瓜子和烟酒，“村里人一般习惯来这买油盐酱醋”。店铺不大，主要靠卖烟酒赚钱，“一个月下来能赚三四千。关键是开（超市的人）家太多了，有五六家。”中年男店主一边结账一边向我抱怨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与河南众多村落的命运相似，黄山村的青壮年大多外出打工去了，最近是南阳市区，远的四散各地，“去哪的都有”。等人到中年，活就不好找了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韩叔今年67岁，和老伴同在市区一个小区做绿化管理，每天洒水、打药、除草，一个月2500块，“顾着生活就行”。他的花销不大，除了买烟——“半个月就得买一条。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前几年，他一直在建筑工地监工，再早些时候，他是被监工的一方。 “干这个赚钱，但是太累了，也危险。”年纪大了后，女儿不让他干了。讲起这些时，他正在菜地里种菠菜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韩叔的菜地与于阿姨家相隔不远。向右，是静谧的村子。向左，是尘土飞扬的“绿野独白”。除了村子的入口，场地另一个入口通向孔明大道。这些天来，那个入口一直有车进进出出，或是开进场地掉个头，或是三两人下来嘻嘻哈哈打卡，又或是“单纯来瞧稀罕的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/FoWsD6mfCkot7IW7eyQZqZKOby48fdfvy0S5WDA6.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;当地人不欢迎媒体。一个在现场监工的男人向身旁来看热闹的人抱怨，“你不知道音乐节结束之后这里多少垃圾，俺如果现在不安排环卫工人在这里打扫卫生，你看吧，就有人过来拍说&#39;现场多么脏，当地已经没人管了&#39;。每天都有人想过来挖我们的黑料，没有一个人看到我们付出的努力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是许多当地人的心声。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每个跟我讲过话的当地人都说自己不清楚偷窃的人具体是谁、什么情况，但都觉得，“就是一颗老鼠屎，坏了整锅粥。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个村民试图向我解释偷盗事件发生的原因——“这是俺们这第一次办音乐节，大家对于它是干啥的都不是很清楚；要是安保工作再延长半天就好了，人太多了，根本顾不住。而且确实有乐迷说自己走了，东西不要了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈小北觉得这并非依靠安保能解决的。 “当然，目前安保做得不够好，但即使修了两米或者五米高的围墙，要配多少保安才能盯住所有人？网上的一部分苛责对他们来说太难了，也不现实。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“不管是什么音乐节，丢东西都是大概率发生的。”羌臣过去参与的一场音乐节曾遭遇过一个盗窃团伙，“当时丢的手机数量非常多，总价值可能与这次迷笛的损失差不多。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘畅记得，2022年参加苏州迷笛音乐节的时候，最后散场也是有人去“捡垃圾”。她当时的一名组员因为出言劝阻，后来做了领队。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次音乐节，刘畅认识的一对夫妻专程赶来补拍婚纱照。两人就是在几年前的迷笛上认识的。四五天的时间里，她玩得尽兴，可等回到北京，同事都在问她东西丢了没。 “大家最后对音乐节的印象就是偷盗，没人会觉得你们玩得真好。有一层灰蒙蒙的感觉。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月19日，与志愿者多次沟通后，刘起帆收到了2000块的赔偿金，还有装着月饼、护眼贴、毛巾、迷笛手环的伴手礼。 “作为亲历者，并不好说什么满意与不满意。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中原迷笛音乐节的开幕式上，南阳市文化广电和旅游局局长曾表示，“要让迷笛音乐节在南阳扎根十年。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据南阳广播电视台报道，9月29日至10月5日，南阳共接待游客709.87万人次，实现旅游收入28.99亿元，同比增长分别为19.44%、33.29%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在现场，我问一个正在清理垃圾的大叔：还希望再办音乐节吗？他坚定地回答，“还希望办，有好处。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;羌臣向我们确认，迷笛与南阳将会长期合作。 “明年（2024年），我们仍然在南阳举办迷笛音乐。”张帆接受《南阳日报》采访时说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（除刘畅、陈小北、羌臣、芳芳外，其余均为化名。）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;宣姜是著名的美女，她是齐僖公的女儿，卫宣公的夫人，做了霸主的齐桓公是她兄弟，著名的许穆夫人则是她的女儿。她被视为红颜祸水的标本，所谓五世不宁，乱由姜起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卫宣公与庶母夷姜私通，生下儿子伋。立为太子，为他娶齐女。未成婚时，宣公听说齐女是绝色，一秒上头，花心风发作，立马了无挂碍地截胡自己收了房，为太子另娶。齐女生下儿子寿和朔。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后夷姜因失宠而自杀。作了正夫人的齐女也即宣姜，和儿子朔向宣公进谗言构陷太子。宣公不爽，于是命太子出使齐国，派人半路截杀太子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;寿将实情告知太子，劝他逃走，太子以父命不可违，没有答应。于是寿拿了太子的旗号替兄前往被杀。太子随后也到，自报当杀乃我，也被杀死。于是宣公立朔为太子。宣公死后，朔即位，是为惠公。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因惠公系谗害太子才取而代之，卫人怨恨，于是作乱，立伋弟黔牟为君，惠公出逃。后齐襄公率诸侯奉王命伐卫，黔牟逃走，惠公复立。齐襄公让宣姜改嫁伋的另一位弟弟顽，生了三子二女。而谗杀埋下的祸根并未消解，卫国的内乱依然此起彼伏。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“AI已经击垮了亚马逊。”林奇在推文中这样写道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据8月《纽约时报》报道，旅游指南也成为AI书籍泛滥的主要类别之一。3月，旅行者艾米·科尔斯基为即将到来的法国之旅在亚马逊上购买旅行指南。当她输入几个搜索关键词“旅行”“指南”“法国”后，一本排名靠前的《法国旅游指南》引起了她的注意。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据作者页面显示，该书作者迈克·史蒂夫斯是一位“著名的旅行作家”。书籍的界面上有一百多个五星好评，该指南还承诺有行程安排和当地人的推荐。于是，艾米·科尔斯基下了单。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;令她失望的是，收到书籍后，她发现里面的描述模糊、文字重复，并且缺乏行程安排，看起来像是从维基百科上复制粘贴的。她将这本书退回了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《纽约时报》发现事情并不简单。他们无法找到该书所谓的“作者”之前发表的任何作品，甚至界面上“作者”的照片也显得奇怪，比如耳朵附近存在的异常元素、歪歪扭扭的衣服等，看起来是由AI生成的照片。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据AI检测工具Originality.ai的结果，几乎可以肯定迈克·史蒂夫斯的书AI生成。此外，《纽约时报》发现，AI生成的书籍也开始渗透到烹饪、编程、医学、园艺等许多类别中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在许多媒体的报道中，AI生成的书籍不仅给读者带来误导信息，也给真人作者造成了极大的困扰。8月，作家简·弗里德曼在自己的博客上称，有一些“垃圾书”被上传到亚马逊上，作者一栏赫然写着她的名字，但她并没有写过这些书，它们极大可能是AI生成的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从2009年开始，她一直在写博客，很多内容都是公开的，可以用于AI的模型训练。因此，当她读到这些“假书”的第一页时，就像在阅读自己生成的ChatGPT回复一样。更让她觉得雪上加霜的是，这些“假书”被添加到她的Goodreads个人资料中，这很容易引起误导。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她在社交平台上抱怨这件事情之后，一些作者回应称，他们也有过类似的经历。“人们一直告诉我他们买了我的新书，上面有我的名字，但我从未写过。”一位作者说。还有的作者仅仅一周就举报了29本类似情况的书籍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“可怕的是，这种情况可能发生在任何一个有名声、有地位、有需求的人身上，有人看到了从中获利的途径。”在接受美国有线电视新闻网采访时，简·弗里德曼说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“实际上是在允许&#39;垃圾书&#39;的存在”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在罗里发现有关他的传记是AI生成的内容后，亚马逊给他发了一封电子邮件，上面推荐说，“你可能会喜欢这本书”。这让罗里感到生气，亚马逊的算法竟认为这是一本他想要的书。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他们实际上是在允许&#39;垃圾书&#39;的存在，还把它推荐给最讨厌它的人。”罗里告诉《卫报》。尽管亚马逊之后删除了这本书，但还是有很多作品通过了旨在剔除低质量图书的过滤系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，许多AI生成的书籍出现在亚马逊平台上，跟它本身的自助出版系统KDP（Kindle Direct Publishing）被滥用有很大关系。2007年，亚马逊创建KDP，允许任何人在亚马逊上自行出版和销售书籍。目前，它可以提供超过45种语言选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在亚马逊KDP平台，作者可以自由选择自助出版电子书或纸质书，完成自助出版书籍的上传流程后，亚马逊大约72小时内就能通过审核并进行销售。在此平台上自助出版书籍是免费的，不过，如果出版纸质书，印刷成本会从每本书销售所得的版税中扣除。一般来说，作者可获得的纸质书版税最高为60%，电子书的版税为35%或70%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另外，随着人工智能技术的发展，在YouTube、TikTok等平台上，许多利用AI生成书籍的教程也纷纷出现，其主题范围广泛，不少用户可以从中快速掌握AI生成书籍的方法，再加上亚马逊自助出版功能的便利与收益，滥用此功能进行AI书籍出版和销售的行为也很难避免。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在接到许多作者的投诉后，9月，亚马逊在其KDP的社区页面上引入了新的规则和指南。新规要求作者在发布作品时，回答系统关于作品是否为人工智能生成的提问。在其内容指南部分，亚马逊也增加了有关AI的内容，包括对“人工智能生成”和“人工智能辅助”的定义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《卫报》报道，出于对人工智能的担忧，亚马逊推出限制自助出版者每日最多发布3本书的新规。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但即使新规已经发布，有些影响却已造成。简·弗里德曼的相关事件发酵后，那些假冒她之名的书籍从亚马逊和她的Goodreads个人资料中被删去。但这一过程并不顺利，亚马逊一开始拒绝停止出售那些书籍。简·弗里德曼认为，最终是由于她在写作和出版界的知名度和声誉才促使亚马逊撤下那些书。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“现在亚马逊上发布的人工智能内容泛滥成灾，有时还以误导或欺诈的方式归属于作者，怎么能理所当然地指望在职作者在余生中每周都花时间来监管这些内容呢？”她发出质问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而即使那些书不再出现在她的亚马逊或Goodreads页面上，它们的影响仍然存在。简·弗里德曼在自己的博客上写道：“不幸的是，即使你把这些疯狂的书从你的官方资料中删除了，它们仍然会和你的名字在一起……而你对此却无能为力。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;在经济学领域，有一个著名的“蒙代尔不可能三角”。这一理论是说，国家在货币政策的独立性、汇率的稳定性和资本的自由流动这三者之间无法同时满足，最多只能选择其中两个。同理，在就业市场上，我认为也存在着一个类似的“不可能三角”定律。它涉及一个工作岗位的薪资水平、工作平台和相对稳定性这三个条件，很难同时实现，最多只能满足其中两个。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我来简要介绍一下这位朋友的基本情况：小言来自西北某省会的农村家庭，本科毕业于211高校，博士毕业于北京知名985高校，成绩非常优异；求学期间发表多篇SCI论文，参与多个国家级课题，获得了不少高级别大赛的奖项。他拿到的三个offer各自具备明确的特点。第一个工作是国家部委事业编，有户口，工作平台好，社会地位相对较高，但收入水平在北京这样的一线城市，除去开支可能所剩无几，面对高昂的房价，他心有余而力不足；第二份工作属于行业垄断性事业单位，既有编制，收入也有保证，但平台一般，后期跳槽受限制较多；第三份工作是家乡211高校，科研平台水平较高，学科实力雄厚，工作时间也相对自由，美中不足的是，随着高校事业单位改革，这份工作没有编制且聘期考核压力较大，他担心未来面临非升即走的结局。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管小言最终的选择尚未确定，但我建议他在寻找工作时，首要任务是学会降低对某一特定因素的预期，而不是陷入“我全都要”的境地。仅就这三份工作而言，如果他青睐体制内稳定的工作环境，那或许应该对薪水降低一些预期，第一份工作可能是不二之选；如果他追求更好的薪水待遇，就需要对工作平台的要求有所妥协，这样第二份工作可能更合适一些；如果向往更好的科研平台，有志于学术发展，小言可以试着对编制这个指标看淡一些，挑战一下第三份高校教职也不错。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，月亮有阴晴圆缺，工作也有美中不足，此事古难全。对于大多数毕业的大学生来说，找到的工作基本符合“不可能三角”定律，因此，必要的时候需要我们找准需求，学会取舍，才能少一分焦虑，坦然面对严峻的就业环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者系2023年应届博士毕业生）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;松尾芭蕉行至松岛时曾面海而居。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（作者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;继续再往北走，经过秋田，进入青森。铁路沿线上尽是正在丰收期的苹果园，有些地段，缀满红果的枝叶就在手边擦过，中间隔着列车的玻璃窗。那种惊喜实在是相当强烈的。真正摸到苹果，得在车站超市里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;青森的苹果产量占日本全国产量的一半，是世界闻名的富士苹果的发祥地，另有二三十种其他品种的苹果。青森培育出的“世界第一”苹果，一个在500克以上，有的可以达到1000克甚至1500克。我们在超市逛的时候看到那些青森苹果也堪称巨型，一个一个地卖，一个500日元左右，折合人民币三十元左右。贵是贵点，但汁水丰沛味道甜美。我们三个人在一个小站转车时买了一个分食，居然都吃饱了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在青森，当然有目的地——去金木看太宰治的故居“斜阳馆”，另外还去了十和田，参观著名的十和田美术馆。至于说芭蕉行迹，得在这一圈周转之后进入到一个高潮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们掉头从北到南，从青森坐车至仙台，转在来线至松岛海岸驿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;芭蕉句吟：“松岛夏月夜碧水为衣裳”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;芭蕉和曾良的奥州之行，他说，这一趟旅行，纯属心血来潮之举，于是也顾不得吴天白发之恨了。这个心血来潮，在他开篇序言里说了，因为松岛之月呈现在他的心里，诱他上路。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴天白发，典出白居易“去年九日到东洛，今年九日来吴乡。两边蓬鬓一时白，三处菊花同色黄”和宋人魏庆之的诗句“笠重吴天雪，鞋香楚地花”，都意指旅途遥远艰辛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/jZeCav7eKr5CrSenYdxKPRvuuJUexS5tydhfHScY.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;松岛位于日本东北宫城县宫城郡，是松尾芭蕉行迹“歌枕”中的名胜，因群岛上遍植松树而得名。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（作者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;松岛，因遍植松树而得名。古代日本传统色名有松叶色一说，顾名思义，松叶的颜色，这是一种四季常绿的深绿色。在日本传统色中，还有好几种跟松叶相关的颜色，有海松色，是接近黑色的绿；有海松茶色，深绿中掺杂了褐黄，是一种沉着俏丽的绿。再有就是海松蓝、黄海松茶、蓝海松茶等等，在我看来就是松叶色的各种衍生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《奥之细道》中，芭蕉时不时会注明走到了某一处“歌枕”。 “歌枕”一词的意思是自古以来出现在日本和歌中的名胜之地。日本的歌枕之巅，有三景之说，天桥立、松岛和严岛（也叫做宫岛）。这三大景点早在江户早期就很有名了。对于我来说，松岛因为芭蕉在《奥之细道》中的描述，感觉文气更甚。芭蕉的“失语”特别有趣，他嚷嚷道，“松岛呀！啊！啊！松岛呀！松岛呀！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/7ApEi9HKrHnqZ1Pl4VExcQcLavIICeH0KLTKSTjH.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;瑞岩寺的枯山水庭院。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（作者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;松岛在日本东北宫城县宫城郡，是海湾内的岛群，由大大小小260个小岛组成，因遍植黑松和红松，故名。此地四颜是碧浪、白砂、灰岩、青松，色彩相当明朗协调。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年10月30日那天，我和卫东、艳宁，从青森的八户启程前往松岛。从八户驿坐到仙台，转在来线至松岛海岸驿。很小的车站站台，立于铁道中间，夜晚到达，已具凛冽之意的寒风从站台的四面围逼过来。毕竟已经是秋天了，白日的阳光煦暖，到了晚上就溃败而去。我们赶紧坐上酒店和车站之间的来往班车，转过一个坡，就到了酒店“大观庄”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一座趴着的长方形大体量的楼体，巨大的大堂向楼体两端延伸。这种大规模的度假酒店几乎是一模一样的，在箱根，在北海道，都有。我高度怀疑是一个设计师做的。看到这种规模的酒店，就知道松岛的热门程度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;夜入松岛，看不到什么。清晨起来拉开窗帘，一百八十度的海景景观就在眼前。确实美貌。清冽端素的那种美貌，适合芭蕉这种精神状态清淡枯寂的人。芭蕉在松岛也是面海而居，住处在二楼（我们住的比他更高，三楼），他说，“开窗面海，所谓旅卧风云中，奇妙之感，不可言宣。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我随身带着《奥之细道》。到了松岛，就把书中关于“松岛”的那一章节仔细地又读了一遍。芭蕉叹道，“夫古老相传，松岛风景，扶桑第一，盖不逊于洞庭、西湖也。自东南纳海入湾，湾内三里，汹涌如浙江潮。大岛小岛无数，耸立者直指天外，俯伏者匍匐波上。或二层重叠，或三层堆砌；左右诸岛，或离或连；有负者，有抱者，如爱儿孙然。苍松郁郁，潮打风吹，枝叶虬曲，自然而然，而若矫揉之所致。其景窅然，有美人凝妆之貌。岂古昔神代大山祇之所为哉？造化天工，孰能奋其彩笔，以尽其妙乎？”（郑清茂译）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;芭蕉没有到过中国，但借用中国之景，并不勉强。古代日本文人通过对汉语典籍和绘画作品的阅读，对西湖、洞庭湖、钱江潮之类的中国胜景，也有相当的熟悉和亲近，信手拈来，比赋眼前美景，以解词穷之困，是顺理成章的事情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年冬天，我和同行友人在富良野参观了后藤纯男美术馆。我依稀记得他好像有一幅画松岛的，还是一幅很长的画。我记得我拍了的（特别说明一下，日本很多的美术馆是不能拍展品的，或者只能拍部分展品。我是严格遵守这一规定的。后藤纯男美术馆的所有展品都允许拍照）。 2019年11月，从奥州之行回家之后打开电脑查看，我找出了这幅画，非常惊讶，这不就是我们在大观庄的房间看出去的景色吗？我觉得后藤纯男造访松岛的时候，就是住的大观庄，而且就是我们那一排面海的三楼房间的其中一间。后藤纯男的这幅画作于1987年，叫做《松岛之晨》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ud8QPlbfKJzhSCfAI3lRj04aLAniveD7G2jmoqTK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ud8QPlbfKJzhSCfAI3lRj04aLAniveD7G2jmoqTK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254356&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;瑞岩寺的附寺圆通院的红叶。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（作者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时，清晨站在窗前看着眼前的松岛海景，想起日本文化随笔作家白州正子的一段话，她说，“日本是东方的一座孤岛，好坏都在&#39;孤&#39;字上。这座孤岛就像世界文化的风积角落，无论是什么，只要经过日本人之手，就会变身为一种更难以言说的、精巧的、密度更大的东西”。我认同这种说法。文化形态没有明确的高下判断，但有着节奏、速度、质感完全不同的区别。日本文化是世界文化加以凝缩后的呈现，大风大浪把各种文化输送到这个远东的岛国，也就到此为止，然后加以剔除转化后，凝结为晶体化的一种文化形态。它的静态和密度，跟大陆文化和走廊文化是完全不同的。风与浪止于此，但风与浪都凝结其中，仿佛天地间的一滴琥珀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在窗前看松岛的风景，我突然想起这些。在旅途中，一般情况下，抽象的文字会继续刺激我的思考，而视觉上的优美，则会让我相当涣散。松岛是个例外。看来，确实是不一般的松岛啊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《奥之细道》里，芭蕉的随从门人曾良吟了一首俳句，“猗欤松岛，杜鹃应借鹤身，唱遍全湾。”这首俳句刻成了句碑，立在了瑞岩寺的门口，跟“芭蕉碑”并置在一起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;松岛的核心是瑞岩寺。芭蕉和曾良是在夏天造访瑞岩寺的，想来满目清幽。我们仲秋到达，清幽残存，秋意的些微黄红之妙掺夹其间。天空的气息肯定是完全不一样了。四季的天空真是奇妙，同样的清朗高远，但秋空就是更为深远杳渺，犹如眼窝更深的一双眼睛，跟其他三个季节不一样。从仙台车站开始就看到一路张贴的松岛红叶旅游宣传海报，红得铺天盖地。海报选取的就是瑞岩寺红叶，准确地说，是瑞岩寺的附寺圆通院的红叶。圆通院的庭院迂回婉转，是一个专门为秋天准备的庭院，遍植枫树，到了深秋就会殷红一片。我们到的时候是个什么景象呢？拿马拉松比赛作比吧，红枫的发令枪已经响了，前面已经冲出去了一些选手，但庞大的队伍还在起跑处。想象我们前脚刚走，圆通院的红叶就会大规模狂跑起来，直至成满园燃烧之势，要说没有一点怅然是不可能的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;瑞岩寺是临济宗的重要寺院，建于公元828年，寺内有明治天皇曾经下榻过的房间，专门标注出来。沿着游览路线在本堂、回廊游走一番后，我的注意力还是放在了庭园。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秋光一旦沉淀下来，是灰蓝色的。尤其是在上午。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从松岛回来之后，我经常把瑞岩寺枯山水庭院的照片翻出来看。被光线分隔出的奇妙光景，阴影处，白砂变成了清透的灰蓝色，砂纹的皱褶里蕴藏细小的风雷，深浅两色的苔藓有着奇妙的玲珑感。越过阴影，强光中，白壁和山岩，与寺外从山崖上连绵而下的松树，以那簇红叶为界限，在此卸掉了角力的势态，静了下来。但这种静止似乎随时都可以打破，如果光线稍微有点变化的话。于是，看的人不由自主屏住了呼吸。所以，定格成照片是对的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;艺术哲学家亚瑟·丹托教授对芭蕉很有研究，认为芭蕉俳句的质地“安静、简洁、如钻石般晶莹清冷”。他曾经也说过，想成为芭蕉那样的人。芭蕉的旅行是对艺术、自然和内心的朝圣，他诙谐、自嘲，骄傲且孤独，但有着浓厚的谦卑之心，对先辈、对自然、对用双脚叩击地面的这个行为的本身，他都有十分虔诚的意念。他的修行已经在修行的过程中圆满完成。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;丹托教授有一段话说得好，他说，“……芭蕉作为一个个体，存在于这样一个个性彰显和个性泯灭相统一的现实之中，既不算入世，也没那么出世；如他自嘲的那样，他就像是一只蝙蝠，既非鼠也非鸟，而是一种处在两种动物生存状态之间的杂交变形生物。我总为他的游记所打动。这些游记，是他体内焦躁不安之感的象征。他总是从感觉或是从对终结的希望出发，无意于回归，以寻求某种终极的逃离，到头来发现，逃离本身就是成就。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于芭蕉，我曾经说，视他为文学上的情人。或者可以说，我想成为他那样的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
