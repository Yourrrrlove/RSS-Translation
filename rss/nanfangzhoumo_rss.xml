According to &quot;Dafeng News&quot;, Di, a native of Luannan, Hebei, who had been sentenced to three years in prison for rape, finally waited for a fair judgment from the court on October 10, 2023: The Tangshan Intermediate People&#39;s Court ruled that &quot;the facts are unclear and the evidence is insufficient.&quot; &quot;The original verdict was revoked and Xiao Di was found not guilty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The timeline of this case is not complicated. On February 22, 2018, a dating agency in Luannan County introduced a woman to Di. After the two met, &quot;both were quite satisfied.&quot; That night, Di invited the woman and Wang, the owner of the dating agency, to dinner. After dinner, Di drove the woman in question and invited her out to play. They had a &quot;very good chat&quot; and had sex in the car. Afterwards, Di drove the woman back to the dating agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The owner of the dating agency called Di that night and said, &quot;The woman no longer wanted to have sex after having sex&quot; and &quot;asked Di to compensate the woman with tens of thousands of yuan.&quot; In desperation, Di had no choice but to return to the dating agency and work with the boss to find the woman involved to coordinate, but they did not reach an agreement on the &quot;compensation&quot;. On the second day after the incident, Wang took two people to Di&#39;s home and formally made a &quot;compensation request&quot; of 20,000 yuan. Di thought Wang was extorting money and was unwilling to accept it. Wang called the police that day. In the next few days, Di gave Wang several thousand yuan and received the assurance from the other party that &quot;it will be fine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 1, a week after the incident, Di was detained on suspicion of rape and arrested 12 days later. On June 1, 2018, the Luannan County Procuratorate prosecuted Di for rape. On December 29 of the same year, Di was sentenced to three years in prison for rape, and his second-instance appeal was also rejected. During his sentence, Di insisted on not pleading guilty and asked to appeal. He waited until February 28, 2021, to be released after serving his sentence. After being released from prison, Di requested a retrial. After more than two years of judicial proceedings, he finally won a not guilty verdict recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case has been delayed for five years. After many twists and turns, there are still many unanswered questions about the case. A retrial should not be the end of this case. Although the parties involved have been avenged, there are still many aspects of this case that deserve further questioning and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved are suspected of extortion and should be held legally accountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you examine the case carefully, it is not difficult to see the absurdity of the &quot;rape&quot; accusation. I would like to ask, if &quot;rape&quot; really exists, can &quot;paying 20,000 yuan&quot; be exchanged for not calling the police? How is this different from prostitution? The woman involved “no longer wanted to have sex after having sex.” Could it be that the so-called “consent” could be revoked at any time afterwards? If this is the case, the evidentiary standards for rape cases handled by public prosecutors and prosecutors are too low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the client is not found guilty of rape, the behavior of the dating agency owner is an out-and-out extortion, and there are both completed and attempted circumstances. According to Article 1 of the &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Extortion&quot; promulgated by the two high authorities on April 23, 2013, extortion of public and private property worth more than 2,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan should be deemed as Article 274 of the Criminal Law The specified &quot;amount is relatively large&quot;. According to the standards of Hebei Province&#39;s two highs, the starting point for &quot;larger amounts&quot; is 3,000 yuan. In this case, the successful extortion amount by the owner of the dating agency was &quot;several thousand yuan&quot;, and the attempted extortion amount was 20,000 yuan, which fully meets the standard of &quot;large amount&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved in this case are also suspected of false accusation and frame-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the public opinion offensive of &quot;Internet essays&quot; in recent years, the false accusation method in this case can be described as simple and crude, and the case was reported directly to the public security organ. Judging from the results, the false accusation and frame-up caused the client Di to be imprisoned for three years, and it took a lot of time and energy to get justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of the parties involved in this case is undoubtedly worse than that of those &quot;victims of Internet essays&quot;. Since the false accusation has caused serious consequences for him being wrongly imprisoned, Di has more reason to obtain corresponding judicial relief. Article 243 of the Criminal Law stipulates that fabricating facts to frame others with the intention of subjecting others to criminal prosecution, if the circumstances are serious, shall constitute the crime of false accusation and frame-up. If the circumstances are serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance; if serious consequences are caused, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The client’s acquittal is only the starting point for him to seek judicial relief, and should not be the end. Di has the right to file a criminal private prosecution with the court, requesting the public authorities to hold the owner of the dating agency and Wang accountable for criminal liability, and assume the accompanying civil compensation obligations, to relieve the heavy losses he has suffered in the past five years, and to clear up the huge injustice that has been imposed on him. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the dating agency and the woman involved may have serious suspicions of &quot;fairy dancing&quot; and organizing fraud. This is also something that the police should investigate in depth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the dating agency and the woman involved showed a situation of &quot;cooperating with each other and playing tricks skillfully&quot;. The woman&#39;s words and deeds were inconsistent, and the owner of the dating agency acted as a &quot;middleman&quot; to negotiate &quot;compensation&quot; with the client. Combined with the &quot;reverent&quot; attitude of the dating agency owner, this case has been cast into layers of suspicion of fraud. The suspicion that the dating agency owner and the woman involved colluded to commit the crime cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the suspicion of collusion is established, then this case can be called a &quot;dating agency fraud&quot;. The method is more sinister and vicious than the previous marriage agencies that &quot;only seek to make money&quot;. &quot;Property&quot; marriage fraud is more crude and direct. It can be regarded as a &quot;fairy jump fraud&quot; disguised as a matchmaking agency, and is suspected of constituting the crime of fraud. Article 266 of the Criminal Law stipulates that whoever defrauds public or private property and the amount is relatively large shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or public surveillance, and shall also or solely be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of public interest, the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved in this case also deserve to be severely punished by the law. If the result of this case is that one person, Di, is not guilty and the two are not punished, it will be tantamount to institutional incentives for similar acts of extortion, false accusations and frame-ups, leading to a situation where &quot;one will not be held responsible no matter what if the blackmail and false accusations fail.&quot; This situation is obviously not conducive to curbing similar illegal and criminal activities and puts more potential victims at risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, Di, the party involved in this case, certainly has reason to seek state compensation and compensation for the various losses caused by being wrongfully imprisoned. At the same time, he will launch a criminal private prosecution against the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved to pursue their various criminal responsibilities. They are required to fulfill their accompanying civil compensation obligations and seek justice for themselves. It is also necessary for relevant departments to intervene and conduct an in-depth investigation into the suspicion that the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved have committed gang fraud, so as to deter similar people who are lucky enough to get involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[猫狗鸟蛇……每年五十多万只动物命丧公路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258541]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/rdNvCtUMWcYoDaCM7cWfhM9jc5aX1oAK7AVNT30h.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;870&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/rdNvCtUMWcYoDaCM7cWfhM9jc5aX1 oAK7AVNT30h. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254037&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Roadkilled cat. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the research team)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blackbird (dōng), which is black all over and has a yellow beak, is a common bird in the city. It is good at imitating the calls of other birds and likes to move in the woods. Street trees and shrubs on both sides of the road provide ideal habitats for blackbirds, but they also pose fatal risks. Li Zhongqiu, a professor at the School of Life Sciences of Nanjing University, encountered blackbirds that suddenly appeared several times while driving, and almost became a &quot;murderer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Animal-vehicle collisions that result in fatal accidents are known as &quot;road kills.&quot; Nowadays, wheels have replaced shotguns as one of the main threats to animals, whether in inaccessible reserves or traffic-filled cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of animals killed on the roads is unimaginable. A research paper with Li Zhongqiu as the corresponding author was recently published in the academic journal PeerJ: More than 570,000 birds and mammals may be roadkilled in Nanjing every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been few systematic studies on road killing in China before. The study by Li Zhongqiu’s team evaluated the background data of road killing in Nanjing, a large city. &quot;Road killing is a very serious threat, but there is insufficient awareness among both the academic community and the public.&quot; Li Zhongqiu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cats, dogs, blackbirds, and sparrows are at the highest risk&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;my country’s total road mileage has reached 5.28 million kilometers, which can circle the earth more than 100 times. The transportation network extending in all directions has provided convenience for human life, but it has become a natural barrier for many wild animals. Every time you cross the road, it is like experiencing a journey of life and death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Academic research shows that 340 million birds die on the road in the United States every year, about 335,000 hedgehogs die on the road in the United Kingdom every year, and about 9 million large and medium-sized mammals die in traffic accidents in Brazil every year. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongqiu told Southern Weekend reporters that road killing is one of the research contents of the interdisciplinary &quot;road ecology&quot; and there are many academic studies in the United States, Europe and other countries. However, currently, road killing is systematically carried out in China. There are not many studies, and the existing studies are mostly conducted in protected areas and lack analysis of urban environments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2020, Li Zhongqiu’s team has carried out a one-year monitoring of 9 roads in Nanjing. These 9 roads include 3 national roads, 3 provincial roads and 3 county roads. The roadside habitats cover residential areas, farmland, mountains, waters, open lands, forests, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/jHJGDj2QDMJyU4a0y9f3ok1ynq3BEws2c2vzFxAb.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height= &quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/jHJGDj2QDMJyU4a0y9f3ok1ynq3BEws2c2vzFxAb.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254036&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A research team observes roadkill in Nanjing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(paper screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every two weeks, the researchers walked the entire route at a speed of no more than 40km/h. Record dead animals found on the road. The total mileage traveled is 5,831 kilometers, which is equivalent to the round-trip distance from Beijing to Urumqi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 26 monitoring activities, researchers found a total of 293 roadkill animals. There are 136 mammals among them, the most common ones are cats and dogs, as well as wild mammals such as weasels and hedgehogs, and a kind of reptile - the tiger-spotted snake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are 143 birds, the most common ones being blackbirds and sparrows, which is related to their large population and wide distribution. Other birds include pearl-necked doves, gray magpies, white-headed bulbuls, etc., most of which are common species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;May to July is the peak period for road killings. The number of road killings in these three months accounts for about 1/3 of the whole year. Li Zhongqiu explained that this period is the breeding season for many animals. The baby animals lack survival experience. Adult animals increase the frequency of foraging to raise their children, and the probability of road kill increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The locations where road kills occur are closely related to the animals’ habitats. For example, road sections with a high proportion of farmland, forestry and wetland areas have a higher risk of roadkill; the smaller the distance between the road and the river, the higher the risk of roadkill; roadkill is more likely to occur in areas far away from urban main roads ; Compared to curvy roads, the risk of roadkill is higher on straight roads because vehicles travel faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the model, researchers calculated the number of animals that are killed on the road in Nanjing every year - more than 110,000 mammals and more than 450,000 birds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The model is constructed based on on-site monitoring of the retention time of animal carcasses, the probability of discovery, and the composition of different roads in Nanjing. Since the carcasses of roadkill animals do not remain on the road for too long, the researchers placed frozen chicken heads and frozen whole chickens on multiple road sections to represent small and large animal carcasses respectively, monitored the retention time of the simulated carcasses on the road, and calculated the number of roadkill animals. The probability of detection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/ctOxUfPfW7fH3pxoUlBEeQxIpnJsRrjlm6UaHUNb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;303&quot; height= &quot;203&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/ctOxUfPfW7fH3pxoUlBEeQxIpnJsRrjlm6UaHUNb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254035&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Roadkilled bird. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the research team)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Common species also have important value&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to help animals reduce traffic accidents risks of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many protected areas establish ecological corridors for animal migration along transportation routes. For example, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has established 33 wildlife crossings for sheep migration, benefiting Tibetan antelopes and other wild animals; Hubei Shennongjia National Park has built a total of 25 animal crossings of three types: upper span type, lower culvert type and gentle slope type. , making it easier for Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys to cross; Yunnan Province&#39;s Si Xiao Expressway has set up bridges and tunnels for Asian elephants, and the utilization rate of 25 wildlife passages by wild Asian elephants reached 72%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ecological corridors can also be established on busy urban highways. For example, in 2020, the Paiya Mountain-Qiniang Mountain Ecological Corridor in Dapeng New District, Shenzhen was completed, connecting the two mountains and spanning the highway. It is the first animal-only overpass in Guangdong Province that was completed and put into use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff from the Dapeng Administration Bureau of the Shenzhen Municipal Planning and Natural Resources Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that in 2018, Dapeng New District conducted a survey on road deaths of wild animals. In July and August, A total of 383 road kill incidents were recorded, killing more than 40 species, mainly amphibians and reptiles such as black-orbited toads, Hong Kong newts, anoles, etc., with a small number of birds and mammals also recorded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member said that ecological corridors not only reconnect fragmented habitats, but also effectively reduce the occurrence of road kills. More than 40 infrared cameras arranged on the ecological corridor bridge have recorded that more than 60 species of animals breed, forage, and move within the ecological corridor. Wild mammals such as ocelots, wild boars, porcupines, and macaques have been recorded. A good animal habitat is formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongqiu believes that whether cities build ecological corridors should focus on cost and local species. There are also some effective methods, such as setting up signboards in roadkill hotspots to remind drivers that animals are often found here, slowing down and observing more road conditions, or setting up speed bumps, building animal fences, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongqiu admitted that the current understanding and research on road killing is still relatively rudimentary, and “it is difficult to assess the impact of road killing on the local ecosystem.” But at least from the data, road killing is The problem deserves more attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Li Zhongqiu’s team’s research on road killing is only carried out in Nanjing. He hopes that in the future, the regional scope can be expanded to a national scale to conduct more in-depth research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the animals that encounter roadkill in cities are common species, they still have a unique status in the ecosystem. Li Zhongqiu gave an example. The common bird, the white-headed bulbul, is a bit annoying in daily life - vehicles parked under the camphor trees are often attacked by the bird droppings &quot;bombs&quot; of the white-headed bulbul. But the Bald Bulbul is an important functional bird in the ecosystem, and its excrement can help plant seeds spread several kilometers away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We always focus on humans and talk about whether a species is useful to us.” Li Zhongqiu said, “Every species living on the earth has its function and value. The more common it is, the more common it is. Species, the more valuable they are, we cannot ignore them living around us just because they are common.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt; a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx. best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙卓、符建涛被拐案宣判：两名被告分别被判刑5年、2年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258520]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 13, 2023, the Shenzhen Nanshan District People’s Court prosecuted the defendant Wu Moulong for abducting children and The first-instance public verdict was made in the case of Wu Mouguang&#39;s cover-up. Wu Moulong was sentenced to five years in prison for child abduction, and Wu Mouguang was sentenced to two years in prison for the crime of cover-up. At the same time, the court ordered Wu Molong to compensate Sun Moufei and Peng Mouying for their losses of 420,000 yuan, and to compensate Fu and Peng Moumou for their losses of 420,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court found that the defendant Wu Moulong abducted the victims Sun and Fu in Nanshan District, Shenzhen on October 9 and December 28, 2007, and took them with him. He went to the defendant Wu Mouguang&#39;s residence to hide. Subsequently, Wu Moulong handed over the victims to their fellow villagers or relatives to be raised. On September 27, 2021, when the public security agency questioned Wu Mouguang, Wu Mouguang deliberately made false proofs about important plots in this case in order to cover Wu Moulong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court held that the defendant Wu Moulong abducted minors under the age of fourteen and separated them from their families or guardians, and his behavior constituted the crime of child abduction. The defendant Wu Mouguang knew about Wu Moulong&#39;s criminal behavior and gave false evidence to cover him up. His behavior constituted the crime of cover-up. The court made the above judgment based on the criminal facts, nature, circumstances and guilty plea performance of the two defendants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 people including some NPC deputies, CPPCC members, journalists and people from all walks of life attended the sentencing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以冲突引发撕裂，澳大利亚陷入争论]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258509]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 14:56:13&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国产剧终于不再斗小三了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258463]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;This year, with female relations as the Among the themed film and television dramas, the operation of &quot;Good Things Come in Twos&quot; is definitely considered bold. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The first wife Lin Shuang, played by Zhang Xiaofei, actually formed the &quot;Avengers Alliance&quot; with the mistress Jiang Xi, played by Zhang Jiani, and not only joined forces to tear apart the scumbag Wei Ming played by Li Zefeng , also joined hands to start a new company and find their own value in life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/fcc38fa60c059ef51b6b981089d1c881.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;531&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/fcc38fa60c059ef51b6b981089d1c881.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253859 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Going back three years, such a plot is still unimaginable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, Lin Youyou played by Zhang Yue in &quot;Only Thirty&quot; was criticized by the audience for his mistress behavior in the play, and even extended to the actor himself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But three years later in &quot;Good Things Come in Twos&quot;, the situation has changed a lot: in addition to being annoying and hateful, the audience noticed more from Jiang Xi What is most remarkable is her suffering and tenacity, as well as the tacit understanding of sympathy with her first wife. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, looking back at domestic dramas, it is not difficult to find that the role of mistress is always changing, and the discussion of marriage relationships with the help of this image also reflects the changes in social values.

Although he also cheated on her, he still loved Gemma, both physically and mentally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/949cc880e3657b2e19c5b1a2ebff2f56.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;648&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/949cc880e3657b2e19c5b1a2ebff2f56.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253870&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This kind of setting is more complex and full-bodied than domestic marriage dramas. In &quot;Good Things Come in Twos&quot;, the scumbag husband Wei Ming teams up with his first wife Lin Shuang and his mistress Jiang Xi - the former is an unthinking stereotype, and the latter is a crude setting that takes it for granted to cater to feminism. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Doctor Foster&quot;, Gemma did not rely on anyone. She was calm and composed in the great pain, and she calmly tried to find ways to regain what she had lost. Everything ended in the fact that the mistress was pregnant with her husband&#39;s child in front of her husband, mistress and mistress&#39;s family. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Besides this main line, there are other extramarital affairs patterns in &quot;Doctor Foster&quot;.

After watching the entire concert standing in the aisle, he found someone standing in the aisle watching the performance like them. He speculated that other people might have bought fake tickets without knowing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at the entire process, the counterfeit notes held by Mr. Chen not only passed the first manual inspection, but also passed the second gate inspection. Even when he was confronted with the real tickets in the end, they were all purchased through the other party&#39;s presentation. Ticket records are used to determine the authenticity of tickets. It is also questionable whether the on-site staff can actually verify the validity of the tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fans have reported that ticketing management may be tightened&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Frequent ticketing disputes have aroused strong dissatisfaction among the public. Many fans said that they have reported to relevant departments and have been arrested. accepted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The organizer is also suspected of reacting to this.

Audiences must swipe the turnstile on site to verify their ID card and face before entering the venue with their real name.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But whether there is really any improvement depends on the live situation in the next few performances. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are many tricks for scalpers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that under the strong real-name system, the business of many &quot;scalpers&quot; is no longer buying and selling, but &quot;robbing on behalf of others.&quot; They will bind the customer&#39;s ID card information in advance, and if the ticket is not obtained, 100% of the money &quot;snatched&quot; will be returned to the customer. It is this mentality of giving it a try without losing money that makes many Jay Chou&#39;s die-hard fans choose to &quot;grab it on behalf of others&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some media consulted a &quot;scalper&quot; as a consumer, and the other party said that the &quot;snatching&quot; price of Jay Chou&#39;s stands at the Shanghai Stadium is 1,500 yuan, while the ticket price for the stands is 580 yuan-1,280 Prices vary from RMB 2,080 to RMB 2,500 for tickets priced at 2,080 yuan in the infield, and RMB 2,000 for tickets priced at other prices in the infield. It is understood that some are &quot;robbed&quot; manually, while more advanced ones use special software. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is difficult to distinguish the authenticity of the so-called &quot;proxy shooting&quot; service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investigation found that if it is a real &quot;scalper&quot;, then after the customer selects the seat class, he must pay the &quot;scalper&quot; in advance the ticket fee and hundreds or even thousands of yuan in agency fees, and the ticket will be issued by a familiar person. &quot;Scalpers&quot; who follow the rules and use proxy auction software use customers&#39; personal information to grab tickets. If you fail to grab a ticket, the real &quot;scalper&quot; will refund the ticket fee and the auction fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if you encounter fake &quot;scalpers&quot;, customers are likely to suffer heavy losses. Fake &quot;scalpers&quot; do not help purchase tickets, but use various methods such as &quot;upgrading seats&quot; and &quot;increasing the probability&quot; to induce customers to continuously increase service fees, and eventually disappear without a trace, defrauding customers of huge ticket fees and service fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, &quot;internal invitation letters/internal tickets&quot; and &quot;bringing in by staff&quot; are also full of doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social platforms, some netizens posted photos of &quot;internal invitations/internal tickets&quot;, but other netizens quickly pointed out: This was a fake invitation modeled after another performance—— Although the ticket looks very similar, the counterfeiter was careless and got the performance venue wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, it is also difficult to fulfill &quot;the staff will lead you into the performance site&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the information transmitted online, some &quot;staff members&quot; claim to be from the &quot;ticketing company&quot;, while others claim to be from the &quot;security company&quot;. Not to mention that their identities cannot be verified. Even if they can be led in, It is also an illegal act, and both the person taking the person and the person being taken should bear legal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/ea8fa937c2dbc8a1ddcd08ab3f06f07d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;554&quot; height= &quot;181&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/ea8fa937c2dbc8a1ddcd08ab3f06f07d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253966&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public is advised to When purchasing performance tickets, stick to official channels or formal platforms, and do not trust second-hand online transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[曾梵志：过往皆风景，此刻在闪烁]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258491]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/12/K1PChqShECUyd7DBIMACbOQFyPiSF6km59ypqIjV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;634&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/K1PChqShECUyd7DBIMACbOQFyPiSF6km59ypqI jV. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253939&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zeng Fanzhi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Jiang Xiaoming/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Use 40 colors to create 400 colors&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, and use&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;3 kinds of purple&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong >;Create&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;A silent black&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is “an art exhibition that was publicized in advance”: since Shanghai Pudong Art Museum announced that it will hold a large-scale solo exhibition of artist Zeng Fanzhi Since then, people have been waiting for the debut of the &quot;star&quot; whose oil paintings have fetched astonishingly high prices and his new works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, 2023, the exhibition &quot;Zeng Fanzhi: Past and Present (Paintings 1988-2023)&quot; opened. Fabrice Hergot, Director of the Musée d&#39;Art Moderne de Paris ( Fabrice Hergott serves as the chief curator, selecting more than 60 representative works created by Zeng Fanzhi in the past 35 years, and presenting &quot;Looking Back at the Early Years&quot;, &quot;Different Paths&quot;, and &quot;Like Meditation&quot; in the high and spacious space of Pudong Art Museum. Four units, including &quot;Extra Large Scale&quot; and &quot;Extra Large Scale&quot;, encourage viewers to experience the secret of painting as a traditional art medium that continues to thrive today through more active and personal viewing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that Zeng Fanzhi’s latest “Flickering Paintings” series makes its world debut in the exhibition. He has long since taken off his &quot;mask&quot;, turned decisively away from the various &quot;landscapes&quot; of the &quot;past&quot;, and devoted himself to a brand new experiment. Pointing to the largest work in the exhibition, &quot;Flickering Painting - Light III,&quot; Hergot said that this work reminded him of the grand atmosphere at the beginning of &quot;Genesis&quot; in the Bible. In this huge work of 480cm x 400cm, Zeng Fanzhi combined two oil canvases. The upper part depicts the magnificent scene of the sunrise with the clouds opening, and the lower part depicts the shimmering water surface reflected in the rays of sunlight. From a distance, it is a vast expanse of water. Elegant and bright pink and purple, a variety of rich and varied colors and textures can be observed up close. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/i2hjFeg022j8QSil2Jvw2WEi0TCFCbMeoSBoS4NF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;959&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/i2hjFeg022j8QSil2Jvw2WEi0TCFCbMeoSBoS4NF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253938&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Still Life, 2020, oil on canvas, 60 x 60 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Fan Members of Zhi Studio had reminded the media that the artist would not comment on the new work in this interview. However, after the press conference and when he returned to the exhibition site, a timid girl finally summoned up the courage to ask a question that everyone was curious about. ——&quot;I personally feel that these new works resemble the style of Pointillism.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s own response to the new &quot;Flickering Paintings&quot; was not &quot;evasive&quot; at all. Like a teacher from an art academy who faces students, he sincerely &quot;teaches&quot; the girl: &quot;The Pointillist artist you are talking about was an artist 100 years ago. At that time, he used three primary colors. When he wanted to express one primary color, he used different blues. Together with the yellow dot, let you feel the green, but it is relatively simple. Our color changes are too advanced now!&quot; As he said, he walked in front of a piece of &quot;Flickering Painting - Dragon Heads Up I&quot;, showing a mysterious and proud look. The smile continued, &quot;Compared with the artists of that era, I used 40 colors to create 400 colors in this work. Pointillism is relatively simple. In the early days of modern art, everyone was looking for their own set of colors. In terms of language expression, there are probably not hundreds of colors to be found in the works at that time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same exhibition hall of the &quot;Like Meditation&quot; unit, directly opposite the &quot;Dragon Heading Up&quot; with densely colored dots, It is a very contrasting, almost completely black &quot;Flickering Painting - Untitled&quot;. Zeng Fanzhi told me with a smile, &quot;This is really my first work in this new series, but others thought I was bragging. &quot;Compared with the complex brushstrokes, the color of this painting seems to be very pure. At first glance, it is a silent black. &quot;I particularly like this painting, but it does not use black from beginning to end.&quot; The creative process , Zeng Fanzhi combines three different shades of purple, a secret that can only be discovered when viewed up close under the right light. In order to confirm that it was deep purple, he led me to the &quot;Flickering Painting - Water VII&quot; next door, pointed to the edge of the intersection of &quot;black&quot; and white and said seriously, &quot;Look here, you can see that it is deep purple.&quot; .&quot; Because of the clear and straight dividing line, the white waterfall on the picture appears as a solid shape in the dark background. Zeng Fanzhi said with a smile, &quot;Some of them even said, hey! What you painted is not a &#39;1&#39;?! I really don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a long period of partial practice, Zeng Fanzhi developed wonderful visual effects in the new series &quot;Flickering Paintings&quot;, &quot; Although color, composition and texture play their respective roles in every aspect of painting, in the medium of painting, they can never be separated from each other and become isolated existences.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, what he never forgets the most is The first moment when I successfully &quot;blacked out&quot; the picture with 3 shades of purple. Before leaving the exhibition hall, he stood next to the dark &quot;Untitled&quot; and suddenly discovered that under the influence of light, the picture took on a gray-green effect at a certain angle. Zeng Fanzhi took out his mobile phone to take a picture of its &quot;side face&quot; with great interest, and couldn&#39;t help but murmured excitedly, &quot;This &#39;like meditation&#39; should be called &#39;Niu B Space&#39;!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/FZ8FQPPOrcklj3F2o1XKD7kTHZYWnhrBQdBa26sw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;624&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/FZ8FQPPOrcklj3F2o1XKD7kTHZYWnhrBQdBa26sw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253940&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Abstract Landscape - Night, 2005, oil on canvas, 215 x 330 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; Barefoot people wearing masks, shoeshine people at dusk&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The day before the exhibition opened, when crowds gathered to wait for the internal tour, Zeng Fanzhi was sitting cross-legged in a corner of the cafe, with his feet Wearing low-key sneakers, his indifferent expression is indeed in contrast to the high-spirited portrait in Liu Heung-cheng&#39;s photography exhibition upstairs. In 2012, Zeng Fanzhi tried on a pair of handmade leather shoes in a luxury store in London. The shoes were polished and polished. , he stood on tiptoe with his left foot, opened his suit with both hands, and was so happy that he almost flew up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the &quot;mask&quot; and the painting inside the painting, &quot;shoes&quot; are probably the most important annotations and metaphors for Zeng Fanzhi and his works. Portraits and still lifes run through his creations, and the 2009 sketch oil painting &quot;Boots&quot; is particularly special. This work was inspired by Van Gogh&#39;s 1886 work &quot;A Pair of Shoes&quot; and can be regarded as both a still life and a painting. Considered a portrait. When Zeng Fanzhi created &quot;Boots&quot;, it coincided with the explosive growth of Chinese contemporary art. The boots in the painting also represent the increasingly glamorous and glitzy life he faced. Zeng Fanzhi chose to take them off and examine them. While creating &quot;Boots&quot;, he also completed a self-portrait, in which he is holding a paintbrush, wearing a simple robe and bare feet. For a long time, the two works were hung side by side on the same wall within sight of his studio. Through this secret method, Zeng Fanzhi showed his confusion and determination for the future in his daily creations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the creation of the &quot;Mask&quot; series, the image of &quot;barefoot&quot; had already begun to emerge. Zeng Fanzhi moved to Beijing in 1993, and a year later the theme of the &quot;Mask Series&quot; emerged: he observed the crowds in big cities from the perspective of a bystander, expressing the contradiction between his individual consciousness and social identity. After the birth of this series, he began to attract attention from the international art world, and this thematic creation lasted for nearly 10 years. The &quot;Mask Series&quot; as a whole shows the trend of characters&#39; clothing becoming more and more exquisite and their facial expressions becoming increasingly blurred. However, &quot;Mask Series 1995 No. 14&quot; is a special case. The hands of the characters in the painting are exaggerated and enlarged, but the bare feet are still used. It is presented in normal proportions, so it appears top-heavy, with a certain humorous and self-deprecating temperament. The carefully dressed image forms a contradictory relationship with the naked feet, which also shows part of Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s life experience at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/HRVNziT5bJU84oTUlQD1TteDUaGfsF8bdxIRs3zY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;832&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/HRVNziT5bJU84oTUlQD1TteDUaGfsF8bdxIRs3zY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253941&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mask Series 1995 No. 7, 1995, oil on canvas, 150 x 130 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Looking back at the early days&quot;, Zeng Fanzhi specifically mentioned two &quot;Twilight&quot; films: &quot;Twilight&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Twilight II&quot; in 1993. In the late 1980s, he studied in the Oil Painting Department of Hubei Academy of Fine Arts. At that time, he had received a series of technical training from the academy, but he was a disobedient student. &quot;&quot;Twilight&quot; in 1989 was a very important early work of mine. Because of the academic education back then, students had to go to the countryside or Tibet or the Loess Plateau every year to experience life and paint those local style paintings. But at that time, I worked with the school&#39;s I have a different idea. I said that my life is around me and I must paint places I am familiar with. I don’t go to those places in northern Shaanxi and spend two weeks painting people herding sheep. This painting is the one I pass by after school every day. Scene: A group of people are preparing to shine someone&#39;s shoes on the street. When someone comes, they sit on this chair to shine their shoes. Usually they sit here bored. To me, this scene is very interesting and touches me, so I made a sketch for them at the time, then went back and quickly completed the painting based on my feeling.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four years later, Zeng Fanzhi created &quot;Twilight II&quot; in Beijing. The old title is used in the structure, and it also depicts the streets of Wuhan in the evening. &quot;Dusk&quot; is a real-life sketch, while &quot;Twilight 2&quot; is a new composition that combines the scenes in his memory with the characters around him. The smoke on the ground on the left , glass ballast, etc. were all extracted from the fireworks and the corners of the streets of Wuhan at that time. In this way, memory fragments from his growing experience continued to flash in Zeng Fanzhi’s future creations. Even in his subsequent abstract works, sometimes he There will also be characters from legends or old movies hidden deep within the intricate lines, and they will be imagined and portrayed in a rather subjective way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/XfSsH3lKZSdGcidFVCoqHIanDhmYP9eSWZ1JPdhV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;863&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/XfSsH3lKZSdGcidFVCoqHIanDhmYP9eSWZ1JPdhV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253942&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dusk II, 1993, oil on canvas, 180 x 200 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>;Laughing red, melancholy green, a portrait of Freud&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2004, Zeng Fanzhi officially bid farewell to &quot;Portrait&quot; with a painting of a toy wooden horse. Mask Series&quot;. This masterpiece is often regarded as his self-portrait. The mask on the figure&#39;s face has been removed, but his expression is dull and unfathomable: he is no longer classified as an &quot;urban group&quot; of that era, but is regarded as a unique individual. Characterized by individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The projections of the characters and the wooden horse in different directions in &quot;Portrait&quot; create a weird and innocent atmosphere; his red coat forms a strong contrast with the green dotted on the corners of his clothes and the wooden horse&#39;s skateboard. Looking back at the &quot;past&quot;, large areas of red and a few strokes of emotional green have appeared repeatedly in Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s creations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/foJlx89PCRI51ElRK5MML0pMkeFJXZRSskKDRmfC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;959&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/foJlx89PCRI51ElRK5MML0pMkeFJXZRSskKDRmfC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253943&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Abstract Landscape - Huang, 2021, oil on canvas, 400 x 400 cm (double) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The first abstract work to be shown in this exhibition, &quot;Cow Dance II&quot; (1988), is covered with large areas of thick red paint. In order to create this work, Zeng Fanzhi spent a lot of time Lots of oil paint. According to his recollection, many classmates laughed at him for being wasteful at that time, but he remained unmoved and insisted that only enough materials can ensure a real touch, and touch can drive inspiration. He firmly believed that only through constant hands-on practice, To find the direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of &quot;Laughing Benin&quot; (1989) is a large area of ​​intense red, and the characters in &quot;The Melancholy Man&quot; (1990) wear sad green pants... These are all examples of Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s exploration of color expression. ’s first creations. &quot;&quot;Melancholy Man&quot; is a work I painted with my classmate Zhou Ning as the model. I was very satisfied at the time and I was very moved. From this painting, I realized how to use colors and lines to express emotions. The painting speed was very fast and I was very excited, including the look in his eyes, which allowed me to be integrated with the work when expressing it. Before, we drew a model randomly and had nothing to do with the model, but this work can integrate my own feelings into the painting. This It is a particularly important beginning in my portraiture.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/b2vV00PfuKiBh59Es1uK6V7WViF7oHn2z0nwbJcb.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/b2vV00PfuKiBh59Es1uK6V7WViF7oHn2z0nwbJcb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253944&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Part of the flickering painting series__2023 Zeng Fanzhi &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Ning was also the model for &quot;Laughing Beckning&quot;. The title of that work uniquely combined the names of Zhou Ning and Max Beckmann, a German expressionist painter who had a profound influence on Zeng Fanzhi at the time. . Zhou Ning was the most frequently invited painting model by Zeng Fanzhi at that time. It was not easy to maintain one posture for a long time. In order to appease the models, Zeng Fanzhi would prepare small gifts from time to time. He still remembers that in order to complete &quot;The Melancholy Man&quot;, he reluctantly gave a box of lunch meat to Zhou Ning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/5aqsrnpy1QRbYD4ORt97Mb5EbHwyzTDC39NbMVPD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;722&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/5aqsrnpy1QRbYD4ORt97Mb5EbHwyzTDC39NbMVPD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253945&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Portrait, 2004, oil on canvas, 200 x 150 cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When creating &quot;The Melancholy Man&quot;, Zeng Fanzhi used a spatula extensively to present concrete shapes with abstract brushstrokes to capture the inner feelings of the characters. Emotions and compositions are both narrative and situational, yet extremely restrained. These techniques continued into his future portrait creations. After the mid-middle period, many of Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s portraits were completed with a scraper, and all the backgrounds of the characters were hidden by leaving blank spaces. In works such as &quot;Hugo&quot; (2018), an upward scratch is left on the top of the character&#39;s head to hide the brush strokes of the oil painting, while showing a certain dynamic and making the character&#39;s expression more &quot;freehand&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When I create portraits, I definitely paint people I like and people I know well. Hugo was an old photo I accidentally found. I felt very excited when I saw it. He was sitting there. There, the eyes caught my attention, so interesting! Many people think that I look at my hands first when painting, but in fact, from the moment his eyes made contact with me, I felt that this would definitely make a good portrait.&quot; Zeng Fan Zhi revealed to me, &quot;When painting eyes and faces, I have to do it in one stroke. The first 60% of this is accidental. When the color of the knife rolls inside, you have to predict what changes will happen inside with one stroke. It depends on some luck. , there is also an element of control, you must be very fast when scraping up, and it will be scraped up with just one stroke of the knife.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/12/w1quOl9L586bY8x4o3c0NC4NxzBpSFgFHIOoGt0k.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;785&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/ w1quOl9L586bY8x4o3c0NC4NxzBpSFgFHIOoGt0k.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253946&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Melancholic Man, 1990, oil on canvas, 110 x 90 cm&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Opposite the &quot;angry&quot; &quot;Hugo&quot;, the artist Lucian Freud&#39;s eyes were slightly blurred in Zeng Fanzhi&#39;s 2017 creation. The image of being closed and lying on a bed attracted everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;Speaking of Freud, I first saw his works in the library when I was in college. My first impression was also about the eyes. There were very complex emotions in the eyes he painted. It is difficult to express a person&#39;s emotions in painting. His eyes were very interesting and inspired me a lot. Later, when I painted, I also paid great attention to people’s eyes.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Freud has always been Zeng Fanzhi’s idol, and he especially admired him. The artist has strong creative power after middle age and a strong character that is not disturbed by the outside world. When I mentioned, &quot;Compared with the seated portrait in 2011, how different my mood was when I created this work on his deathbed in 2017&quot;, Zeng Fanzhi said frankly that the many portraits he created of Freud were actually They all reflect his inner projection of ideals at different stages. &quot;When I look at Freud&#39;s works, I pay great attention to the time of his creation. Then I always want to compare it with my own age. How old was he when he painted this painting? How old is he when I study it now? When I see exhibitions, I like to compare it with my own age. Let others compare, because I am also an artist. I think Freud is great. His seventies were actually the peak of his creation. His previous works were also very good, but his paintings were very tight and his eyes were very large. But the luster is a little different from that in his later years. He was a bit neurotic in his early years, but his creations in his later years, including the size and volume of his works, are very good. I have seen many large-scale exhibitions of Freud, and he is someone I particularly admire. An artist who is 70 or 80 years old can still draw from life so well! You know, life drawing is challenging for artists.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/12/z43zVFskPkY4JcscNieL7HEofT7HnKoHquYeQKgn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;805&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/12/z43zVFskPkY4JcscNieL7HEofT7HnKoHquYeQKgn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253947&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Flicker Painting - Light III, 2019-2023 , oil on canvas, 480 x 400 cm (diptych) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Fanzhi was told of the opportunity to meet Freud I was very excited about this, but unfortunately, the news of Floyd&#39;s death came not long after. This work created in 2017 was inspired by a photo of Freud in his later years, but Zeng Fanzhi highly refined and recreated it: the entire painting is filled with a sense of ethereal loneliness, and Freud’s white robe and His whole body is filled with a strange halo, and the bed he lies on only retains a few hasty outlines, showing an unfinished state... This is the last painting Zeng Fanzhi paid tribute to Freud.

In April this year, Han Ting dived to a depth of 277 meters in Jiudun Skylight, once again breaking the Asian record for deepest cave diving, only 9 meters away from the world record of 286 meters. “The days are long,” Han Ting once described his experience of “just missing” the world record. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiudun Skylight is what explorers call &quot;China&#39;s Underwater Everest&quot;. Du Lei, Han Ting&#39;s friend and director of the China Exploration Association, described to Nandu and N video reporters that Jiudun Skylight is like Han Ting&#39;s &quot;home&quot;. In recent years, he has continued to conduct underwater cave exploration and diving teaching here, and has participated in underwater rescues many times.只是这一次，韩颋在这里与外界失联，多日后在水下百余米处被发现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;得知这一消息，杜雷向南都记者发来一句话：“在追求自己梦想的路上闪逝，哪个探险者能享有如此结局。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;10月11日，韩颋创立的蓝旗国际潜水俱乐部发文称，自7日晚始，潜水员韩颋失联已三天多，由于出事洞穴位置太深，故救援无法完全展开，目前搜救工作未有明显进展。感谢大家的关心，后续可以关注官方正式通告，了解详细情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同日晚些时候，南都记者从多位知情人士处获悉，韩颋在九顿天窗水下百余米处被发现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于极限运动爱好者来说，死亡并非不能触及的话题。杜雷向南都记者回忆道，之前韩颋和他讨论过，如果生命终了，希望自己能停留在最喜欢的地方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;得知韩颋在水下被发现，杜雷向南都记者发来一句话：“在追求自己梦想的路上闪逝，哪个探险者能享有如此结局。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;水下珠峰&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在杜雷看来，九顿天窗就像韩颋的“家”。近几年来，他经常在此潜水、教学。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;九顿天窗位于九顿村九顿屯周边，九顿坡立谷边缘的一座山峰脚下。这里清晰见底的果冻水常年保持19℃的水温，在阳光照耀下波光粼粼。由于澄江河每到春季和夏季，河面上就会开满洁白的海菜花，来此玩耍的游客称“这是一条会开花的河”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;曾到此地游玩过的韦女士告诉南都记者，到当地游玩的游客以亲子、年轻人居多，“确实是很美，海菜花长在水下，根茎很长、花很多，很壮观”，但“周边环境比较原始，没看到什么工作人员”。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据了解，该景区门票免费，游客可以在此体验游泳、桨板、潜水等项目，桨板需要租借。韦女士说，玩桨板的人比较多，但也看到个别在岸边穿专业服装准备潜水的游客。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/6f887e4d453b8e3203b9514163e4c4d2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;

&lt;p>;普通游客喜欢来此游泳看花，潜水爱好者则把这里当作“游戏天堂”。九顿溢流天窗群由四个斜井式天窗组成，其最深点仍未被发现，被誉为“中国水下珠峰”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年，澳大利亚的湿骡探险队来到这里，花费7个多小时潜到了水下212米的深度，尽管如此，他们仍未寻找到九顿天窗的底部。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杜雷告诉南都记者，韩颋之所以选择在九顿天窗打破亚洲纪录、冲击世界纪录，也是因为这里相对其他洞穴来说更深、更垂直、更好下潜，水质也更好。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他曾与韩颋一起在此下过水。他说，九顿天窗7至9米深的水下已接近微光层，甚至完全无光，下潜至十四五米就基本是完全黑暗的环境了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杜雷向南都记者介绍，“在可见光的环境里，各种各样高低不一、层次分明的水草伴着成群游动的鱼，潜水者仿佛在景观鱼缸里游泳”，下潜到更深处则“像在玻璃里一样，水的透度非常好，没什么杂质”。此外，洞穴周围的岩石十分陡峭，垂直向下，“让你感觉到一眼看不到底，也会吸引你去看看下面到底是什么”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;潜水爱好者李先生每年都会到都安潜水一两次，九顿、吞榜、桃花水母、太阳天窗，他都去过。他告诉南都记者，由于不是本地人，不完全了解地形，他也会担心安全问题，因此每次都会与很多人一起潜水，“大家都在自己潜水级别的标准内潜水，互相照应，会减少一些安全隐患”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李先生还提到，九顿天窗水下有警示牌，提醒潜水爱好者不要进洞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;警示牌背后，是频发的安全事故。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年4月，深圳水下探索俱乐部王先生一行3人到该地考察，并进行潜水探险活动，其中一名潜水者入水后迟迟未浮出水面。潜水专家在下潜到51米处的一处洞穴发现了失踪者，经检查确认，失踪者当时已失去生命体征。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年，两名中国潜水员在九顿天窗下潜，一人遇难。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年，潜水员宫紫薇、董杰的遗体分别于10月6日和2日在都安九顿世界天窗水下被发现。值得一提的是，韩颋也参与了此次搜救工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;塔尖之人&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在潜水界，韩颋有个响亮的外号——“老猫”。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;休闲潜水员小飞告诉南都记者：“老猫属于潜水界金字塔尖的人。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据杭州市潜水运动协会介绍，韩颋出生于1976年，2014年在泰国考取PADI（国际专业潜水培训系统）潜水员证书，潜龄至今已有19年，是国内首位休闲水肺、自由潜水和技术潜水三栖教练。同时，他也是蓝旗潜水国际俱乐部创始人之一。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2010年，韩颋开始学习洞穴潜水探索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一个洞穴可能千百万年来从没有人进去过，你也不知道下一秒会发生什么。”在央视纪录片《极致中国第二季》广西都安篇中，他解释了自己热爱洞潜的原因，“洞穴里的经历或感受，有的时候会把你的阴暗面勾出来，这是对自己认识和对话的过程。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韩颋把洞潜玩到极致，曾创下多项纪录：空气洞穴深潜世界纪录128米，水下洞穴Mnemo测绘深度世界纪录202米等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年4月，他在九顿天窗成功下潜到277米深处，再次打破洞穴大深度潜水的亚洲纪录，距世界纪录286米仅差9米。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南都记者从中国探险协会得知，韩颋起初接触潜水只是因为好玩，将爱好发展为专业后，他感到自己身上多了一份责任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年，韩颋开设了都安蓝旗潜水俱乐部，以培养更多潜水人才。近年来，他还在广西地区开展水下洞穴的系统性探索，负责在都安筹建亚洲首个世界级洞穴潜水培训基地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/c3a20c313405d48ef5ef2dad4122d361.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;446&quot;

&lt;p>;此外，他参与创建中国科研潜水体系，协助实施中国极端水下环境科学考察研究；多次负责或参与电视或电影的水下特种拍摄及高难度拍摄，制定并实施解决方案；致力于推进公共安全潜水培训，进行潜水方向的消防、救援培训工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年，韩颋参与广西酒海井红军长征烈士骸骨勘探打捞，让沉睡在水底83年的红军战士重见天日。 2020年，他参与广西都安桃花水母天窗事故的打捞工作，下潜至143米完成遇难者遗体搜索打捞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纪录片《极致中国第二季》中提到，洞穴潜水被认为是世界上最危险的运动之一，即便是最资深的潜水者也会命悬一线。中国探险协会也曾在文章中提及，洞潜事故多发生在不正规、缺乏监管的“野潜”活动中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韩颋对此深有感触：“不该是这样的。我希望能踏踏实实做一点事情，让大家认识到正确的路应该怎么走，正确的态度应该是怎样，至少能多影响一些人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“来日方长”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在好友杜雷看来，韩颋作为亚洲洞潜纪录保持者，在不断突破自我的过程中，却从未突破过安全底线。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果换作是我，在感觉和设备都良好的情况下，我能不能和他一样忍住继续下潜的冲动？”谈及今年4月韩颋只差9米就打破洞潜世界纪录一事，杜雷不禁感慨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比于沉稳的韩颋，杜雷觉得自己身上带着些许“莽气”。韩颋曾反复提醒他：“在探险的过程中，千万别给自己设定一个必须要达到的&#39;坎&#39;，这样会造成特别大的安全隐患。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/3cc9adcdb873b540b2178328da56819c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;980&quot;

&lt;p>;“来日方长”，韩颋曾这样描述自己与世界纪录“擦肩而过”的经历。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他曾公开表示，“本次计划深度270至290米，到达计划区域时，我犹豫了1秒，只需要再多1分钟就可以破世界纪录。但是，我现在很高兴，自己抵住了诱惑，按照计划停止下潜、打结、放箭头标、上升。来日方长。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韩颋对安全的高度把控，还体现在潜水设备的选择上。杜雷曾向韩颋讨教该如何选择CCR，韩颋向他推荐了一款内有两套工作系统的设备。 “相当于一个机器里有两台发动机，如果有一台坏了，还能用另外一台。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杜雷告诉南都记者，在日常的下水活动中，韩颋常身背两套CCR。 “相当于他拿着四个安全备份，这对我来说是个特别大的启迪。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年4月，韩颋打破亚洲纪录时就采用了双侧挂CCR三元混合气技术。据中国潜水救捞行业协会介绍，CCR是呼吸循环回路系统，可使气体不断在回路中单向循环流动。利用CCR进行潜水可以显著减少气体浪费，大幅延长水下停留时间，使得潜水员有充足的时间完成水下探索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但CCR也存在使用复杂、操作容错率低等弊端。杜雷分析，韩颋失事极有可能是遇到了设备问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杜雷向南都记者解释，在不断下潜的过程中，潜水员需要根据压强变化调整吸入气体的比例。但在使用CCR的情况下，如果氧气比例降低，潜水员可能无法立即察觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“个体会有憋闷感，是因为血液内二氧化碳浓度过高。但CCR的二氧化碳吸附剂会把呼吸气体里的二氧化碳全部吸附干净，不会让人产生憋气的感觉。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;教室里只有他一个人的声音，以及粉笔用力划过黑板的吱吱声。强健的臂力，让书写的摩擦力不断增强，于是留下很浓的粉印，连划痕也拖不动时，那粉笔便跳跃起来，再重重地撞击，刻蚀下几个粉点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那字结构方正，在行草之间，压缩着无尽的力量，似欲喷涌而出，却又被那无形的气息收敛得有些圆润，就像吴老师的身量一般。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/N6Dw6SQVkC98R9bhkx4WMfmOj1HsIC6N7YrJqcvN.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;吴熊和（1934-2012），上海人，长期在杭州大学（后并入浙江大学）中文系任教。他师从一代词宗夏承焘先生，在唐宋词学方面取得了令人瞩目的成就。代表作《唐宋词通论》，是一部自成体系的词学专著，在理论、方法和具体考证上都有创新与突破。他的课，是中文系同学的最爱。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（作者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴老师的声音，开始时是舒缓的，低沉的，带着浓厚的吴音，仿佛在一个巨大的音箱里回旋，如静水深流。随着诗词内容的展开，那声音也扩散着。吴老师渐渐地沉浸其中，轻声细说，缓缓流动，然后奔流激涌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的句子不长，用词，是两字、两字，四字、四字，再五字，再七字，声音从缓趋急，节奏由慢到快，直到长句的高亢激烈，戛然而止。停顿——仿佛世界都静止了。当你以为那是忘词了的时候，又开始低缓地流淌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原来那是他心潮奔涌，不能自已，先抑制一下，再重启前行。这才发现，那时他右手捏着粉笔，敲击着左手，定定地望着前方，看的却不是前面的同学或是桌椅，而是仿佛透过了另一个时空。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴老师通常先诵读诗句，然后逐句讲解。那诗句原文，就像是一个浓缩的原点，他的讲解，则是洞开了一个世界。用他的语言，拨动那诗句，仿佛变幻着魔术，那三三两两的话语，依次流入我们的脑海，我们则在脑海中卷舒开一幅幅画面。我们的眼睛化为镜头，文字转为画像，看到了由远及近的场景，体察入微的近景，不同镜头的剪辑组合……让我们与诗人的心跳，合上了同一节奏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那诗里，一字是一象，两字成一境；两字加一动词，别是一境；一组意象再加一组意象，复合为另一境。数境叠合，总成一大境。那被分解开来的镜头，自然地、巧妙地、奇特地衔接，构成一个完整的作品世界，那就是诗词的“意境”，仿佛身临其境，触手可及。若是“无我之境”，万籁俱寂，我与境一；若是“有我之境”，便不由得担心，担心会惊动那境中的天人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就像“明月松间照，清泉石上流”两句，让我们也化身王维的视角，穿越过去，看到了摩诘眼中那个真实的世界，不是，是想象中的世界；也不是，是他用镜头剪辑出来的世界，他发现的美。美，就是诗人发现并选择的结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴老师具体的讲解，我早已忘记。但他为我打开了诗词世界的大门，让我别有所悟，自如出入。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（本文作者黄仕忠，现为中山大学中文系教授。1978-1985年在杭州大学读本科和研究生时，聆听过吴老师的课。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[野泳要防“食脑虫”：全球范围内从无到有，应予以关切]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258373]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the hot summer, people like to swim in lakes and rivers, but now they may face a new risks of. A doctor said on Weibo: &quot;A child during consultation was swimming in a reservoir and was infected with cerebral amoeba. The brain tissue has softened, and the family is unwilling to give up. The friend who swam with the child was fine, but he was infected. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amoeba is a kind of microorganism. Due to different living environments, it can be divided into entamoeba and free-living amoeba. The former is parasitic on humans and animals, and the latter lives in water and In the soil, it occasionally invades animal bodies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many types of amoeba, which can cause dysentery and liver abscesses, meningoencephalitis, keratitis, oral infections and skin lesions. Encephalitis is caused by the amoeba Naegleria. Naegleria-containing amoeba prefers hot and humid environments, and is commonly found in warm water environments above 25°C. Its fecundity is strongest at about 42°C. In nature, they are found in rivers, ponds, puddles and other water bodies, and they may also be found in hot springs and moist soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a person swims in rivers, lakes or washes his nose with infected water, Naegleria enters the nasal cavity. After proliferating, it passes through the nasal mucosa and cribriform plate, travels up the olfactory nerve, enters the brain, and invades Central nervous system, causing primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brain tissue is the best place for amoeba to survive. It is rich in phospholipids and has a suitable temperature. Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis has a short incubation period, usually only 3 to 5 days, and a maximum of 7 to 15 days. The onset is sudden and the disease progresses rapidly. Early symptoms of infection include: headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, and neck stiffness; late symptoms include: dizziness, loss of balance, epileptic seizures, abnormal taste and smell, and hallucinations, followed by rapid transition to delirium, paralysis, and coma. Patients often die from brain infection, swelling, and brain function cessation caused by a sudden increase in intracranial pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is still a lack of ideal drugs for the treatment of this disease. Amphotericin B and sulfonamides may have certain effects, but in general, infected people often only have three to seven days to live after symptoms appear, and they die from the infection. The rate can reach more than 95%. Because of this characteristic, this amoeba also has a terrifying name: brain-eating worm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This disease first &quot;appeared&quot; in Australia in 1965, and there are only a few hundred cases of infection worldwide. About half of the cases reported in the past occurred in the United States, and reports have also been reported in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and other countries. According to the records of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the past 53 years, there have been only 133 reports of amoeba infection in the United States. The mortality rate of such patients is high, and only 3 people have survived. In July 2015, a young woman in central California, USA, died from infection with the brain-eating amoeba amoeba. In 2015, 14-year-old track and field player Mike Riley in Houston, Texas, contracted the amoeba &quot;brain-eating worm&quot; after swimming in a lake and died a week later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first case in China occurred in Zhumadian area of ​​Henan Province in 1978 and was reported by Shanghai First Medical College in 1984. Since then, Beijing Friendship Hospital reported one case each in 1991 and 1996, one case was reported in Qiongzhong County, Hainan Province in 2003, and one case was reported in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province in 2006. None of the cases survived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is alarming is that the doctor also said on Weibo: &quot;I have heard of several cases of cerebral amoeba infection this summer.&quot; A very rare disease broke out in one summer vacation. I have heard several times that it may reflect that primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is increasing. On October 7, 2020, the US &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that &quot;brain-eating worms&quot; are migrating north across the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, purely based on risk, the risk of contracting &quot;brain-eating worms&quot; from wild swimming is currently very low, so don&#39;t scare yourself by taking advantage of it. However, we must pay attention to the serious consequences of infection and the trend that the probability of infection is increasing globally. The case this doctor came into contact with is an important warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until authoritative guidance comes out, the way to prevent infection with &quot;brain-eating worms&quot; is to avoid or minimize swimming in warm, unsterilized rivers, lakes, ponds, hot springs and other natural water bodies. , bathe, wash your face, if necessary, keep your head above the water or wear a nose clip, and be careful to avoid disturbing the sediment layer of lakes or ponds, because there may be a large number of amoeba living in it. If you have any suspicious symptoms such as headache, vomiting, abnormal sense of smell, or fever after swimming, you should seek medical attention immediately. The doctor also reminded on Weibo: Do ​​not swim in natural water bodies because there is a risk of drowning and infection. There is also a risk of infection with schistosomiasis and other parasites in southern rivers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Human beings are social animals, and the natural challenges faced by humans must rely on the power of civilized society to solve them. There is no problem swimming in sterilized tap water, which points to the problem of swimming pool construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every summer vacation, schools always set strict rules, requiring students to stay away from rivers and lakes; various places also strictly guard against it and guard the water surfaces. However, China&#39;s swimming pool construction is still insufficient. Relevant statistics show that the per capita sports venue area in my country is 2.41 square meters, while according to estimates, the per capita sports venue area in rural my country is only 1.15 square meters, less than half of the national average. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, various places are also strengthening the construction of swimming pools to reduce the cost of using swimming pools. Hainan Province has opened swimming pools in primary schools for free during the summer. The relevant person in charge of the safety department of the province’s Department of Education said, “The free opening has further tightened the protective network to prevent student drowning. So far, the total number of student drowning accidents in Hainan Province this summer has been The number of drowning deaths has dropped significantly year-on-year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The construction of swimming pools can be completely adapted to local conditions and does not necessarily have to be of high standards. As long as it is clean and sanitary and has people on duty, it will be good. After two students drowned in July 2022, Tang Huan, a rural physical education teacher at a rural primary school in Hengshan County, Hunan, built a swimming pool at his own expense to teach children swimming and drowning prevention knowledge. During the same summer vacation, in Xintao Village, Zhaixia Town, Yuanzhou District, Yichun City, Jiangxi Province, a pond of more than 400 square meters was transformed into a swimming pool according to local conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children have an innate love for water. Taking the initiative to provide students with a safe and controllable swimming environment can not only avoid drowning and contracting diseases, but also help to draw children away from the screen and into sports. Go in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[中国2022年出生人口956万 二孩占比近4成]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258467]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The National Health Commission today (October 12) released the 2022 Statistical Bulletin on my country’s Health Care Development ( (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Communique&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The total number of diagnosis and treatment visits in 2022 will be 8.42 billion, which is basically the same as the previous year.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Bulletin&quot; shows that the total number of diagnosis and treatment visits in medical and health institutions nationwide in 2022 will be 8.42 billion, which is basically the same as the previous year.
