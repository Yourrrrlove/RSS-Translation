The joint investigation team verified the issues reported by the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the problem that the pile length of some threaded piles constructed by Sanjie Company did not reach the designed pile length. The joint investigation team entrusted a testing agency to carry out drilling and sampling tests on the threaded piles subcontracted by China Construction Eighth Engineering Group Co., Ltd. to Sanjie Company and other units for construction in accordance with relevant specifications, and simultaneously carried out infill geological exploration; it entrusted a professional agency to supervise the whole process and conduct inspections on the quality and safety of the roadbed foundation. Comprehensive Evaluation. Through the infill geological survey of the subgrade base constructed by Sanjie Company, it is shown that the thickness of the granite weathering layer and the fluctuation of the weathering layer interface in this section vary greatly. After on-site inspection and comprehensive analysis and evaluation, the construction pile length of the threaded piles in this subgrade section is consistent with the height and low fluctuations of the bearing layer revealed by the infill geological survey, and the &quot;unable to drive&quot; phenomenon has occurred.

After investigation, when the threaded pile construction did not reach the designed pile length but the pile end entered the bearing layer, the participating units only met on site to confirm and failed to perform design change procedures in accordance with regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After comprehensive investigation and evaluation, the bearing capacity of the composite foundation in the subgrade section as reported by the media meets the engineering requirements, and the stability and post-construction settlement meet the requirements of relevant railway specifications. There are no composite foundation quality problems or safety hazards. It does not affect the safety of railway operations. At the same time, the settlement deformation was observed and evaluated after the completion of the composite foundation. The results showed that the actual measured and evaluated post-construction settlement of the entire Lai-Rong High-speed Railway line met the specification requirements. The acceptance results of the joint debugging and joint testing of the Lai-Rong High-speed Railway and other acceptance results show that the Lai-Rong High-speed Railway meets the track smoothness requirements during the operation of 350km/h high-speed railway and meets the safety and stability requirements of high-speed train operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investigation found that during the construction period, Sanjie Company and China Construction Eighth Engineering Bureau had conflicts in terms of construction progress and project payment. They had withdrawn from the construction in June 2021, and the two parties have not reached an agreement on resolving the disputes. . The investigation also found that there were problems in construction management such as inadequate on-site management and irregular project subcontracting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the investigation conclusion, in response to existing problems in design changes, construction management, project subcontracting, etc., the Shanghai Railway Supervision and Administration Bureau imposed administrative penalties on the relevant responsible units and 7 responsible persons in accordance with the law; in accordance with relevant regulations, The construction unit China Construction Eighth Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd., the supervision unit China Railway Second Institute (Chengdu) Consulting Supervision Co., Ltd., the design unit China Railway Fourth Survey and Design Institute Group Co., Ltd. and the construction unit Shandong Lairong High-speed Railway Co., Ltd.

Casualty accidents and major violations of consumer rights and interests are the minimum things that companies must guard against. Regrettably, these heinous incidents occur every month in the warning events, causing outrage and disgust. I can’t help but ask: Where is the conscience of these business owners and companies who have touched the red line? This is no longer an issue of social responsibility, it is the most basic moral issue of a person or an organization. The selection of corporate social responsibility warning events is of great significance. It reminds us that we must resolutely fight against these bad behaviors and must be persistently committed to awakening our conscience and safeguarding social fairness and justice. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yin Juelin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The outstanding feature of this issue of corporate social responsibility warning events is that many of them involve people’s food, clothing, housing and transportation.

The national &quot;Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Cosmetics&quot; has clearly stipulated that toothpaste shall be managed in accordance with the regulations of ordinary cosmetics; claims of special effects must be evaluated in accordance with national standards and industry standards, and cannot expressly or imply that it has a medical effect. In other words, toothpaste is just an ordinary cosmetic, not a medicine. As a well-known time-honored pharmaceutical company, Pien Tze Huang has certain advantages in entering the toothpaste market, but it should not adopt the mentality of playing on the sidelines. This is both illegal and does not match its industry status as a well-known pharmaceutical company.

First, the company tramples on the basic bottom line of honest management; second, it seriously undermines the seriousness and authenticity of information disclosure, thereby misleading stakeholders, and may even disrupt the normal advancement of ESG information disclosure.

Bottom line. Life is precious. One-sided pursuit of efficiency and profits regardless of the safety and health of employees is an illegal and shameful act, and the circumstances are extremely egregious.

Relevant agencies and regulatory authorities should intensify supervision and law enforcement efforts, continuously and solidly investigate enterprises that have a fluke mentality and lack of regulatory measures in environmental protection, and put an end to negligence in their duties.

However, behind the overwhelming advertising, the bottom line of pharmaceutical product quality has actually failed to be maintained. For a pharmaceutical company, product quality and safety are the bottom line of social responsibility. We hope that this fine of more than 100 million yuan will serve as a wake-up call for the company to strengthen quality control of its product production lines. The problem may be solved in the short term by recalling products, but long-term reflection and rectification are essential. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Top Ten Corporate Social Responsibility Warning Events in October&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1.

Prevention and control work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Notice&quot; pointed out that winter and spring are the seasons with high incidence of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, norovirus gastroenteritis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The current COVID-19 epidemic situation across the country is generally stable, but there is still a risk of a rebound in my country&#39;s COVID-19 epidemic in winter. Since October 2023, influenza and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection activities have gradually increased in my country. It is expected that influenza will have a national epidemic peak in winter and spring, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection will continue to be high in some areas in the future. This winter and next spring, our country may face the superimposed epidemic situation of multiple respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Notice on Preventing and Controlling New Coronavirus Infections and Other Key Infectious Diseases in Winter and Spring&quot; mainly includes 6 key measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, effectively implement port epidemic prevention and control. Ports must strictly implement measures such as temperature monitoring of entry personnel, medical inspections, epidemiological investigations, and medical screening, and carry out new coronavirus mutation monitoring in accordance with regulations. Disease control, health, and customs departments should strengthen data sharing and information exchange, and coordinate risk analysis and prediction and early warning. Strengthen the publicity and interpretation of policies related to active health declaration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to continue to carry out dynamic monitoring and early warning of the epidemic. All localities must coordinate the surveillance of key infectious diseases such as COVID-19, influenza and norovirus gastroenteritis, and closely track changes in the epidemic situation. Strengthen the analysis and utilization of multi-source data such as online direct reporting, fever clinics, sentinel hospitals, laboratory testing, etc., carry out multi-pathogen comprehensive surveillance of acute respiratory infectious diseases based on actual conditions in areas where conditions permit, strengthen the reporting and management of statutory infectious disease information, and ensure information Timeliness and accuracy of reporting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to strengthen the prevention and control of key institutions and key groups. All localities should strengthen prevention and control in elderly care, childcare, schools, social welfare and other institutions as well as confined spaces, and urge daily protection and health monitoring. Strengthen the vaccination of key groups such as the elderly, patients with underlying diseases, and children against COVID-19, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines, and strengthen classified and hierarchical health services and management for vulnerable groups such as the elderly over 65 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is to strengthen preparations for medical treatment. All localities should coordinate the deployment of medical resources based on the epidemic situation of infectious diseases and the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases in winter and spring, and strengthen the production and supply of relevant treatment drugs. Dynamically monitor the supply situation of retail pharmacies, medical institutions, especially primary-level medical supplies, and strengthen the guarantee of appropriate dosage forms for children&#39;s medication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fifth is to continue to strengthen science popularization and education. All localities must continue to provide health education and publicity guidance, make full use of various media at all levels to carry out publicity and policy interpretation on the prevention and control of COVID-19 and other key infectious diseases in winter and spring, and release epidemic and prevention and control information in a timely, accurate and objective manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sixth is to strengthen organizational leadership and responsibility implementation. All localities must strengthen the organization and leadership of infectious disease prevention and control in winter and spring, maintain a moderate and orderly prevention and control intensity and rhythm, maintain the effective operation of joint prevention and control mechanisms at all levels, be prepared for transition from emergency to emergency, and report promptly once clustered epidemics are discovered. , quick response and effective disposal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电影《我本是高山》陷争议旋涡：“传记片难拍”其实是个世界性难题丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261192]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the movie &quot;I am a mountain&quot; adapted from the real deeds of Zhang Guimei, the principal of Huaping Girls&#39; High School, was screened It triggered a wave of online scolding. Some viewers who watched the on-demand screening expressed dissatisfaction, accusing the film online of being &quot;misogynistic&quot; and &quot;smearing Principal Zhang&#39;s beliefs.&quot; In response, the screenwriter responded on social media with &quot;Your grandma, I was born to be a mountain&quot; and also Responding to critics with &quot;Mediocre gully! Humble coward!&quot; also triggered a war of words and controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The disputes between the two parties probably focus on two parts. The first is the discrepancy between the plot and reality. Critics believe that many plots violate real history, such as &quot;Girls go to Internet cafes to stop studying because they fell in love while shopping&quot;, &quot;Principal Zhang forced girls to cut their hair short&quot;, &quot;Principal Zhang looks similar in appearance but not in spirit, like a chicken baby and a tiger mother&quot;; secondly, Regarding &quot;gender issues&quot;, critics believe that &quot;it is the father who is alcoholic, not the mother in the film&quot; and &quot;Principal Zhang insists on running the school because of his faith, not because he misses his deceased husband in the film&quot;, and then accuses the screenwriter and director of &quot;misogyny&quot; Discredit Principal Zhang’s faith.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the controversies encountered by &quot;I Am a Mountain&quot; are similar to those encountered by biographical films on a global scale. These two major controversies can also be reduced to &quot;issues of fact&quot; and &quot;issues of fact&quot;. A question of values”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of film art, &quot;biopics are difficult to make&quot; is actually a global problem, and eye-catching biopics are rare around the world. Especially for celebrities who are very recent, it is indeed difficult to make a biographical film commercially and artistically while respecting the facts. There is no other reason. Celebrities’ life stories are widely known. Any artistic processing and adaptation will inevitably reshape the celebrity’s public image and challenge the audience’s inherent perception of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as this &quot;factual issue&quot; is concerned, the decision-making power on how to collect materials, write scripts, and start shooting should be left entirely to the screenwriter and director. As long as the legal authorization of celebrities and their families is obtained and the potential for infringement is eliminated, the plot adaptation is actually not difficult, and it is purely a matter of choice and judgment in film art. If the director thinks that he cannot get the adaptation permission he wants, he can decide on his own whether to continue filming. For example, Gao Xiaosong gave up the idea of ​​filming the movie &quot;Lin Huiyin&quot; because &quot;Lin Huiyin&#39;s descendants requested that Xu Zhimo not be included.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although many biopics are completely loyal to real history, they have become a piece of history because they dare not let go of adaptation. The failure of &quot;Jobs&quot; falls into this category. The life of the Apple Godfather was filmed in a lukewarm manner; Many biopics hope to make breakthroughs in commerciality and artistry, but they have more or less fallen into the &quot;controversy&quot; and are under certain pressure from reputation. For example, &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; added an &quot;original plot&quot; and was fictional. The controversial plot of Turing, the father of computers, &quot;gives up reporting on fellow Soviet spies in order to prevent his homosexual identity from being exposed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for &quot;I Am a Mountain&quot;, Principal Zhang Guimei and other real people did not object to the screenwriter and director&#39;s processing and adaptation, but only appeared at the screening to say, &quot;I didn&#39;t really think anything of it at the time. how&quot;. Therefore, the film&#39;s factual issues cannot be considered a point of contention. The reason why the online scolding war was triggered was because of the second controversial point - &quot;the issue of values.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Critics believe that there are &quot;gender issues&quot; in the film, such as &quot;the mother is the drunkard, which vilifies women&quot; and &quot;the original theme was female awakening and female independence, but in the end it became the deceased husband of Principal Zhang &quot;Touched&quot; &quot;Girls skipping class, going shopping and falling in love are also vilifying women&quot;; and &quot;China Film Report&quot; sided with the screenwriters and gave an explanation that Principal Zhang not only saved the girl, but also saved the mother and allowed her to study in China. Ping Girls&#39; High School has started a new life, which is obviously the narrative of &quot;Girls help girls&quot; (GHG). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is not a phenomenon unique to Chinese movies. The same plot has long appeared in Hollywood movies. &amp;nbsp; &quot;Identity politics&quot; has been entangled in the American literary and artistic circles for many years, so that every movie has Americans spend a lot of energy discussing &quot;whether people with specific identities are given enough roles&quot; and &quot;whether specific groups are vilified&quot;. In the end, every time Hollywood releases information about a new film, people will joke that &quot;the skin color of the protagonist has already been determined.&quot; , and also send a funny P picture of the protagonist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facts have proved that this &quot;American political correctness&quot; itself has gone beyond the discussion of art, but has become a complete choice of sides, which has caused harm to the artistic value of movies. If the audience&#39;s focus on a movie should be on &quot;whether it vilifies certain groups&quot; and &quot;whether certain groups have roles&quot; instead of whether the movie itself is good-looking or not and what its artistic value is, then I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s definitely not the luck of the film practitioners. , will also make film criticism out of focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oscar winner Alex Gibney believes that biographical films need to have a unique, sharp and novel angle, otherwise it will be difficult to succeed because of &quot;packing in a lot of big ideas&quot;. The 2016 movie &quot;The First Lady&quot; starring Kennedy&#39;s wife Jacqueline suffered a disastrous box office failure. The reason was not a gender issue, but the lack of skills of the screenwriter and director, who failed to star Natalie Portman. Jacqueline stepped out of the &quot;iconic shell&quot; that Americans are familiar with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is the freedom of the director and screenwriter to express whatever truth they want to express. If the film is forced to comply with certain &quot;progressive issues&quot; and &quot;identity politics&quot;, then it will probably bring more artistic value to the film. Big damage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“两极分化的印度”，“捡跑侠”难解垃圾顽疾]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261174]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In Delhi, India, 34-year-old marathon runner Beverly is used to picking up garbage at her feet while jogging.

Seeing Beverly do this, his friends join in. &quot;I want to change people&#39;s mindset - littering on the road is our responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beverley is known as India&#39;s first &#39;picker&#39;. He created a set of &quot;trash workouts&quot; that he said could effectively exercise participants&#39; muscles and bones.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Beverly&#39;s demonstration, this set of actions included squats, bows, and squats. Steps, stretches, duck steps, biceps and triceps curls, shoulders and back. If it weren’t for the recyclable trash bag on your shoulder and the discarded plastic box and straw in your hand, this would look like It is a common morning exercise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the years, Beverly and her friends have launched many “pick-up and run” activities. The largest one was the “RElan&amp;nbsp;Trash-Free India” from September to November 2019 &quot;Long-distance running&quot; was also the activity that impressed Beverley most. In 50 days, Beverley ran in 50 cities in India, covering a distance of 1,000 kilometers on foot.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At that time, Modi The Prime Minister called me and said that the Indian government will do this with us. Today, with the support of the Indian government, more than 10 million Indians have participated in this movement. &quot;It is no accident that Beverly launched the pick-up and run activity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as September 2014, Indian Prime Minister Modi announced a &quot;Clean India Campaign&quot; plan, calling on Indian citizens to create a &quot;clean India.&quot; He also called on, &quot;Everyone spends at least 100 hours cleaning every year. We can no longer tolerate India being dirty. &quot;On October 2, 2014, Modi personally came to a gathering area of ​​cleaning workers in New Delhi, the capital, picked up a broom and cleaned the road.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, on August 29, 2019, the Indian National Sports On the same day, Modi also launched a &quot;Fit India Movement&quot; campaign to call on and encourage people to prioritize exercise and fitness in their daily lives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bev Lee &quot;picks up and runs&quot; in the marathon (photo provided by interviewee)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/c59267463a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0 &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/c59267463a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259439&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beverley &quot;picks up and runs&quot; in the marathon.

Reduced. This has actually been a &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; for some cities. &quot;During the epidemic, the garbage and pollution situation in Delhi was much better. Because of the lockdown at home, private cars did not go out, and the air quality was also good. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Mu Kejie has moved to near Mumbai. In his opinion, the sanitation facilities in many cities in India have improved significantly in recent years. For example, it was rare to see trash cans and garbage trucks on the road before. . And now &quot;trash cans are widely deployed in cities.&quot; Moreover, garbage trucks transfer garbage every day, and the garbage of that day will not accumulate near the home for a long time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, more sanitation &quot;stubborn problems&quot; remain Stay in the city.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Mu Kejie visited a landfill in Delhi, which left a bad impression on him. &quot;The experience was particularly bad. &quot;He recalled that the garbage in the landfill was not processed, and many people went to pick up the garbage and sell it to others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The government has proposed to solve these garbage problems, but there has been no progress. ” He said.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The “stubborn disease” of municipal waste&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2016, a fire broke out in the Deonar landfill near Mumbai, which burned for several months, causing smog in Mumbai all day long.

The Washington Post compared the landfill to &quot;the city&#39;s silent killer&quot; and &quot;a toxic time bomb.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, in 2023 On March 2, a &quot;garbage mountain&quot; caught fire again in Cochin, Kerala, southern India. The resulting thick smoke and toxic gas filled the sky over the city, causing residents to choke and cough, and many schools were forced to close... A week later , the fire has not been completely extinguished.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If street garbage is only an eyesore, then large-scale landfills located on the edge of cities have become &quot;public nuisances&quot; everywhere, threatening the safety of the urban environment and the health of residents. During the decomposition or decay process of large amounts of garbage and waste, toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide will be released, causing fire hazards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, Modi announced the &quot;Clean India Campaign&quot; vigorously advocated by the government &quot; has officially entered the second phase. This time, the government&#39;s work focuses on the two themes of &quot;garbage-free cities&quot; and comprehensive purification of urban water sources. According to reports, the Modi government plans to invest approximately 1.41 trillion in &quot;Clean India Movement 2.0&quot; rupees (approximately 120 billion yuan).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his public speech, Modi also &quot;named&quot; the Gazipur garbage dump that has troubled Delhi for many years, promising that such &quot;garbage mountains&quot; will be completely eliminated in the future. be removed. India will build a series of landfills and sewage treatment plants to gradually replace the open landfill treatment method, effectively improve the urban environment, and create &quot;green jobs&quot;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Modi The ambitions are high, but the reality is a little cruel.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A 2020 survey by the New Delhi-based non-profit organization &quot;Center for Science and Environment&quot; showed that there are as many as 3,159 large-scale &quot;garbage mountains&quot; in India, and the hoarded The total weight of garbage reaches 800 million tons. The scale and quantity of waste left behind in these landfills has become a &quot;ticking time bomb&quot; and has related environmental impacts, including air, water and soil pollution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, The landfill in Deonar, a suburb of Mumbai, India, has exceeded 16 million tons, with the highest mountain height reaching 36.5 meters and covering an area of ​​more than 120 hectares.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gan Gan, a person in charge of the &quot;Science and Environment Center&quot; Shyam said that the government&#39;s environmental plan may still be feasible in small and medium-sized cities, but the existing super landfill waste in large cities is too large and difficult to be &quot;digested&quot; by artificial means.&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; “Solid waste management is a global issue. Every city in the world is struggling with it. Regarding the garbage mountain on the edge of Delhi&#39;s city, Beverley said helplessly that some cities are good at managing garbage problems, but Delhi has not been able to manage it effectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Delhi Municipal Corporation is formulating a plan to Reduce and hopefully eliminate these mountains of waste through appropriate disposal methods, including waste-to-energy. &quot; He added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the difficulty of disposal, &quot;urban waste&quot; is also related to the livelihood of many poor people in India. If the Indian government completely cleans up these landfills, millions of &quot;living on the mountain&quot; will &quot;The scavengers are afraid of losing their livelihood.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Mu Kejie&#39;s hometown of Calcutta, he saw many scavengers who made a living by picking up garbage. These people picked up recyclable bottles and used clothes. They have also received help from some public welfare organizations. &quot;Some of them are very young, in their twenties and thirties, and they come out to scavenge because they can&#39;t find jobs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Scavenger&quot; Beverly also proposed that scavenging Collectors are an important group in the clean-up movement, saying they play an important role in helping to recycle large amounts of waste, especially PET plastic bottles. He said, &quot;Many NGOs are working with waste pickers and they should get more recognition and better working conditions. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data disclosed by Indian media, there are approximately 1.5 million to 4 million people working in garbage dumps across India. Most of them are from humble backgrounds, have no decent education, and have few skills. According to international According to data from the non-profit organization Save the Children, in New Delhi, the capital of India, at least 10,000 waste pickers are children.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, due to the lack of urban garbage collection services, a large amount of garbage currently generated in India is left unprocessed. is dumped into landfills, rivers or oceans. On the one hand, India is not well equipped to deal with its current waste. On the other hand, with its rapidly expanding economy, the country&#39;s waste generation is expected to grow exponentially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As media comments said, Indian policymakers currently need to turn their attention to waste and adopt &quot;a stronger commitment to deal with waste management issues.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多地儿科告急！“儿科荒”何时能破]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261215]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/24/GA9G1ObTEyVuxMRK7aUkIRm9AspyiGzacV4JqMBw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;677&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/GA9G1ObTEyVuxMRK7aUkIRm9AspyiGzacV4Jq MBw. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259520&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Outside the pediatric clinic of a tertiary hospital in Beijing&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Photo provided by the interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A packed pediatric clinic&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 12, a patient returned from the pediatric emergency room That night, Lin Ling bought a folding stool online. Earlier in the day, she had stood outside the emergency room for more than five hours. She didn&#39;t know whether the child would have a recurrence of the disease in the future, so she had to prepare for a rainy day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Ling’s son suddenly had a fever after lunch. Always active, he first reclined on the sofa, and soon climbed into bed and curled up. Lin Ling quickly took her ear temperature - 38.5°C. Considering that recently some children in schools and interest classes have taken leave due to mycoplasma pneumonia, Lin Ling&#39;s heart is tight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Ling’s family lives in Chaoyang District, Beijing. The peak period of mycoplasma infections in Beijing is usually from September to November, and the situation in 2023 is different from previous years. In early November, Yin Yudong, deputy chief physician of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, said in an interview with the Beijing News that under normal circumstances, the weather in late winter is too cold and dry, and the survival of mycoplasma will be restricted. However, due to mycoplasma infections in the past few years, There are too few patients, and the peak incidence this year may be extended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, influenza-like illness cases and positive influenza tests are also increasing. Xu Baoping, director of the Respiratory Department of Beijing Children&#39;s Hospital, said in an interview with CCTV News that the viruses currently detected include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Lin Ling gave the child antipyretic medicine, he quickly went to the platform to register. She is used to going to a tertiary general hospital near her home. The number of outpatient clinics for the day has been exhausted, but emergency services will be opened at 5 p.m. When she arrived at the emergency room, the doctor had not yet arrived, and there was already a long queue at the door of the clinic. The queue formed a U-shape along the narrow aisle. Lin Ling&#39;s registration number is 36, but unlike the clinics she is familiar with, this place does not use the registration method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An experienced parent explained to newcomers, &quot;Usually there are few people coming here to see the emergency department. When they come, they just go to see the emergency department without calling the number. There are too many sick children during this period.&quot; However, the medical system has not been changed so quickly, and we still only have to wait in line. Moreover, after queuing up to get a blood test order, you have to re-queue to see the results.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Families with sufficient medical attendants often adopt this method. &quot;Team battle&quot; strategy: Arrange two people to line up one at a time, one at a time, and a few people apart. When the person in front arrives, he will take the child to see a doctor first, and issue a blood test order to draw blood. After about 15 minutes, the results will come out, and the second person will follow soon. When the time comes, take your child to the doctor to see the results and wait for the next treatment plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the most efficient. Of course, the &quot;top match&quot; strategy also requires the introduction of a third person. Otherwise, the adults in the queue would have to ask people in front and behind to help reserve seats from time to time, and then rush to the distance to check on the sick child sitting alone on the chair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s okay to raise a child. It&#39;s just Mr. Fei. Even a child is like this. I admire you two-child families.&quot; The two mothers chatted, and one of them brought two children to the emergency room. There are also such examples around Lin Ling. The young son of one of her friends was infected with mycoplasma. In order to avoid infecting the eldest daughter, the grandmother had to stay in a hotel with her grandson for a whole week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/rc77rmNoZqQosf3kCs1OpN7qBwI41OnfUPZis3NS.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;1333&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/rc77rmNoZqQosf3kCs1OpN7qBwI41OnfUPZis3NS.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259523&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the evening of November 12, 2023, parents and children were waiting at the door of the pediatric emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Beijing &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Photo provided by the interviewee /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a staff member in the aisle wearing a blue vest with the words &quot;Chaoyang Mass&quot; printed on it. Because parents queued for too long, he would go to the queue every once in a while to ask if there were any children whose temperatures had not been taken for a long time. If a child&#39;s temperature is too high, has sudden symptoms, or has underlying diseases, he will take the child to &quot;jump in line&quot; and find a doctor for early diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parents who complained about process optimization to no avail and could only stand and wait began to share their experiences of taking their children to see a doctor these days. Some of them have been transferred to two or three hospitals; some children have been taking cephalosporins and azithromycin for several days, but their fevers cannot be relieved; some test results are normal, but they have high fever and constant coughing; some children have taken various medicines for half a month, but their symptoms are gone. Well, a rash started to appear instead... A parent behind Lin Ling took out his mobile phone to check the pediatric emergency room of another nearby tertiary hospital. The mini program reminded him that it would take at least 6 hours to get to the emergency room there. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the conversation, Lin Ling learned that compared with children’s specialist hospitals, general hospitals have slightly fewer people, but some parents still prefer to stay close to them. Many of them have often visited several hospitals. The child has been in treatment for some time. However, in their view, there are still many &quot;unclear&quot; aspects of this round of infection. For example, the diagnosis cannot be made clearly based on the test results or chest X-ray alone, or the treatment effect is not good after taking medicine for several days. Some parents can only place their hope. The specialized hospital has seen more cases and can make a clear diagnosis, so that the child will suffer less. &quot;It is just to have less trouble.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly three hours later, Lin Ling&#39;s child finally A blood test was done and it was confirmed that it was a bacterial infection. Lin Ling breathed a sigh of relief, &quot;At least I understand.&quot; Because the white blood cells increased significantly and the child was not in good spirits, the doctor prescribed an infusion order. The pediatric infusion room in the emergency room is not spacious. In order to make room for the children undergoing infusion, parents can only stand by the seats and wait. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was mid-term exam week. Lin Ling saw a junior high school-looking child with a stack of information on her knees. She was holding an injection in one hand and writing and drawing on the paper with the other hand. There was a mobile phone next to her. Online classes are playing. Another girl was in fourth or fifth grade. After the infusion, she insisted that the nurse pull out the indwelling needle. &quot;We&#39;ll talk about the injection tomorrow. It&#39;s inconvenient to write with this needle.&quot; The girl came with a schoolbag on her back, and her mother stayed by her side. The girl was diagnosed with mycoplasma pneumonia, and the doctor asked for a three-day sick leave, but the mother and daughter insisted on only issuing a leave note for physical education classes. &quot;There are midterm exams on Wednesday and Thursday,&quot; the girl said. While queuing up, Lin Ling learned that when classes resume after taking leave due to illness, the school will require relevant certification documents. There are many parents who choose to send their children to school while sick. &quot;This is also one of the reasons why cross-infection occurs easily in schools.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;It was already past 10 pm when Lin Ling left the infusion room with her child. Walking through the still bustling corridor, Lin Ling glanced at the busy clinic. The long night of the doctor on duty has not yet begun, where she will see patients non-stop until early the next morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Not many choices&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Faced with his daughter’s sudden cough and fever, Li Ang, who lives in Beijing, adopted a different strategy from Lin Ling. She avoided the overcrowded children&#39;s specialty hospital and the tertiary general hospital, and chose a tertiary hospital near her home for initial consultation, follow-up consultation, and switching from traditional Chinese medicine to western medicine. After going in and out of the hospital three times a week, Li Ang herself began to experience symptoms such as sore throat and nasal congestion. And her daughter’s journey of consultation continues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/JJtyFeJ2KfxYAZWGTZEycitylEMvCjOeSa9vSoNX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;654&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/JJtyFeJ2KfxYAZWGTZEycitylEMvCjOeSa9vSoNX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259522&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Patients and their families waiting for CT scans in a tertiary hospital in Beijing&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;According to Li Ang, the pediatric department of this tertiary hospital has two doctors on weekdays, one each from traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors will prescribe traditional Chinese medicine granules according to the child&#39;s condition. Due to the good curative effect, Li Ang&#39;s daughter usually comes to this Chinese medicine doctor for headaches, brain fever, and excessive food intake. For this triage, she also chose Chinese medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequent laboratory tests showed: blood routine was normal, mycoplasma antigen was negative, and influenza A and B antigens were negative. Taking into account the relative delay in the emergence of mycoplasma antibodies, the doctor decided to treat the child as &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection&quot; after observing the child&#39;s symptoms. He diagnosed the child as &quot;phlegm-dampness invading the lungs&quot; and &quot;respiratory tract infection&quot; and prescribed azithromycin and traditional Chinese medicine granules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking the medicine for two days, Li Ang&#39;s daughter&#39;s body temperature still did not drop. It usually remained below 37.5℃ in the morning and approached 38℃ in the afternoon and evening. At the same time, there would be severe coughing every few minutes during the day, and symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea also appeared. Li Ang quickly contacted the Chinese medicine doctor who prescribed the medicine online, and the other party suggested adding an antipyretic Chinese patent medicine. That day, the child&#39;s body temperature finally dropped below 37°C. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of November 20, when Li Ang brought his daughter to the pediatrician for a follow-up consultation, there were obviously more people waiting for the consultation. She learned from the triage nurse that there were only three or four medical staff in the department, and they usually saw 50 or 60 patients a day. Recently, they saw 100 patients every day, and another 20 or 30 patients were needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because diarrhea and nausea were suspected to be adverse reactions of azithromycin, the doctor believed that he had taken enough for three days and could stop taking the medicine. He also prescribed five pairs of traditional Chinese medicine granules for relieving cough and reducing phlegm and a Western medicine for reducing phlegm. Three days later, Li Ang&#39;s daughter&#39;s symptoms improved a lot and she was finally able to resume classes. After going to school for a few days, my daughter felt a little tired when she came home every day, and her coughing sound was quite heavy. It sounded like there was a lot of phlegm in her throat, but she couldn&#39;t cough it out, so she had to take another leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this period, Li Ang checked the diagnosis and treatment plans of some recent related cases online and found that this wave of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections has the characteristics of long course, easy recurrence, strong drug resistance and the possibility of developing severe disease. When words such as &quot;nebulization, hanging bottle, hospitalization, lung washing&quot; frequently popped up in front of his eyes, Li Ang began to worry that his daughter was at risk of developing pneumonia, and decided to follow up for a follow-up visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She originally considered changing to a tertiary tertiary hospital, but after checking three or four tertiary hospitals for pediatrics, all the appointments for the past week were full, and she was worried about cross-infection when she went to the emergency room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 23, she could only go to the tertiary hospital where she had been treated for the third time. This time she chose Western medicine. After auscultation, the doctor recommended a CT scan to rule out pneumonia. But here comes the problem. The pediatric department of this hospital cannot infuse infusions. If there is a problem with the film, you have to go to another hospital for infusion treatment. So the doctor suggested that the child should be given aerosol treatment first. If the condition does not improve, then go to a pediatrician in a hospital that can infuse for a CT scan. This tertiary hospital has a limited number of atomizing equipment, but there are many patients waiting for treatment. To avoid cross-infection, the nurse suggested that Li Ang buy a home atomizing machine himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These days, Li Ang has been paying attention to the relevant information and expert interviews about this round of respiratory infectious diseases. He only feels that &quot;everyone has his own thing to say&quot; and &quot;the more he reads, the more confused he becomes.&quot; This feeling seems familiar. At the end of 2022, she also experienced various twists and turns of taking the elderly at home to the emergency room for medical treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/AUNCnAgIQx7rZZ0uXJnEbNXorW9LK0vgf9RwHcG8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/AUNCnAgIQx7rZZ0uXJnEbNXorW9LK0vgf9RwHcG8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259518&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 23, 2023, in a children&#39;s hospital in Beijing, parents and children waited in the outpatient department&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of the 24th, she came across a &quot;Children&#39;s Mycoplasma Pneumonia Course &amp;amp; Medication Chart&quot; published by &quot;Beijing Daily&quot;, which wrote: &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the antibody test and chest imaging results. , judging by the drop in body temperature and the improvement of symptoms.&quot; &quot;The fever is gone and only the cough is - it&#39;s not a big problem, it means that the recovery is getting better.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After several days of messages, she finally saw a message that could Information that reassured her a little. At least using body temperature as the main criterion, my daughter is recovering. But this peace of mind was still fragile, so she finally got a job at a maternal and child health hospital, where the pediatric department could take CT scans and infusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 21, Li Yuchuan, director of the outpatient department of Beijing Children’s Hospital, told CCTV that the hospital’s internal medicine department currently receives more than 7,000 patients per day, far exceeding the hospital’s capacity. &quot;Currently, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus have replaced mycoplasma and become the main pathogens at this peak of infection.&quot; Li Yuchuan suggested that parents of children with the disease should provide daily care for their children and do not need to send them to the doctor if necessary; if necessary, If you go to the hospital for treatment, you can also do your own etiological examination first to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment. At present, the seriousness rate of respiratory tract infections is not high. Parents of children with the disease can seek medical treatment online through the Internet to understand the condition and apply appropriate medicines. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Behind the Pediatric Overdraft&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Different from the situation encountered by Lin Ling, Lu Xin The children&#39;s hospital in the area has launched a self-service billing service before diagnosis in mid-2023. High-frequency testing items including five categories of blood routine, urine routine, C-reactive protein, mycoplasma, influenza and other high-frequency testing items can be completed while waiting in line for self-service billing and payment. This initiative has reduced ineffective waiting time, but even so, the local pediatric department is still overcrowded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The emergency waiting time at the Children&#39;s Hospital in Suzhou is several hours, and the waiting time for hospitalization may be more than a week. Many patients are diverted, and even the pediatric departments of private hospitals are overcrowded. The daily outpatient volume of pediatric outpatients in our health center is also overcrowded. Above 150.&quot; On November 23, after a busy morning, Lu Xin finally squeezed out a little lunch break to be interviewed by Southern People Weekly. He works as a pediatrician in a township health center in Jiangsu Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Lu Xin’s observation, the local cases of mycoplasma pneumonia infection have been on the rise since the summer vacation. They began to increase significantly in September. In November, there were mixed infections of influenza A and B. Since September, Lu Xin has not only not had a day off, but his night shift has also been extended. Previously, if there was an emergency at night, Lu Xin would see the doctor from 8 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., then take a 3-hour break before starting duty until 8 a.m. the next day. Now that the number of children is increasing rapidly, Lu Xin will continue to sit in the clinic until 11:30 noon after finishing the night shift, and then go home to rest. &quot;I will try my best to limit each patient&#39;s consultation time to three minutes. If it is longer, it will be too long to finish.&quot; Lu Xin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the confusion Lin Ling heard from parents about the &quot;unclear&quot; symptoms, Lu Xin believed that part of it was caused by &quot;drug resistance.&quot; &quot;At present, our local cases are quite &#39;understanding&#39;. According to the situation we receive, a large number of children&#39;s coughs are caused by mycoplasma infection. Sometimes, because the Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibodies appear later, several more tests are needed. Diagnosis. After being diagnosed, some children are still difficult to cure after taking azithromycin. Medication options for those over 8 years old, especially for adults, will be wider, but at present, azithromycin is actually widely used for mycoplasma infections in children under 8 years old.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/gC73ECOTcuwUHcKsh0CvCnzi9qTVeO9h7pB4f6pr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot; 720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/gC73ECOTcuwUHcKsh0CvCnzi9qTVeO9h7pB4f6pr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259519&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 18, 2023, in the emergency room of a children&#39;s outpatient clinic of a hospital in Shanghai, patients, children and parents came to see the patient&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Resistance has always been the main reason affecting the effectiveness of mycoplasma treatment, but it has attracted widespread attention from the outside world this year.&quot; China has the highest macrolide resistance rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the world In the country, this proportion reaches 60%-70% among adult patients and more than 80% among pediatric patients, Yin Yudong once mentioned in an interview with the Beijing News. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2023 version of the &quot;Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Mycoplasma Pneumonia in Children&quot; released by the National Health Commission in February 2023 mentions the usage of azithromycin: &quot;For mild cases, 10 mg/kg/d, qd, orally or Intravenous infusion, the course of treatment is 3 days, which can be extended to 5 days if necessary; or 10 mg/kg/d, qd on the first day, and then 5 mg/kg/d, for 4 days. In severe MPP, azithromycin is recommended for intravenous infusion, 10 mg/kg/d, qd. , use it continuously for about 7 days, and start the second course of treatment after an interval of 3-4 days. The total course of treatment depends on the condition, most of which is 2-3 courses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This means that the recommended medication time for mycoplasma pneumonia It has advanced from three or four days to five to seven days now,&quot; Lu Xin said. Judging from the medical admissions in the past few months, Lu Xin has indeed come into contact with many children who are resistant to azithromycin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lu Xin’s view, there are many topics worthy of long-term attention behind the recent surge in pediatric outpatient and emergency visits in some places, far exceeding the capacity of hospitals and departments. In addition to continuing to implement and improve the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system and improving the diagnosis and treatment capabilities of primary medical and health institutions for general infections and the efficiency of severe disease identification and referral, the old problem of long-term shortage of pediatric medical resources has once again attracted widespread attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Lu Xin believes that from a local perspective in Suzhou, many children infected in this round can be properly treated in community hospitals or township hospitals, and there is no problem that the examination cannot be done or the drugs are not available. situation, but he also admitted that even in Jiangsu Province, which has developed medical resources, not all primary hospitals are equipped with specialized pediatricians. This is also the problem Li Ang encountered this time. The community hospital near her home currently does not offer pediatrics. She avoided crowded tertiary-level hospitals and specialized hospitals and chose tertiary-level hospitals with relatively few patients. However, the lack of medical equipment and means made diagnosis and treatment more difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The fundamental reason why it is difficult for children to see a doctor is that there are too few pediatricians.” In an interview with the People’s Daily in 2017, he was then vice president of the Pediatrician Branch of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association and Party Committee of the Capital Institute of Pediatrics. Deputy Secretary Yang Jian said that compared with developed countries, the number of pediatricians in our country is not enough. With the liberalization of the two-child policy, the number of children has increased, and the shortage of pediatricians has become more prominent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there is a chain of contempt among hospital departments, pediatrics must be at the end. From the perspective of economic benefits alone, pediatrics have fewer examinations and less medication. &quot;For hospitals, Western medicines and consumables are all 0 price difference, and Chinese herbal medicines will have some bonuses. Pediatric medications are based on body weight and the dosage is small. In terms of examinations, daily Basically, it is a routine blood test, and in special cases, a chest X-ray is required. Not only is the income low, but the efficiency is also low. Children cannot express their condition relatively accurately like adults. The time it takes to see a pediatric patient is equivalent to seeing three or four internal medicine patients. Sometimes if it is not handled well, it will lead to quarrels and complaints from parents,&quot; Lu Xin said frankly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pediatrics has always been one of the departments with a high incidence of medical disputes. &quot;People in the industry often laugh at themselves. Pediatrics is like scolding every three days and beating every seven days.&quot; Li Mo, who majored in clinical medicine, changed careers many years ago. It was only half a year after she entered the pediatric department of a hospital in Beijing. &quot;I have forgotten how I received that slap. I only remember that I felt wronged. That slap shattered my medical dream. Because of the love for their children, it is easy for parents to lose their minds in pediatrics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Mo believes that being unable to accept the working status of &quot;having no money and being beaten and beaten&quot; is an important reason why pediatricians, including her, choose to change careers. In 2022, a male classmate of hers during her master&#39;s degree also resigned from pediatrics. &quot;After working for 15 years, I still haven&#39;t persisted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A doctor&#39;s income is roughly linked to the department&#39;s diagnosis and treatment performance. &quot;Pediatrics can&#39;t make money.&quot; When it comes to money, it often loses money because the hospital still has to invest in warehousing and manpower,&quot; Lu Xin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Profitability affects income levels, which in turn hinders the improvement in the quality and quantity of pediatrician resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the reform of higher education in 1998, the undergraduate major of medical school eliminated the pediatric major and replaced it with the clinical medical major. The major of pediatrics was not subdivided until the postgraduate level. In 1999, the national pediatric major stopped enrolling students. The original intention of the policy adjustment was to improve the learning of general medical knowledge, but due to the low overall attractiveness of pediatrics, more graduates who choose pediatrics are relatively low-ranking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If departments like pediatrics and emergency departments, which are tiring, hard-working and have little money, want to attract talents and reverse the talent gap, the most direct stimulus is to increase the investment of resources in the departments. Increase the income of medical staff in the department. However, the current strategy is to reduce the scores for the postgraduate entrance examination and practicing physician examination in pediatrics. The hospital’s recruitment conditions for pediatric medical staff are also looser than those for adult departments. However, the actual effect is not good, and pediatrics is still short of people. , because the crux of the problem has not been solved.&quot; Lu Xin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2015, the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress voted to pass the amendment to the Population and Family Planning Law, and the universal two-child policy will be officially implemented on January 1, 2016. In 2016, after years of appeals from all parties, the National Health and Family Planning Commission coordinated with the Ministry of Education to resume undergraduate enrollment in pediatrics. The &quot;2015 China Health Statistics Yearbook&quot; shows that in the past five years, the total number of pediatricians in China has dropped from 105,000 to 100,000, with an average of only 0.43 pediatricians per 1,000 children, which is comparable to the national average of 2.06 physicians per 1,000 people. Farther than that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The training of doctors takes a long time. The causes and constraints of the &quot;pediatrics shortage&quot; are complex and cannot be solved quickly by resuming enrollment. Lu Xin can only hope that the shortcomings in pediatric resources exposed this winter will draw continued attention from the public and policymakers to the inherent problems in this field and provide more help to alleviate the problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the National Health Commission issued the &quot;Implementation Plan of the National Health Commission on Implementing the Outline for the Development of Women and Children in China from 2021 to 2030.&quot; The plan points out that by 2030, there will be 1.12 pediatric practicing (assistant) doctors per 1,000 children, and the number of beds will increase to 3.17. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Lin Ling, Li Ang, and Lu Xin are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
