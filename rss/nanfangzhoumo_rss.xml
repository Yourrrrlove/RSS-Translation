The Hexi Corridor-Tianshan area is not only located in the north-south dividing zone on the extension line of the Great Wall, but also serves as the east-west passage from the Central Plains to the Western Regions. It is not only the isolation zone that separates the nomadic peoples of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Mongolian Plateau, but also the transition zone between the &quot;Hexi Granary&quot; farming area in Gansu and the nomadic areas in Qinghai. So it is not a line, but a &quot;crossroads&quot; where north-south and east-west cross each other. Historically, on a larger scale, the Central Plains empire and the nomadic peoples confronted, interacted, and constructed each other around elastic borders, forming a &quot;dual system of agriculture and animal husbandry.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/2AxxXkUyWxYpZQLp6CWVYr3JONTnePlG8YtOgNSz.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height= &quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/2AxxXkUyWxYpZQLp6CWVYr3JONTnePlG8YtOgNSz.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;March 2022, Jiayuguan, Gansu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/0dFpcu08D0aNI47Ww7cMuGs7iQO0nsmsTgUiADYZ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/0dFpcu08D0aNI47Ww7cMuGs7iQO0nsmsTgUiADYZ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203980&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;October 2019, Gansu Gaotai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/2aSsHvTcfiV1Bsh3qdVHWBZC7wXL5uXnt2OEHBpr.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/22/08/05/2aSsHvTcfiV1Bsh3qdVHWBZC7wXL5uXnt2OEHBpr.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203989&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;March 2020, Jinchang, Gansu&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;The Hexi Corridor I photographed has such a unique objective geographical location and its historical and geographical status is particularly important. area, so the Hexi under the lens is not only a realistic geography, but also a geography with historical participation and influence.

Stills from &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; (2023). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;You can have your own name&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>; Starting from early September 2023, two films known as meta-movies have appeared in theaters: Liu Jiayin&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a Worth It&quot; and Wei Shujun&#39;s &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;. Previous theaters in China include Zhang Yimou&#39;s &quot;One Second&quot;, Dapeng&#39;s &quot;Good Luck&quot;, Malaysia&#39;s Tan Cui Mei&#39;s &quot;Barbarian Invasion&quot;... Wei Shujun&#39;s next film &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is also said to be a meta film. The so-called meta-movies are generally considered to be &quot;movies about movies.&quot; Such films are often full of reflections on film creation and film operating mechanisms. They often have a theoretical flavor that explores film texts. Nowadays, they appear so densely in movie theaters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to the age of film maturity. With unlimited communication, high-speed transmission, and rapid and easy access to visual means, the world has become a huge studio. In such an era, the distance between ordinary audiences and meta-movies has been greatly reduced. People are more familiar than ever with how movies work. Although these recently released films still lag behind other commercial films in terms of acceptance, their appearance in theaters can already be discussed as cultural phenomena. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; and &quot;Stories from Yong&#39;an Town&quot; are named meta-movies, they are actually not intentional by the creators. They just filmed their own life and work experiences. out. Since they are all filmmakers, they are all caught up in confusion about movies. When they express their confusion, the movie naturally becomes a meta-movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wonderful thing is that the moment when you express your confusion is also the moment when your confusion is solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last film &quot;Cowhide 2&quot; directed by Liu Jiayin was completed in 2009, fourteen years ago. &quot;Cowhide 1&quot; was shortlisted for the Berlin International Film Festival and won an award, and &quot;Cowhide 2&quot; was shortlisted for the Cannes Directors&#39; Fortnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourteen years of &quot;creative blankness&quot; must mean huge pressure for a filmmaker. Moreover, she is teaching at a film school and is surrounded by actors who are engaged in film creation. I often ask her, when will your next film be released? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; expresses this pressure in an implicit way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very unique film. I remember that avant-garde experimental novels in the past sometimes did this - turning all the depression the author felt in life into the depression of the reader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director also knew that this was a risk, but everything was well thought out. The protagonist of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; - Wen Shan, played by Hu Ge, used to be a very unsuccessful screenwriter, and now writes memorial messages for people in a funeral home. He is very serious and responsible for his clients, and often gets into the emotional entanglement between the client and the deceased with a pedantic touch. Understanding the world and writing the right eulogy may be the goodness in his mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Lei plays Xiao Yin, a young man who lives in the same house as Wen Shan. The character is set up to be weird and ethereal. In the second half of the film, the audience suddenly realized that he was a semi-finished product, a movie character that Wen Shan, the screenwriter, had been trying to create for many years. When Wen Shan was hesitant or unsure about his creation, Xiao Yin&#39;s way of existence and sense of existence became vague and uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Yin also kept asking Wen Shan, you must face your situation sincerely! He is Wenshan&#39;s alter ego - which is logical. When Wenshan smokes, he also smokes, but he only has one set of clothes. He always wears the same jacket and hat, and he never grows a beard - this is because Wenshan did not really create him . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wen Shan, who had gone through countless mental struggles, finally confidently said to Xiao Yin one day, &quot;You can have your own name,&quot; I heard a low exclamation burst from the middle of the audience. This low exclamation occurred in the screening hall of Beijing Film Academy, which was the place where I watched this film for the second time. Most of the audience are film students and filmmakers who are engaged in creative work, so they can better understand this relationship. Of course, I believe that those who make a career out of writing will understand the subtleties and thrills involved, and at the same time recall all the hardships they endured while creating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That one movie moment almost brought me to tears. How much training does it take to create a fictional character? This not only requires the talent of the creator, but also other opportunities. A character&#39;s dystocia may come from the creator&#39;s deep mental quagmire for many years. He or she may have lost self-confidence and the courage to express. Sometimes it also comes from external pressure, the industry&#39;s unique norms and access systems, and evaluations. The chaos of the system makes creators lose confidence in creation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A Journey Worth It&quot; depicts and reflects on a very profound profile of the film creation process, revealing the subtleties of creation. Although the plot of Wen Shan writing a memorial speech takes the longest time to show in this film, what I think is the most touching is the deep affection between Wen Shan and his movie characters that contains fear. This film was able to win the Best Director and Best Actor at the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival. It seems that the inner world Liu Jiayin implanted in the film was still felt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A Worthwhile Journey&quot; shows an area that is not easily perceived and expressed. One detail in the film impressed me deeply: when Wen Shan was working and typing in front of the computer, the inertia of the input method made some unpleasant names often pop up on the screen. These names were the names of characters he had failed to write successfully as a screenwriter. . Although they were not born, these names were often used by Wenshan, and finally the input method remembered them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;In Yongan Town, will nothing happen?&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The reflection on the movie in &quot;Yongan Town Stories&quot; focuses more on the interpersonal level , is also more social. Although this film without the participation of top stars may not receive a high box office compared to &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, it does not prevent it from being an equally talented film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This film is also autobiographical. The film was inspired by Wei Shujun&#39;s experience filming his second feature film in Hunan three years ago. It is very similar to the plot shown in &quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; - in Hunan, the screenwriter and director had a conflict in the script concept. After running in, the final effect was not good, and later the two decided to overturn it and start over. This main plot was transplanted into &quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, Wei Shujun&#39;s last film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; (2020) is also a meta film. Both films reflect on the filmmaking process, including the studio ecology, such as filmmakers’ arrogance, chaotic work order, inappropriate power relationships in creation, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; discusses the correspondence between film narrative and the real world in more depth than &quot;Wild Horses Part Mane&quot;: How does the movie tell the story of Yong&#39;an Town? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three-part structure of the film, at the beginning of the first part, the documentary director behind the scenes is waiting for the crew at the door of the hotel. He wants to record everything that happens to the crew. The crew entered Yong&#39;an Town, and the director and screenwriter came together. After settling in, some people said that Yong&#39;an Town has a peaceful beauty. The screenwriter said, doesn’t this reflect people’s powerlessness? As it says in my script - nothing will happen in Yong&#39;an Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;“Nothing will happen in Yongan Town” is a theme that the screenwriter constantly emphasizes in his scripts, which reflects his understanding and judgment of Yongan Town. However, the director did not agree with the screenwriter&#39;s judgment and asked the screenwriter to make modifications based on realistic logic and character logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major contradiction quickly emerged. The director and screenwriter are competing for the right to interpret Yong&#39;an Town, or the right to interpret reality. Wing On became a symbol of reality itself. The development and unfolding of this contradiction will eventually be realized in: &quot;In Yong&#39;an Town, will nothing happen?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first paragraph, a landlady who provides food for the crew appears. The proprietress is often accompanied by an old woman. The old woman sits in the shop like a sculpture. It seems to be in line with the screenwriter&#39;s imagination of Yong&#39;an Town: stationary, losing mobility, and nothing will happen to her. Once, the screenwriter met the boss’s wife and asked her to recite his wise words in dialect. When the boss’s wife said, “Nothing will happen in Yong’an Town,” the screenwriter laughed happily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the old woman who had been motionless suddenly moved her aging body out of her original position with the help of a chair with wheels. This scene happened quietly, but it seemed to prove that something &quot;happened&quot;. This scene delicately reflects the cultural hegemony and certain transgression of artists (such as screenwriters) over local people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is the attitude of the movie? Will nothing happen in Yongan Town? The young proprietress is breastfeeding, and her husband works as an online ride-hailing driver, leaving her to take care of the child at night. During the day, she also helps her parents-in-law manage the restaurant, which is the family business she will inherit in the future. This woman was firmly imprisoned in this family structure, and it seemed that nothing would happen to her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She was excited by the arrival of the crew, and she saw a new possibility - she made a prompt decision, weaned her child, and went to the street to get a manicure. This was her action. But the producer quickly brought in the female star Chen Chen to play the role that the boss lady longed for. Her movie dream was shattered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the boss lady&#39;s actions were unsuccessful, she cannot deny the power of action she once had. However, the unsuccessful ending is a serious blow to the actors. Such a small town story is indeed unable to inspire people&#39;s action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protagonist of the second paragraph, the female star Chen Chen, actually walked out of Yongan Town. Chen Chen was warmly welcomed by her old classmates, but she did not enjoy the feeling of being respected. She was &quot;kidnapped&quot; to cut ribbons for others for free. The local officials were vulgar and had no respect for women. What made Chen Chen feel cordial was his old friend Chen Hong. Chen Hong&#39;s wife invited her to have dinner at home, but this meal put Chen Chen in an embarrassing situation. The other party actually wanted to use her as a back door to send their children to the crew to be actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Hong and his wife are played by Yang Jin and Wang Jiajia, who are also husband and wife in reality. Wang Jiajia portrays a middle-aged woman in a small town very vividly. She is vulgar and shrewd, and successfully ruins the relationship between her husband and his old lover. All the good feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chen fled from this swamp-like family in a hurry. She said to her old classmate: &quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to become like this!&quot; Chen Hong said: &quot;You said you missed life here during the day! You are famous now Didn&#39;t you just leave because of money?&quot; Chen Chen said, &quot;The reason why I left was because I didn&#39;t want to live like your wife!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The screenwriter believed that Chen Chen left Yong&#39;an Town just for money. Rather than a female awakening, Chen Hong&#39;s explanation for Chen Chen&#39;s behavior was actually the same as the screenwriter&#39;s. It can be seen that the screenwriter&#39;s understanding of life is not entirely based on subjective assumptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Chen Chen defended herself, saying that she left because of her awakening. These are two interpretations of Yongan Town. The voices of the two Yongan Town residents are the voices of Yongan Town itself, which means that Yongan Town itself is a chaotic and sticky place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the same external target, why do the two main creators have such different views? The third paragraph focuses on the two main creators who have been arguing and begins to analyze the source of their differences in concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Screenwriters like hand-rolled cigarettes, but directors don’t like hand-rolled cigarettes. They attack each other&#39;s music hobbies. The director likes RAP and pursues Spike Lee&#39;s style. The screenwriter thinks that those who like RAP are just pretending. They sing to show how awesome they are. He prefers rock and classical music. When the director played Chopin&#39;s music, the screenwriter said, &quot;As soon as this music played, I felt like I was in Yong&#39;an Town.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The screenwriter wrote about a boy chasing a girl playing the violin and arriving at her building. But there was no action at the end. The director thought it was too literary, and the characters could not do without action. The screenwriter said that this story is his experience, and he once chased girls like this. &quot;The life I understand is that people don&#39;t take so many actions! They live by expectations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone has a strong ego and feels that the signal received by the antenna above their head Most accurate. This movie wrote a paper called &quot;On the Origin of Differences in Creative Concepts&quot; in a perceptual way, maybe more than one. The third paragraph actually gives part of the answer. The difference comes from experience and temperament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The screenwriter rewrote the script based on the exchange between the two, but the director found that the script was riddled with holes and completely lost its filming value. They threw the script on the floor and lost their minds. At this moment when the conflict was heating up, the director did not seek to resolve the conflict head-on, but designed a moment of metaphysical transcendence. At this time, the WeChat ringtone rang, and everyone received the same news: Maradona was dead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The music of &quot;Don&#39;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; enveloped everyone, including Chen Hong and his wife, and the hotel proprietress. Everyone transcended and sublimated at that moment, and the contradictions in the script were obviously transcended. Unsolved is better than solved. The main creators wanted to solve the problems of this film creation in a higher dimension. They decided to overthrow it and start over. The end of the film was the opening ceremony of the film &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; and they started a new film. action. They channeled the conflict between director and screenwriter into their new film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/0DiAOLGk9Wx2g67iGWbS9SbBOKB3s1fCfUsq3cq5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;657&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/0DiAOLGk9Wx2g67iGWbS9SbBOKB3s1fCfUsq3cq5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252161&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; tells the story of a crew stationed in Yong&#39;an Town to shoot a movie. Stills from &quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; (2021). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Does the movie faithfully represent reality? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wei Shujun’s ability to control narrative can not only bring the narrative in depth, but also quickly break away and transcend. This degree of control and narrative balance reflect a rare talent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; creates a textual maze. The film features four or five directors in roles, and three sections are titled after several Chinese arthouse films. Behind every director, there are their works and texts, and intertextual relationships can be formed between texts. This contains a certain amount of interest. Do you want to interpret it in depth? Of course you can, but the arrangement and combination of texts will create a kind of textual abyss. Perhaps a vague association will suffice here. The most important thing is the &quot;skill&quot; part of &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called era of film maturity means that film works have been textualized. The connotation of replacing &quot;work&quot; with &quot;text&quot; is a comprehensive reflection and questioning of traditional creative concepts. The work means the close correspondence between the author and the work, the work and reality, the author and reality, etc. That relationship is now being called into question. Does the movie faithfully represent reality? The producer constantly interferes and influences the creation. Is the director really the author of the film? Is the director staying true to reality? Or does he have the ability to accurately understand life? Film production has a strong impurity that can spiral out of control at any time. This can be seen as the inspiration of &quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meta-movies are the textual movies mentioned above. This concept is actually not translated well enough, but let’s use it that way, and what I want to discuss here is a new large-scale trend in the field of Chinese film. How do we evaluate this trend? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Shujun&#39;s last film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; was also a meta film. I remember some commentators thought that the director was too narcissistic. They shouted to Wei Shujun - there is more to life than movies! I understand the commentator&#39;s attitude, but I think it pathologizes Wei Shujun&#39;s creative tendencies. I don&#39;t want to see it this way. As for &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot;, although it is a meta-movie that captures the director&#39;s own life, it also contains profound social analysis and social criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The age of film maturity does not only mean that people have watched enough films, are familiar with film history, film allusions, and understand the mystery of intertextuality; it also does not only refer to their life time and film in a broad sense. There are more overlaps and more daily communication through the form of movies in a broad sense... What’s more, we are already familiar with the cultural mechanisms of films, from studio production to ideological operating mechanisms; it means that at the moment, technology and media The &quot;wave of self-imaging&quot; brought to us by the development of the Internet has swept through each of our lives and reconstructed the organizational form and experience mode of our lives - think about the comeback of private images, think about Douyin and folk promotions The spontaneous performance of the actor...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The age of film maturity is also when all film forms seem to have been exhausted. People are rethinking the possibilities of film, including rethinking the development of new technologies, and rethinking film and reality. The relationship between... We are already in an era of intense film reflection and new film ontology, which constructs a new cultural spirit of our time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; and &quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; have clues about the creator&#39;s original life that can be traced, but they also have the macro background of an era when movies are mature. Although these films are full of self-reference and discussion of the ontology of film, they are not outside of historical time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[做人生转折时刻的强者：不作无谓的精神消耗，而是活在意义之中]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257940]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;People have different attitudes and approaches when encountering major turning points. Most people panic and are in a dilemma. In contrast, the narrative of a Weibo blogger gives people a refreshing and enlightening feeling, which is quite enlightening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Weibo blogger recounted that her husband’s unemployment happened suddenly. In the morning, he was still complaining about too many people on the subway and was a few minutes late. Then he sent her a message saying: I was in a meeting and something was wrong. Condition. It turned out that after their project was launched, there were so many bad reviews that his boss was completely heartbroken. After a weekend of thinking, he decided to dissolve the company immediately. While there was still money in the company&#39;s books, more than 200 people in the company were given N+1 Everyone rushes towards their own future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course this is a responsible boss who treats his employees well enough, but for the workers, the bleak ending is already a fact. Her first reaction was that although the incident was sudden, unemployment was a foregone conclusion and she needed to plan for the next step immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Their rent in Beijing just ends on September 30. She came to his company to confirm: disbandment is a foregone conclusion. After completing the formalities today, she won’t have to go to work tomorrow. She got N+1 beautifully. The two then spent 10 minutes analyzing the pros and cons, and decided to discuss it with the landlord, quit the rent on the 30th, and move back to Chengdu before the National Day. Next, he went to resign, and she contacted the landlord and the agent, explained the situation, and went through the check-in procedures for the two cats. She also immediately placed an order for the cartons, tape, plastic wrap and other things needed for the move and had them delivered in the same city. Then I announced to my close friends that I was leaving Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the standard performance of a time management master: when he left the company at 15:00, she had already made a list of what things at home needed to be unused and what things should be kept for return to Chengdu. . At 17:00, the agent came to take photos. She canceled her flight and hotel booking to Seoul for the weekend and rebooked her flight back to Chengdu. Around 19:00, she was already posting like crazy in the community’s idle group. At 20:00, she called two other more experienced good friends to help her husband revise his resume and teach him interview experience for the next job, because he had not moved around since graduation and had no experience in finding a job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is my attitude towards life. Now that I have decided, there is no need to delay for one more second. Look forward, the sooner the better.&quot; Her emotion triggered the reaction of many netizens. Sadness and sympathy. In the face of such a thrilling fate, how could a person calmly make a handover with fate in just a few minutes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 years ago, I once &quot;drifted to the North&quot; for several months. In order to compete for a position in a magazine, for a whole month, I went from &quot;audition&quot; to &quot;audition&quot; among hundreds of people. Semi-finals&quot; and even the 4-person &quot;finals&quot;. When I finally lost my job opportunity with another &quot;unlucky guy&quot; because I didn&#39;t have a college degree, I was immersed in the emotions of shock, dissatisfaction, and unwillingness. It took a long time before I hesitated and went south in frustration. Compared with this &quot;time management master&quot;&#39;s never-procrastinating style, I am really ashamed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are always disappointments in life, and unemployment is just one of them. When people reach middle age, some people get divorced, lose their spouses, lose their close friends, or encounter other unfortunate things. It’s not surprising to feel down and up and down at this point. So people often advise &quot;caged people&quot; to go out and relax. It has to be said that traveling far away does help to relieve the mood. However, regardless of whether you have the intention to go out, even if you go out, the troubles hanging in the air will continue to affect your mood. Didn’t you see that some of the wanderers became even more depressed after they came back? Therefore, this method of shelving conflicts and pain and adjusting time and space is not the best solution. The best solution is actually &quot;long-term pain is worse than short-term pain&quot;, do whatever you need to do, and never be sloppy or indecisive. The aforementioned blogger set an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Objectively, because the blogger was mentally prepared and built up for her husband&#39;s unemployment, instead of being suddenly laid off, when the moment did come, the blow he suffered was naturally less severe. What&#39;s more, since the compensation can be described as generous, it has also greatly relieved the bitter taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this is not the key reason why he can maintain a calm and free style in times of turmoil. The key reason is to &quot;cut through the mess with a quick knife.&quot; Whether it is dealing with large or small matters and trivial matters, or making an immediate decision to move, it all reflects the philosophy of using speed to make things easier, and using pain to get rid of pain. Turning pages so quickly can minimize the impact of shock. Selling away most of the company-related artifacts is also to erase traces of the old job as soon as possible and reduce memory trauma. It is conceivable that at that time, their minds were occupied with other important things, so how could they squeeze in the pain? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be thought from this that modern people are greatly superior to the ancients in terms of material living conditions. But why does it seem that our stress is much greater than that of people in the past? Why do so many people seem to be depressed today? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, today we are indeed in a state of &quot;volume&quot; in many affairs, and pressure exists objectively, but have we ever thought about this problem: The ancients were often busy planning for rice every day, and rarely did they have to worry about it. I have free time to think about things, so much so that I have to &quot;steal&quot; even &quot;half a day&#39;s free time&quot;. Nowadays, people have more leisure in a materially rich environment. Once people are free, it is easy to get stuck in a corner and be unable to get out, amplifying the pressure. In fact, today, our situation is much better. For example, although the journey to school is extremely difficult, fortunately, examination or selection information is becoming more and more transparent, and at least there is certainty after studying hard, which is much better than in the past when imposters and secret operations were frequent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, leisure and non-idle are only relative, and how to deal with problems in specific circumstances also varies from person to person. However, no matter what era you are in, if you want to get out of trouble, people are given requirements and needs. The tactics adopted are actually the same, that is, the more extraordinary the period, the more meaningful things to do and the more meaningful issues to think about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you become stronger in this changing situation because of your timely stop loss and seeking changes, how heavy will the troubles of a person in a unit be? When a person can make himself bigger and stronger at the macro level of life - for example, becoming a person with a skill in his spare time and establishing extraordinary influence in a certain field - at this time, in a small space, because of interpersonal relationships and Can the waves caused by income disputes have a fatal impact on him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically speaking, in the context of life transitions, it means not to consume unnecessary energy, but to live in meaning. On the basis of acknowledging reality, turn around quickly and move from one state of affairs (stage) to the other as quickly as possible. Entering another state of affairs (stage), self-stimulating upward courage, it is too late and there is no time to feel sorry for yourself. This is the &quot;sharp weapon&quot; that the strong keep secret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 20:25:21 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戴佩妮：写歌根本就是老天爷要我做的事情]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258000]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/xDUbigKtQgtDIq3lncCbMYixioK3gMnfPWRa24AO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/xDUbigKtQgtDIq3lncCbMYixioK3gMnfPWRa2 4AO. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252435&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Penny Dai in &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the program team)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chinese music scene in 2000, a 22-year-old girl made her debut by releasing an album with original songs. In the mature record industry system What are the chances of finding a way out? Dai Penni told the audience through her actions that she might not be able to become an instant hit, but her talent will be recognized. The proof of this is the &quot;Nomination for the Best Newcomer Award at the 12th Golden Melody Awards.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the time since his debut was extended to 23 years, and the purely original album was released to his 13th, the singer entered another evaluation system, which consists of various criteria such as persistence, resilience, and having ideas. It seems that he can Separated from worldly judgments such as market and sales, the base is stacked with time and works. The &quot;status in the world&quot; shows the scarcity of music and the longevity of talent. Dai Penni is firmly on top, resting in a corner. She said: &quot;Writing songs is basically what God wants me to do.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She seems to have been accustomed to her situation: writing some songs that dig deeper into herself, and having a stable group of people who work with her The fans who grew up lived a contented life. As she said: &quot;I have always been a nobody, living a life where second place doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Dai&#39;s most popular clips on the Internet were presented by fans in an almost joking way. A few years ago, she sang her masterpiece &quot;How&quot; live, and handed the microphone to a fan. The other fan grabbed the picture, went out of tune, and burst out laughing in the middle of the song. She was stunned, took back the microphone, and finished singing this sad love song while holding her thighs. After singing, she was not annoyed and told the other party gently: &quot;Feixiang &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(fan&#39;s name)&lt;/span>;, keep up with the time.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;This less than two-minute clip was made into various videos and emoticons and went viral on various platforms. It was dubbed by some media as &quot;probably the most popular day since Dai Penny&#39;s debut.&quot; Until now, many people have seen Dai Penny staring at fans with complicated expressions, but they have not listened to the full song &quot;How&quot; she sang at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Dai’s life is littered with similar jokes of fate: she has written hundreds of songs, but still can’t read music. Her explanation for this was: &quot;This is a talent and a mission.&quot; She made up her mind to enter the music scene, and the first song she released was called &quot;Don&#39;t Want to&quot;. She was nominated for the Golden Melody Award for Best Female Singer many times, but she missed it every time and always regretted it. The album that finally won the award was called &quot;Purely Accident.&quot; She loves female singer Ani DiFranco. This pioneer in the original music industry has a unique personality and follows absolute DIY principles. He founded a record company to release his own solo album. Since his debut, he has been competing with the mainstream because of his clear views and controversy. While yearning for it, Dai Penni wrote about her endless self and subtle emotions in her songs, becoming part of the mainstream - being two extremes from being an idol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing that is good about original singers is that the audience does not have to work hard to outline the singer&#39;s mood and story from the twists and turns of lyrics and music, especially for a creator like Dai Penni, who uses direct or indirect life experience as a Based on the original creation, the expression is strong and direct. &quot;My songs are my diaries,&quot; she said. With more than a dozen albums arranged by year, Dai Penni has been along the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at Dai Penny&#39;s music career, we can find that she is really full of energy. In addition to her dozen albums and hundreds of songs, she also has a large amount of unreleased inventory. In 2011, she gathered her friends to form the rock band Buddha Jump Over the Wall, serving as the lead singer. With her first album &quot;Buddha Jump&quot;, she was nominated for the Best Band Award at the 23rd Golden Melody Awards; her second album &quot;Show You&quot; won the 2015 Golden Melody Awards. Won the Best Arranger and Best Orchestra awards. She helped write lyrics and music for Peng Jiahui, Xu Guanghan, Pingguan, Jiang Meiqi, Liu Sihan and others. She won the Best Album Producer Award at the 25th Golden Melody Awards for the album &quot;Embrace You&quot; produced for Liu Sihan. In addition, she has also served as music video director and album photographer. Before her debut, she once wanted to become a professional dancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Tai was born into a scholarly family in Malaysia and started learning dance in the fourth grade of primary school. In high school, she participated in the first music competition in her life. She adapted a text written by a friend into a song and made it to the finals. The winner of that competition was later musician A Niu, and Leung Jingru won the Best Performance Award. Also participating were Zhang Zhicheng and Fang Jiongbin, who later became Dai Penny&#39;s few friends in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Dai Penni participated in the recording of Hunan Satellite TV&#39;s program &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;. In the previous four episodes, she invited her friend Zhang Zhicheng, who competed with her, and producer Yaya, who has been working with her for many years. She said that she doesn’t have many friends, but if anyone needs her, she will definitely stand up. “My loyalty can be exaggerated, and sometimes I forget that I am a girl.” In the program, they looked back on the past and pulled back the time to a long time ago. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the competition in high school, she caught the attention of musicians Chen Zihong and Huang Yi, signed up to &quot;Like Music&quot;, and released her first solo album &quot;Penny&quot; the following year. Until the release of her second album &quot;How&quot;, she had not decided whether to be a singer-songwriter or a professional dancer in the future. The song &quot;The Love You Want&quot; from the album was recommended by the company as the ending song for the TV series &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; and resounded throughout the streets as the TV series became popular. As she walked on the street, audience members came to say hello, &quot;For the first time, I felt like I was recognized by everyone because of my music.&quot; The energy of this song lasted for many years, and it is still one of her masterpieces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Dai’s music has rich genres and diverse emotions, which is one of her attractive features. She said: &quot;I&#39;m really vulnerable when I&#39;m vulnerable. I can be soft and strong. I don&#39;t hold back. I cry when I need to cry, feel sad when I need to be sad, and be fierce when I need to be fierce. Just like my lyrics, these Song just cut me open for you to see, without reservation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/nVi6rXdNtNPN8bTDlIET40hATrkyb30SMVgcJdlW .jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/nVi6rXdNtNPN8bTDlIET40hATrkyb30SMVgcJdlW.jpg&quot; data-key =&quot;252432&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;, Dai Penni and her friend Zhang Zhicheng sang &quot;Three O&#39;clock in the Morning&quot;&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Provided by the program team/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Every song of mine has a secret - Dialogue with Dai Penni&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you participate in the recording of &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was a flying guest in the first season and sang a cover of &quot;Coward&quot;. In fact, I was very afraid of singing the cover. But the atmosphere was very warm at the time, and Mr. Arai’s team was also very good. I was also invited to be a flying guest in the second season, but I missed it because I had Yang. This season is &quot;Friends&quot;, and the content has been changed to find your best friends, which attracts me even more. Through this program, I can let everyone know more about my friends who have been on the music road for more than 20 years and how they have helped and influenced me. I have very little exposure and rarely talk to people about these things. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not afraid of strangers and make friends easily. But until now, since I debuted, I have very few real good friends as an artist. Most of them are the staff behind the scenes, the producers, costumers, etc. who shoot the MV. Stylist, makeup artist, music teacher, so I also want to use this show to make friends and learn about other musicians’ musical journeys. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/BF0w2SdlxmEpTSofejPSmEzZ3N3prWLOD7UhKyo1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height= &quot;523&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/BF0w2SdlxmEpTSofejPSmEzZ3N3prWLOD7UhKyo1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252431&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Penny&#39;s first full creation in 2000&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly: &lt; /strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is it because we rarely become friends with artists because we have less opportunities to chat? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have some bad experiences. As long as I treat the other person as a friend, I will stand up for the other person when they need me. I will definitely show up. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not very clingy with my friends. The friends we met in the early days were not like today. Now everyone makes friends through Moments, but the content shared in Moments may not necessarily be what he really wants to say. I don’t reject the idea of ​​a circle of friends. I used to have a circle of friends, but I rarely posted them. I was always looking at them. As I watched them, I began to speculate or worry about the other person (whether something was wrong). I felt that this was actually not very healthy. Gradually, I followed my previous approach and closed the circle of friends. If you have anything to say, we&#39;ll talk to you face to face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am both passive and active, and I am very willing to take the initiative to help others, but if he doesn&#39;t mention it or doesn&#39;t let me know, I will feel that he doesn&#39;t need me at this moment, and I don&#39;t need to be too &quot;chicken bitch&quot; , I have to take care of others. The friends around me now will come to me if they really need some advice, but I don’t think I need to be so enthusiastic that I can take the initiative to ask. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TxAvFrk8RV2VqY6CM4ElzKo5Q8OQKF0DqhIvX47D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;536&quot; height= &quot;746&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TxAvFrk8RV2VqY6CM4ElzKo5Q8OQKF0DqhIvX47D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252437&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Purely Accident&quot; 2013&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/ strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When will this mentality change be completed? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2017, I wrote &quot;Passive Audience&quot;.

I rarely go out. Why aren’t my things being shared on social media? It’s because I feel bored. I’m not practicing or eating well at home. I won’t share who my friends are over the years. I am very protective of my circle of friends and my life, because for me, my life is my creation. Well... my songwriting is already a part of my life. From my debut until now, people have been guessing my appearance through my songs. This is natural. &quot;A person who doesn&#39;t often share too much about his life.&quot; In the circle I live in, it may be very contradictory for a person who wants to be exposed or publicized, but I just have this kind of rebellious personality. I don’t think this environment can only accept the existence of one type of artist or one type of business model. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ICY90xMKpkkZtKafCIbLZwq7whvIOCsxqivBS2IT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 540&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ICY90xMKpkkZtKafCIbLZwq7whvIOCsxqivBS2IT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252429&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Passive Audience&quot; 2022&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Characters Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If you don’t want to expose your personal life, there are quite a few reality show parts in this show, and there are a lot of self-revealing parts. .

I will not take the initiative to tell everyone that I am in the show every day. Why, but when I meet fate and meet friends, I will talk freely. So this goes back to what I just said, I am not afraid of strangers or making friends, I am very willing to share. It’s just that I use music to share more than making friends to sit down and share with everyone. My life is my music, but I don’t want to just use social media to share my life. I hope I can find a more appropriate platform. I think this program is a very comfortable platform to talk about music. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have written all the most important things in the song, and I have already cut myself open enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the content written by some singer-songwriters may not necessarily be their own (experiences), but I choose to be a narrative singer-songwriter. I feel that I feel deeply and I only write when I have something to say. That&#39;s why I tell everyone that my songs are my diaries. I don’t like keeping diaries, but I love writing songs. Every song has people, things, things, and every song has secrets that you don’t know, yes, only I know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What does secret mean? For example, what&#39;s the secret in &quot;The Love You Want&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It refers to a lot of code words in words, which are things that only I understand. &quot;The Love You Want&quot; is relatively straightforward. The funniest thing about it is that the big boy in this song is actually me. It was a very young love affair, and I was too strictly controlled, so I wanted to be like a big boy and be free. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in fact its story is not what you think, it is the other way around, but no one knows it. As the person who sings it, everyone will definitely think that I have met a boy who wants to be free. No. But I don’t want to explain this thoroughly. It’s like some movies where you don’t know whether the ending is happy or bad. In fact, it’s an open ending, and many things just need to be stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;How&quot; is obviously a touching love song, but it was changed into another style by a handsome fan friend of mine, and I didn&#39;t expect this change. I didn&#39;t know it at all. This change will occur. But I am loyal to the reason why I wrote this song in the first place. The changes in my life and things will not affect the picture in my mind when I sing this song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people are worried that I can no longer sing this song, no. When I sang this song, I knew what secrets I was hiding. I knew the time, place, and people. Of course, there would still be funny scenes when we talked about it, but it would not affect the reason why I wrote this song in the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you think you have improved in writing lyrics and music over the years? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it is the time that has given me different perspectives on things and different interpretations, and the words I use are different. So for me it’s not just aging, it’s maturing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t know how to use the word “nurture” before. Later, I heard a senior say that I think this word is very good, because different environments will cultivate different personalities. . Therefore, the word &quot;nurture&quot; has been used frequently in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was only after I finished the song &quot;Passive Audience&quot; that I learned to make peace with myself and often have meetings with myself. I was often in a state of binary opposition before. I would be worried about a lot of things at once, and I couldn&#39;t find the answers, so I started asking people for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wrote the song &quot;I Yearn&quot; in the album to remind myself. I have participated in so many programs in the past three years, and I am very afraid that I will go astray and forget my original intention. So I wrote this song to remember what I yearned for, &quot;The days I yearn for have sunrises, and the mess I yearn for is taken care of by you.&quot; By the second paragraph, I started writing and realized that my mentality had changed, so this song The song is to remind yourself not to get lost by filling in the gaps in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said you couldn’t make a decision before, so you started asking people everywhere, But your songs show that you seem to be a very courageous person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Things that are bold are very bold, and things that are not bold are not bold. I am very decisive now when it comes to big things. Now I use very unscientific methods to make decisions, such as throwing coins. My life is destined to be good, and the more I think about it, the less likely it will be. My whole life has been unintentional. I can only sum it up with this sentence. At the age of 45, from the beginning I didn’t want to be a singer-songwriter and just gave it a try, and now I have followed this path, and it feels like I was destined to do it. If the first album doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;m going to go back to dancing or something, no, it&#39;s just going to be like this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can only admit that this is my mission. There are many people who can sing well, look good, and can create better than me, but not everyone can eat this. Have a meal. What makes me happiest is that my hobby is my job. I do things that interest me every day. At the same time, I can empower others through song, or give them a place to find release. This is the identity belt I have now. It gives me, supports me, and is the main reason why I still want to come out and sing and chat with everyone no matter how tired I am. Because this is basically what God wants me to do. If he didn&#39;t want me to do it, he would have asked me to go home and dance on the first album (after the album). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/xkHR1nMNeASpTkionE5GrJKnAOtgxeTdAMM8TkMs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/xkHR1nMNeASpTkionE5GrJKnAOtgxeTdAMM8TkMs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252433&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;, Dai Penni plays games with Yu Wenwen (left) and Meng Jia (right)&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Provided by the program team/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If this It is a kind of mission.

A country, just within these five hundred miles, has staged the ups and downs of its national destiny from rise to decline, from glory to annihilation. Sometimes, history can not only be examined with time, but also measured with space...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Congtai&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Climb high and have a bird&#39;s eye view, the lake lingers. In early autumn, the leaves of the wood are slightly yellow, and under the morning sun, their slender shadows wade across the lake and fall towards the square tower. The tower and the corridors at both ends are shaped like a giant bow. ——This reminds people of the several-meter-high statue in the square a few hundred meters away, also holding a bow. What&#39;s even more interesting is that when I walked into the blue-brick paved terrace, I saw that there was also a statue in the corner of the terrace, depicting the same person, also holding a bow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This man was once the master of this square tower, this city, and this vast land. He is the founder of the glorious history of Zhao State: King Zhao Wuling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/02/23/SUG0kgzgaydIkLLurgUzAZf3TVhKEoQy8BrWm0hb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1370&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/02/23/SUG0kgzgaydIkLLurgUzAZf3TVhKEoQy8BrWm0hb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;225541&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The statue of King Zhao Wuling in Congtai Square, Handan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During my visit to the Zhao ruins, I was reminded several times of British scholar John Keegan&#39;s conclusion in &quot;History of War&quot;: Kings are created by great war horses. Although he is talking about the king of the West, King Zhao Wuling, the Eastern monarch, was also created by war horses. Of course, in addition to the war horse, there is another thing that must be added, and that is the bow in his hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three families were divided into Jin, and Zhao State had the largest territory and was also the most remote. Its main territory is in central and northern Shanxi, northern Henan, and southern Hebei. When talking with Fei Yi, King Wuling of Zhao said, &quot;Today, our country has the river and Boluo River in the east, which is shared with Qi and Zhongshan... From Changshan to Dai and Shangdang, there are the borders of Yan and Donghu in the east, and the borders of Donghu in the west. Bordering Loufan, Qin and Han.&quot; - A section of the ancient Zhangshui River in the eastern part of Zhao State bounded by the Yellow River and Boluoshui (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; in present-day Hebei Julu&lt;/span>;) serves as the border with Qi State and Zhongshan State; from Changshan to Daijun and Shangdang, it borders Yan State and Donghu State to the east, and Loufan, Qin State and South Korea to the west. From this point of view, Zhao was surrounded by the Qi, Zhongshan, Yan, Han, Qin and other princes, as well as the Donghu, Loufan and other tribes. If Daliang, the capital of Wei, is a city with four wars, then Zhao State is even more unfortunate. The entire country is a country with four wars - enemies are eyeing on all sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to achieve long-term peace and stability with strong enemies around. Especially under the law of the jungle where the strong bullies the weak and the masses bully the mob. King Wuling of Zhao sighed sadly all night long. He said, &quot;Today Zhongshan is in my heart. There are Yan in the north, Hu in the east, Linhu and Loufan in the west. If there are no strong soldiers on the border of Qin and Han, the country will be destroyed. What can I do?&quot; ?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you are poor, you want to change. This is the driving force for the princes in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods to compete for reform and self-improvement. King Zhao Wuling was no exception. So, there was Hufu riding and shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boundary between the monsoon area and the non-monsoon area is also the 400 mm equal precipitation line, which runs through the northern border of Zhao State. Zhao State is at the end of agricultural civilization and adjacent to nomadic civilization, especially Dai County of Zhao State. , and even closer to the nomads. The advantage of this proximity is that Zhao can obtain horses more easily than other princes. Before the industrial revolution, horses were mankind&#39;s most powerful and reliable source of power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The disadvantages are also obvious. Once the climate becomes dry and the pastures wither, it will be difficult for the nomads in non-monsoon areas to survive, and they will have no choice but to go south to plunder. At the beginning of the founding of Zhao State, it often faced intrusions from Donghu and other tribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reforms of King Wuling of Zhao surprised the people at the time - he ordered to learn from these barbarians who often invaded Zhao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The speed and maneuverability of horses are not only incomparable to humans, but also to chariots. Moreover, in the era of King Zhao Wuling, the early aristocratic competitive chariot battles had evolved into a bloody and cruel life-and-death fight. The bulky chariots and the war ethics of not drumming and not rowing had long been unable to meet the needs of the times. Therefore, the heavy infantry represented by Wei Wuzu of Wei State came to prominence. However, the hoplites marched too slowly and had insufficient impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What King Wuling of Zhao thought was that if the soldiers were allowed to ride on flying horses like the Hu people, and shoot and charge on the horses, the mobility and flexibility of the army would be greatly improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest problem is that the Chinese clothes are not suitable for riding horses. During the Warring States Period, the clothes of the various vassal states of the Huaxia tribe were generally the same. Today we generally refer to clothes as clothes. At that time, clothes meant upper garments and Shang meant lower garments. There are types of jackets, such as jacket, brown, coat, fur, robe and so on. Shang is a bottom garment, similar to a skirt, and is the same for both men and women. There is another type called Shenyi, which means the clothes and clothes are connected together, which is equivalent to the dress in later generations. ——As you can imagine, whether you are wearing a skirt and robe or a dress, it is really difficult to ride a horse, or even gallop on a horse, and perform various complex and difficult movements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, how did the nomads do it? It turns out that their clothes are different from those of the Chinese people. The main features of the Hufu of the nomadic people are a short jacket with narrow sleeves and crotch trousers. The former is convenient for archery and the latter is convenient for horseback riding. In addition, the shoes of the Chinese people are made of cloth, while the shoes of the Hu people are made of leather. Leather boots are naturally more suitable for outdoor sports than cloth shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When King Wuling of Zhao disregarded many objections, including from his own uncle, and vigorously promoted Hufu riding and archery, he was like a magical magician who in the blink of an eye transformed the remote and weak Zhao country. Rising powerfully at a speed that dazzled the princes. The first real cavalry in Chinese history was born. The flying cavalry caused a dimensionality-reducing blow to the cumbersome chariots - from a historical perspective, King Zhao Wuling&#39;s Hufu cavalry not only marked China&#39;s transition from the era of chariot warfare to the era of cavalry warfare, but also meant that Hufu&#39;s It has become the common clothing of Chinese people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on the cavalry, Zhao conquered the three Hus. &quot;King Lin Hu offered his horse&quot; and &quot;Xiang Zhao Gu took control of Hu and sent his troops.&quot; Zhao State&#39;s control of Sanhu means that it can continuously obtain war horses, further increasing the strength of the cavalry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is particularly important is that after conquering Sanhu, Zhao State annexed Zhongshan, which lay across the middle of Zhao State and blocked Zhao State from the north to the south. In order to destroy Zhongshan, King Wuling of Zhao used troops several times. Zhongshan was weak and Zhao Guo was strong, so Zhongshan had to constantly cede territory and seek peace. After each time of ceding territory and seeking peace, Zhao became stronger and Zhongshan became weaker. Entrusting one&#39;s own safety to bribing the enemy would only make the enemy more greedy. A few years later, the Zhao army captured the capital of Zhongshan. The last king of Zhongshan was exiled and Zhongshan died. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With Zhongshan destroyed, Zhao State has solved its inner problems, and there are no more obstacles in the north and south territories. Moreover, although Zhongshan is weaker than the Seven Kingdoms, it is also a country of thousands of chariots, and Zhao&#39;s national power has greatly increased due to this. &quot;Warring States Policy&quot; said: &quot;Zhongshan is five hundred miles away, and Zhao is good at it alone. After his success and fame, he has become a vassal, and no one in the world can harm him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After rapid expansion, Zhao&#39;s territory reached its peak: &quot; It reaches Yan and Dai in the north, and Yunzhong and Jiuyuan in the west.&quot; Every inch of territory captured from the enemy echoed with the crisp sound of horse hooves and the long cry of powerful bows. With the cavalry pouring into the enemy formation like a tide as the background, Zhao State ushered in its unprecedented glorious years...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Handan in early autumn, the wind was a bit cold. In the afternoon, people came and went in Congtai Square, and the tall statue of King Zhao Wuling cast a heavy shadow. Congtai was completed more than two thousand years ago. The Congtai at that time was far larger and more spectacular than the Qing Dynasty building I see now. The main function of Congtai was for King Zhao Wuling to review troops and enjoy singing and dancing. In the pre-Qin Dynasty, when buildings were generally low, tall towers stood on the vast plains, which were symbols of the king&#39;s authority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With millions of people looking up to him, King Zhao Wuling ascended the Congtai step by step. This aloof king becomes even more mysterious and majestic because he is far away from all living beings. When the rapidly expanding territory and invincible cavalry made Zhao the only country among the princes that had the strength to compete with Qin, King Wuling of Zhao, who was looking forward to his glory, looked at the people in the audience who would give him orders at any time. And when the soldiers are stained with blood, their ambition to conquer the world seems to be surging like a spring tide...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 02/23/QEreryEQMOEb9mCKtYQkcNHIeg5xtuTanyqIesQd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1428&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/02/23/QEreryEQMOEb9mCKtYQkcNHIeg5xtuTanyqIesQd. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;225445&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Handan Ancient Congtai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Sand Dunes&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 298 BC, in Xianyang, the capital of Qin, King Zhao of Qin, who had reigned for ten years, received an envoy from Zhao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The envoy’s temperament and speech surprised King Qin Zhao. After the messenger said goodbye, the more he thought about it, the more he felt something was wrong: this was definitely not an ordinary messenger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Qin Zhao sent people to investigate and found out that the envoy had returned to Zhao. However, some of the envoy&#39;s entourage had not yet had time to leave. After questioning the entourage, their answers surprised King Zhao of Qin and his ministers: the envoy &quot;whose appearance was very majestic and unworthy of a human minister&quot; turned out to be the father-in-law of the State of Zhao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called father-in-law is Zhao Yong, the former king of Zhao State - later given the posthumous title of Wu Ling and known as King Zhao Wuling in history. The year before, King Zhao Wuling passed the throne to his son Zhao He, calling himself the master father, equivalent to the supreme emperor in later generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did the father-in-law of Zhao go to Qin in disguise to see the King of Qin? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that before the annexation of Sanhu and the destruction of Zhongshan, between Zhao and Qin, only a small part of the southwest of Zhao State and the northeastern part of Qin State bordered.诸侯要攻打秦国，必须经由秦国东部的函谷关西进，而函谷关易守难攻，诸侯奔袭千里，却对一夫当关万夫莫开的秦国无能为力。随着赵国占领云中和九原，形势悄然巨变：云中和九原在秦国北部，这就意味着，赵军可以从北向南，由秦国北方南下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵武灵王就是这样设想的。为了侦察秦国国情，他冒险扮作赵国使者前往秦国——两千年后，另一位远隔万里的帝王也像赵武灵王一样乔装打扮，深入到邻近各国考察，此人就是俄国的彼得大帝。彼得大帝为了使落后的俄国强大起来，曾化装成水手，造访西欧各国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前往秦国前，赵武灵王在宫中会见群臣，宣布把王位传给不到十岁的小儿子赵何，由肥义任相国，他自称主父。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵武灵王内禅给儿子，其目的是想摆脱国内具体政务，把全部精力投入到伐秦战争中。当然，他这样做还有另一番考虑：赵武灵王的长子赵章，此时已成人，按礼制，应该立赵章而不是赵何。但是，由于赵武灵王曾经十分宠爱赵何的生母吴娃，而吴娃刚去世不久，对吴娃的追怀与对小儿子的怜爱交织在这位多情的君王心中。于是，他决定立赵何为王。赵何年龄太小，他希望用禅让的方式让他尽快进入角色，趁自己还健在，教会他如何治理天下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，废长立幼却引发了可怕的后果，也使赵国的崛起如同昙花一现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵章被废后，赵武灵王封他为安阳君，但赵章对父亲的安排耿耿于怀。并且，朝臣也分为两派，一部分同情赵章，一部分支持赵何。关键时刻，赵武灵王又犯下大错：他看到成年的长子以臣子的身份跪在幼子脚下时，对长子的处境产生了怜悯之情，竟打算把赵国一分为二，让两个儿子各自称王。这一想法，遭到了肥义等人坚决反对。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵武灵王的计划未及实施，双方的矛盾已经到了不可调和的地步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;悲剧，最终在一个叫沙丘的地方上演。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁在《史记》里三次写到沙丘。或者说，沙丘这个小地方，至少发生过三起重大历史事件：其一，商纣王建肉林酒池；其二，秦始皇最后一次出巡时病死；其三，赵武灵王父子相残。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广宗属河北邢台市下辖县，距邯郸市区约七十公里。广宗县城西北的大平台乡，公路附近，立着一对阙台，台后，树着两块碑，上面的字都是：沙丘平台遗址。碑后，栅栏封起一座土堆，那就是历代相传的沙丘宫遗址——从商朝直到秦朝，虽然天命流转，天子走马灯似地变幻，但这里一直建有行宫。如今，野岭荒郊，草长鸦飞，丝毫看不出宫殿的迹象。唯有一旁的小树林里，一群脏兮兮的山羊正埋头咬着铁丝一样的枯草，牧羊人坐在石头上，和山羊一样面无表情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵武灵王在两个儿子之间摇摆不定，对他和他的国家而言，都是一场空前的灾难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前295年，赵武灵王在沙丘宫举行朝会，赵章及其追随者发动兵变，肥义被害，赵何在将军高信保护下逃走，而早有准备的支持赵何的公子成——公子成系赵武灵王叔父，曾坚决反对胡服骑射——火速率军从邯郸赶来，包围了沙丘宫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵章眼见大势已去，便逃进宫中，希望得到父亲庇护。但是，公子成和李兑却将赵章杀死。此时，赵武灵王已失去了对政局的控制，公子成和李兑既不敢弑君，更不敢撤围。于是，便令宫内所有人员退出，独独不放赵武灵王出宫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;缺吃少喝，赵武灵王只得生食幼雀，终至“三月余而饿死沙丘宫”。这位雄才大略的英主，竟以这种窝囊的方式在空荡荡的行宫里悲愤死去。随同他的肉身一起腐朽的，是赵国称雄天下的霸图和它恍如流星划过的辉煌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，经由赵武灵王变法打下的坚实基础，还将在相当长时间里继续支撑赵国。自齐、楚被打残后，赵国就是秦国以外实力最强的诸侯。因此，赵武灵王的子孙，还可以凭借他改革的余荫，继续与秦国周旋：咸阳宫里，蔺相如完璧归赵；渑池会上，蔺相如折冲樽俎；阏与城外，赵奢大破秦军——这一切，仰仗的都是赵武灵王胡服骑射以来积累的实力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;只不过，这实力，随着后代子孙的不肖，随着国运的此消彼长，必将日益式微，直到丛台五百里外，一场大战爆发……&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;长平&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;去高平前，我看过一段视频：一道二十多米长、大半米高的断崖上，泥土之间，如同镶嵌着石头那样，镶嵌着密密麻麻的人骨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种令人惊悚的景象，对高平人来说，一点也不陌生。多年来，一场大雨或是一次基建，都可能惊现大量白花花的人骨。没有人知道他们是谁的儿子，谁的父亲，谁的丈夫。人们只知道，自古以来，作为兵家必争之地，高平的黄土下掩埋了难以计数的尸骨。其中，仅仅是秦赵之间的那场大决战，双方死亡人数就可能在六十万以上——如今，整个高平市的常住人口，也不过四十五万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高平，古称长平。战国时，属韩国。七国中，韩国最弱，又与秦国毗邻，被吊打的可悲命运几乎是注定的。高平所属的上党，即今山西长治一带，位于太行山西南，太岳山之东，王屋山之北，“其所最高，故曰上党也”。这里地势高耸，对周围有居高临下之势。穿越崇山峻岭的太行八陉，有四条在上党。通过它，东进华北平原，西入临汾盆地，南指洛阳，北望太原，自古就是兵家必争要地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前262年，秦军攻占野王（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;今河南沁阳&lt;/span>;），上党与韩国主体分割，成了一块孤零零的飞地。为此，韩国不得不答应把上党割让给秦国，以换取和平。然而，上党人民不愿被以残暴著称的虎狼之秦统治，上党郡守冯亭派使者到赵国，请求把上党所属十七座城池献给赵国，赵国派兵保卫上党。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从天而降的十七座城池，到底要不要接受，赵国君臣有过一番争论。最终，赵何之子赵孝成王赵丹实在拒绝不了如此大的诱惑，在平原君赵胜鼓动下，他接纳了上党，并派重兵布防。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;眼看上党已成囊中之物，没想到半路杀出个赵国，秦国自然不会善罢甘休。并且，秦相范雎认为，此前，秦国攻占了楚国大片土地，又曾兵逼大梁、新郑，打得魏、韩没有还手之力，却仍然没能称王天下，主要原因就是赵国未屈服。所以，必须占领上党，再攻打赵国首都邯郸以西地区，威胁赵国腹心地带，以逼赵国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是，中国历史上最著名的战役之一——长平之战爆发了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高平市区，丹河流过。溯丹河而上，在高平市以北，有一座名为长平的小村庄。长平村，即古长平城。丹河两岸，谷地平坦，更远处，东西山峰逶迤。就在这片谷地及附近，还有许多地名让人联想起那场惨烈的决定国运的大战：围城、箭头、白起台、骷髅山、廉颇屯、将军岭……在这样的地方寻幽访古，你能感觉到，历史并不只是书写在纸页上，还烙印在山川间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦、赵两国大军，各沿长平城左右五十里的山地构筑营垒。秦军由王龁率领，赵军由廉颇率领。廉颇认为，秦军士气旺，意在速战。赵军弱小，处于劣势，最好筑垒固守。从前260年七月起，双方在几次小型交锋后，廉颇便令赵军凭借有利地形固守不出。秦军求战不得，渐渐失去锐气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两军对峙长达两年有余，秦国开始实施反间计——反间计是秦国惯用伎俩，且每每收到奇效——秦国间谍潜入赵国，大肆散布流言，声称秦军真正害怕的是赵括，而非廉颇。赵孝成王本就对廉颇采取守势有所不满，怀疑他怯战，及至听到流言，信以为真——他如同秦人希望的那样，把身经百战的廉颇撤下来，换上了纸上谈兵的赵括。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;得知赵国易将，秦昭王大喜，立即派有战神之称的白起秘密前往长平，取代王龁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;悲剧，已然不可阻挡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵括上任后，一改廉颇法度，由守势变攻势。白起佯败退走，却从背后偷袭赵军补给线，并将赵军截为互不相连的两部分——一部分是赵括亲率的主力，一部分是守卫营垒的留守。赵括返回营垒的归路被切断，陷入秦军包围圈，只好就地坚守。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了吃掉赵军，秦昭王下令全国总动员——所有十五岁以上男丁，全部征集入伍。可以说，为了长平之战，秦国几乎倾整个国家的力量孤注一掷。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵括被围，得不到补给，绝粮一个半月后，军中甚至发生了士兵自相残杀、以尸体为食的惨剧。赵括几次组织精锐突围，均被秦军击退。最后一次突围时，赵括亲自上阵，却被一阵乱箭射死。主帅阵亡，军中断粮已久，赵军兵无斗志，只得向秦军投降。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;投降的赵军，人数多达四十万。白起认为，这些赵军将士，秦国既没法把他们改编为秦军，又不可能将他们释放。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;惨绝人寰的大屠杀就这样发生了。四十多万赵军将士，除二十多名年幼者被放还外，其余全部被杀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四十万这一数字实在过于庞大，以至后人怀疑《史记》是否有所夸大。然而，高平地区不断发现的累累白骨，却证明了大屠杀曾真实发生。只是，到底有多少人死于非命，则是一个永远的谜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长平之战纪念馆里，有一座用玻璃保护起来的尸骨坑。透过玻璃，层层叠叠的尸骨发出白生生的幽光。那天，纪念馆里除我之外再无他人，凝视着这些两千多年前非正常死亡者的遗骸，我仿佛听到了兵器击中肉体的闷响，以及此起彼伏的绝望的惨叫……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/02/23/EXiG7MlCUKRdWHYtFlxAnpwVCdVbfxsm64C088yE.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;令人意外的是，庙里还有一间小屋，门前挂着一块红底白字的牌：烧豆腐坊。烧豆腐是高平的一种特色美食，又名白起肉。 ——因痛恨白起坑杀数十万赵国将士，高平人发明了这种食物：把豆腐当肉，再用豆腐渣和蒜泥、生姜调成汁，当白起的脑浆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长平之战遗址纪念馆外，也有一尊塑像，塑的还是赵括。塑像下方，有八个字：空谈误国，实干兴邦。历史以哭喊、血泪和累累白骨在无声地警示后人。至于后人是否真的会记取教训，历史从来都无能为力。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;王嘉男是典型的“天才少年”，很小的时候便被发现其在田径运动上有天分。他1996年8月出生于辽宁沈阳，2005年参加沈河区运动会，100米短跑虽然成绩一般，但被沈阳市体育运动学校教练杨克强一眼相中。杨教练当时在操场上看到了正在走路的王嘉男，发现他虽然不算很高，但是腿长，走路“一颠一颠”的，“有运动员那个劲儿，感觉是个好苗子。”那时候王嘉男还在读小学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来的他没有辜负启蒙教练的眼光，杨克强评价他“平时训练很刻苦，非常聪明，领悟能力强，很多技术动作几次就调整过来了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;起初，王嘉男并不是跳远运动员，而是十项全能运动员，最擅长的项目是撑竿跳高。 14岁，王嘉男进入徐州田径队；16岁，被江苏省体工队选中，代表江苏省参加全国室内男子十项全能比赛，获得7063分。这是2012年世界青年运动员中第二好的成绩：跳远7.80米，100米跑了10秒88，撑杆跳突破5米，跳高跳了1.94米——这在当时堪称“十项全能天才”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王嘉男第一次跳过8米，也是在16岁，以8.04米的成绩获得全国跳远冠军，要知道，这是一个训练多年的老将才可能达到的成绩。中国男子跳远从20世纪80年代初打破8米大关开始，一直在寻求突破，但大多运动员并未在国际舞台上崭露头角，最好的成绩都是在国内或者亚洲范围内的比赛中取得，直到李金哲等选手开始在国际舞台上出现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也让王嘉男在2013年初开始专注跳远，并入选国家队。 “改练跳远，就是对田径的热爱吧。我是从十项全能出身的运动员，对所有田径项目都保持着热爱，总有一种自信：感觉自己不管练什么，都不是问题，我不是一般人啊，我能行。”他说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为“天才跳远少年”的王嘉男，一路走来确实比较顺利。有人称他“运气好”，他也并不避讳这一点。他觉得，“从2015年主场拿铜牌，2016年里约奥运会创造历史最好名次，实力是基础，但我的运气更好一些。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年7月，在印度浦那举行的亚锦赛上，在中国跳远“一哥”李金哲缺席的情况下，17岁的王嘉男以7米95的成绩获得跳远冠军，连世青赛都没参加过的他就这样得到了参加莫斯科世锦赛的资格。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年7月24日，未满18岁的王嘉男在美国尤金一鸣惊人，以8米08的成绩夺得世界青年田径锦标赛男子跳远冠军。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年北京田径世锦赛，鸟巢比赛现场，中国男子跳远队三名选手李金哲、高兴龙、王嘉男同时出现在决赛上，当时有人惊呼，“中国跳远最好的时代已经来了。”19岁的王嘉男拿到了跳远铜牌，成为了中国也是亚洲首位登上世锦赛男子跳远领奖台的运动员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这也给王嘉男带来了压力。 “说实话拿到那枚奖牌之后，对我的信心其实没有特别大的提升，反而是给我的压力更大。这枚奖牌是亚洲人32年来唯一一枚奖牌，被我拿到了，而且是8米18的成绩，不高不低的成绩，当时我自己觉得这个成绩有没有说服力？这导致我2016年紧接着一整年成绩都不是特别好，感觉整个人被铜牌给压住了。”在接受央视采访时，他坦言背上了包袱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年全国田径冠军赛暨亚运会选拔赛，王嘉男跳出8.47米的成绩，不仅追平了李金哲保持的男子跳远全国纪录，也是王嘉男的个人最好成绩。在2018年雅加达亚运会田径男子跳远决赛中，王嘉男以8米24的破亚运会纪录的成绩摘得金牌。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;失利蛰伏，重登顶峰&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;一路顺利走来的背后，有伤病困扰，也有即将到来的意外。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年里约奥运会和2017年全运会之后，王嘉男的左右膝经历了两次膝关节手术。当知道自己半月板撕裂之后，他甚至“有点不想练了，想退役”，吃消炎药吃了一个多月才开始逐渐好转。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来对他职业生涯的一次重大打击，便是征战东京奥运会失利。当时王嘉男被寄予厚望，是国家田径队跳跃部唯一一个有奖牌任务的运动员。他虽然拿到了去往东京奥运会的名额，但因和教练磨合的问题以及极大的压力，发挥不佳，只跳出了7米81的成绩，无缘决赛。 “对我来讲打击也很大，我觉得所有的问题都出现在我自身问题上。”他把责任都揽在自己身上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次打击并没有将他击垮，他总结经验，重燃信心准备再战，“再差还能差到哪儿去？”他回忆起那段时光。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接下来便是他在尤金世锦赛的“惊人一跳”，让更多人记住这张中国面孔。出征尤金世锦赛前，王嘉男在社交媒体分享了手机App上的一张日历表：“来到国家队已经3078天， 2016年奥运会跳远决赛已过2058天，第一次半月板手术已过1928天，第二次半月板手术已过1565天……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次，王嘉男没有延续过去的风格，直到最后一跳之前，他8米03的成绩还仅排在第五位。显示成绩的大屏幕上，第三名的成绩是8米15，“不是特别高，我觉得我应该可以去冲一下，就是仰着头跳也能拼个奖牌。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年7月17日，最后一跳，在空中完美滑行，落地，他回头看了一眼沙坑，心里有了底。看到赛场大屏幕打出8米36的成绩时，王嘉男蹲在了地上，掩面而泣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/VBqSOdlm1LeWgX4cPeNrTmafyIaYCCjMlzec8A6L.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/VBqSOdlm1LeWgX4cPeNrTmafyIaYCCjMlzec8A6L.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;最终，25岁的王嘉男在俄勒冈世界田径锦标赛男子跳远决赛中，凭借最后的“惊天一跃”打破亚洲纪录夺得冠军，成为第一位在田径世锦赛上赢得田赛项目冠军的中国男子运动员，同时也是继刘翔、王浩、陈定之后第四位在田径世锦赛上赢得金牌的中国男选手。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一战成名的王嘉男，在此后要面对的是，如何超越自己、打破世界纪录，但这并非易事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;世界名将、美国田径运动员刘易斯曾在社交平台转发一篇文章，名为《为什么跳远世界纪录如此难被打破》，文中提到：1968年比蒙创造8米90的跳远世界纪录，如果鲍威尔没有在1991年以8米95的成绩打破了世界纪录，那1968年比蒙的8米90的成绩依然无人可以接近。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;过去的84年，跳远的世界纪录仅仅被3人拥有过，杰西·欧文斯保持了25年，鲍勃·比蒙保持了23年，迈克·鲍威尔保持了31年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不久前的布达佩斯世锦赛，王嘉男名列第五，而在杭州亚运会，他终于成功卫冕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赛后，他提到“8.22米这个成绩可能比我的赛事目标还是差了一点，本来我想打破自己保持的赛会纪录，但是还差了2厘米。接下来我还要在比赛中找问题，布达佩斯世锦赛成绩不是很理想，也是让我吸取教训。我希望把布达佩斯世锦赛和亚运会这两场的经验应用到巴黎奥运会上，让自己发挥出一个相对不错的成绩。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“艰难困苦，玉汝于成。”他曾说，自己始终相信这句话，从东京奥运失利，到创造亚洲纪录的一跃，再到杭州亚运会成功卫冕，一路走来，王嘉男自身便是对这句话最好的印证。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[不受理“知假买假”，可能会有怎样的结果？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258016]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;近日，四川有一地的市场监督管理局发布告诫书，严禁以知假买假等牟利性消费进行投诉举报。公告称，一旦判定为恶意投诉，市监局将不予受理，同时，对利用投诉举报进行敲诈勒索、威胁恐吓等行为，将移送警方追究恶意投诉举报人违法犯罪责任。这份“告诫书”不出意外地引起了极大争议。该局随后从其社媒账号上删除了这份文件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的公告不是第一次出现了。近年来，全国有不少地方发布过类似的公告。市监部门表示其目的是“营造放心舒心消费和良好营商环境”“同等保护消费者和经营主体的合法权益”。但是，对假冒伪劣等违法商品进行监管是市监部门的法定职责，将“知假买假”认定为恶意投诉拒绝受理，有怠于履行职责、行政不作为的嫌疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“牟利性打假”也就是俗称的“职业打假”，其法律依据主要是消费者权益保护法、食品安全法、药品管理法的相关规定。消保法规定，经营者提供商品或者服务有欺诈行为的，除了赔偿消费者受到的损失外，还应增加赔偿商品价款或服务费用3倍的金额，不足500元的赔500元，也就是“假一赔三”。食品安全法、药品管理法则规定，如果生产不符合食品安全标准的食品、假药、劣药，或者经营明知是不符合食品安全标准的食品、明知是假药劣药仍然销售使用，则“假一赔十”，最低为1000元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;依托这些法律规定，诞生了一批“职业打假人”，他们在市场上寻找不合格的商品、食品和药品，购买之后投诉或起诉，以获得三倍或十倍的额外赔偿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打击假冒伪劣商品，维护食品药品安全，是市场监管部门的法定职责。但市场是非常庞大的，只靠市场监管部门的力量，难以发现所有的违法行为。法律规定惩罚性赔偿的目的，除了保护消费者利益之外，更重要的是希望通过惩罚性赔偿，让造假售假的不法分子付出更大的代价，以遏制造假售假行为。有了惩罚性赔偿的激励，职业打假人也有更大的动机去发现假冒伪劣商品并向监管部门举报。在这个意义上，职业打假人实际上是监管部门的帮手。通过他们提供的线索去发现违法行为，比监管部门自己去大海捞针，效率要高得多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，确实有一部分人以打假为名行敲诈勒索之实。比如有的先栽赃再“打假”，把外带的过期食品放到超市，栽赃商家售卖过期食品。有的把超市快过期的食品故意藏起来，超市没能发现没有及时收回，等过期了再去买出来，以售卖过期食品为由索赔。有的甚至没有发现问题商品，也以举报威胁商家交“顾问费”。这些行为已经不是打假，而是“黑打”，是违法犯罪。对这些“黑打”进行打击，是必要的。但对于大多数正当行使法律赋予的权利、按照法律规定要求赔偿的职业打假人，监管部门仅仅以他们的打假行为是“牟利”而拒绝接受他们的举报投诉，没有法律依据，涉嫌怠于履行法定职责，可能助长造假售假之风。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;监管部门认定“恶意投诉”的标准中，包括获得惩罚性赔偿后再次购买同样的商品再投诉的。但如果不合格商品第一次被发现后就被彻底清理出市场，职业打假人又怎么能再次买到同样的不合格商品呢？如果售卖不合格商品第一次被处罚后继续卖，监管部门却不再受理后续的投诉，是不是售假的商家就可以肆无忌惮继续卖假货了呢？这样的规定，到底是保护了消费者还是保护了造假售假者？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，至少在食品药品领域，司法系统对于“知假买假”是支持的。最高法2013年发布的司法解释《关于审理食品药品纠纷案件适用法律若干问题的规定》明确，对于食品、药品质量纠纷，存在质量问题的食品、药品的生产者、销售者以消费者知假买假为理由抗辩的，法院不予支持。也就是支持消费者“知假买假”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而作为政府部门的市场监管局却禁止“知假买假”，认定其为“恶意”，与司法机关的规定相左，一旦被打假人以行政不作为告上法庭，恐怕难免会输。据《法治日报》报道，一名职业打假人曾举报贵州、云南等省份多家单位销售假药，市场监管部门查实后，却以他不是以消费为目的购买、牟取不正当利益等为由，拒绝对他奖励，他提起诉讼，法院判决市监部门败诉，应对他进行奖励。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不法商人卖假，损害的不仅仅是消费者的利益，也会损害合法商家的利益。要“优化营商环境”“保护经营主体的利益”，要打击的应该是敲诈勒索企业的行为，保护的是合法经营主体的利益。如果一刀切禁止“知假买假”，只会纵容“知假卖假”，客观上保护的恐怕更多是那些不法商人的利益。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;说起石家庄，大众或许感觉陌生，但说起石家庄的一些摇滚乐队，乐迷们却如数家珍。万能青年旅店、黎明的领袖等许多摇滚乐队都与石家庄有一定的渊源。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;中国摇滚曾多辉煌&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;回看历史，中国的摇滚乐已经有几十年&lt;/span>;的发展，摇滚乐也有着丰沃的土壤。早在80年代，随着改革开放和社会的变迁，本土摇滚乐便偷偷萌芽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1986年5月，北京工人体育馆，24岁的崔健用高亢并带着怒吼的声音唱出一首《一无所有》。当歌词激昂而出时&lt;span>;，全场上万名观众大声地唱和呐喊，中国摇滚开始了一段史无前例的进程。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;随后，一批优秀的乐队和乐手纷纷涌现。发轫于北京、西安的黑豹乐队、唐朝乐队、毒刺乐队等横空出世，相继推出了《黑豹》《梦回唐朝》《中国火I》等专辑，以迅雷不及掩耳之势掀起了中国摇滚的浪潮。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在那个物质尚且匮乏的年代，摇滚乐队的专辑却疯狂大卖。黑豹乐队的同名专辑《黑豹》卖了150万张，唐朝乐队的《梦回唐朝》卖了200万张，成为&lt;/span>;至今都难以企及的爆款。年轻人们留着大波浪、穿着喇叭裤，拿着录音机反复播放这些专辑，以听着这些摇滚乐为时尚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1994，则被称为彼时中国摇滚的巅峰之年。窦唯、何勇、张楚、唐朝乐队等集齐香港，在代表了流行音乐风向标的红磡体育馆，演出了一场与港乐无关的“中国摇滚新势力”演唱会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;台上，随着《高级动物》《钟鼓楼》《飞&lt;span>;翔鸟》等曲目的响起，台下，来自香港和世界各地的观众在三个多小时里又蹦又跳地将喉咙嘶吼到沙哑。演唱会之后，香港各大媒体都用头条纷纷报道，以“摇滚灵魂，震爆香江”记录了这一经典时刻。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/d5332f9dd68b222b6707f7425e603845.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;如今，离90年代已经过去了数十载春秋，中国摇滚乐的发展发生了巨大的变化，摇滚乐的阵地也在更迭变迁。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;作为曾经最主要的摇滚阵地的北京、西安，呈现出新老更替的现状。崔健、许巍&lt;/span>;、郑钧等摇滚前辈更多地成为了划时代的记忆在人们脑海中流淌，新晋的痛仰乐队、黑撒乐队、玄乐队、岛屿心情等则成为当前演出的主流。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;腾空跃起的石家庄和河南新乡，就更代表了摇滚DNA的延伸。在石家庄，万能青年旅店、相对论乐队、小城之春、橡皮泥乐队等本土乐队相继崛起。尤其是融合了摇滚、朋克、民谣等元素的万能青年旅店的诞生，像一把利刃横空出世，。 《杀死那个石家庄人&lt;span>;》《秦皇岛》等歌曲都堪称许多乐迷的接头暗号。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在河南新乡，延续着曾经吸引了唐朝、轮回、零点、超载等前来演出的摇滚基因，不大的地域也诞生了如小南瓜乐队、疯医乐队、独眼巨人乐队等诸多代表着年轻世代摇滚力量的乐队。在当地，甚至某间奶茶店的店主、面店的老板，也能随时放下厨具玩一把乐器。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;除此之外，山东的Rock味道在各种音乐节弥漫。济南耳立音乐节、日照海洋音乐节、青岛凤凰音乐节、潍坊国潮音乐节、东营草莓音乐节、滨州迷笛音乐节等诸多的音乐节，同样将摇滚元素的发布变成了文化生活的日常。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;而在千里之外的天府之国成都，又是另一个关于摇滚的重要叙事场。不管是唐蕾的小酒馆乐队，还是声音玩具、海龟先生、阿修罗等乐队的发起人，都与蜀地有着不解的渊源，成都摇滚也从玉林路的live House出发不断地走向全国。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;中国摇滚发展的可能&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;可以发现，如今的中国摇滚，不再局限于某地，而是在更多地区、城市的年轻人中得到普及。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;一方面，有影响力、传唱度高的歌曲，迅速俘获了年轻人的心，让不同城市的年轻人能通过音乐交头接耳、产生共鸣。另一方面，随着2019年开始的音综如《乐队的夏天》等的热播和各种音乐节的举办，年轻人们通过观摩比赛和亲临现场等方式，更多地感受到了摇滚和音乐的魅力，也孵化了更多的乐迷。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;音乐节方面，虽然国外有老&lt;/span>;牌的如伍德斯托克音乐节、格拉斯顿伯里音乐节等极具影响力的音乐节，但随着石家庄、新乡等地对摇滚之城的打造，以及各种音乐节城市化、规模化的推广，中国的音乐节正在陆续崛起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;草莓音乐节、迷笛音乐节、简单生活音乐节等，业已逐渐成为广为人知的音乐节品牌，在国内具备了较强的号召力和影响力，在各地举办都能吸引许多乐迷前往观看。以后，走出国门与国外的一些音乐节合作，或去亚洲或欧美其他城市举办，也未尝没有可能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;并且，随着摇滚和流行音乐的专业化程度的提高，现代流行音乐包括摇滚在内的专业学习和培训也已成型。北京&lt;span>;的迷笛音乐学校现就开设了多种专业，通过教授涵盖流行、朋克、摇滚等在内的现代音乐课程，让喜欢摇滚乐的学子们可以进行系统的学习，学校也产出了如新裤子乐队贝斯手赵梦、逃跑计划主唱毛川等摇滚音乐人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;事实上，作为一种音乐和艺术&lt;/span>;表达形式，摇滚乐在不同的社会时期都记录着现实和当代年轻人的迷惘、思考和情感。在新的Z世代的音乐氛围中，必然不能少了摇滚的存在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;未来的中国摇滚乐，不同地域的文化和创作人的碰撞、融合，将为音乐带来更多可能，也会在明日之队中诞生新的&lt;span>;亮眼新星。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[花西子眉笔引发的行业审视：直播电商，成也主播，毁也主播？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258032]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023亚洲宠物展上，一名主播在展台上直播带货。图文无关。界面新闻视觉中国图&quot;

&lt;p>;将产品送上热门直播间，是小品牌打响知名度的优选方法。中国计量科学研究院等单位发布的直播电商行业蓝皮书数据显示，2023年上半年，重点监测电商平台直播销售额达1.27万亿元，直播场次超1.1亿场，直播商品数超7000万个，活跃主播数超270万人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按照主播选品流程，他们会跟对方的商务人员沟通，等待反馈。如无反馈，就是默认不合适。像大浪淘沙一般，“这个环节可能只有不到10%的主播或商务会回复我们”。 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;起初褚施会感到迷茫，不知是卡在何处。后来图景逐渐清晰，“其实根本就不是产品的问题，而是价格或者是佣金方面不满意”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她发现，主播们会相对集中地去推各个品类的同一款产品，新品冒头尤为艰难。被主播大力推介的产品，实则是品牌方给出了高额佣金的那款，“像我们知道的几个品，给的佣金有60到70个点，在那个类目里面已经卖到top了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;70%佣金意味着，如果一个产品卖100元，要给到主播70元。而剩余的费用，要涵盖产品开发、原料、包材等成本，也要包括仓储物流、场地及人力成本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们觉得这个业态是非常之不健康。”褚施认为，高佣金倒逼成本降低，“这么多的利润全部都给到主播，他们收取了这么高的佣金，但是并没有创造相应的社会价值，没有提供更多的就业岗位，压缩了上游品牌方和供应链端的利润，品牌方就只能不断地压缩成本，产品就会越做越差，员工的待遇也会越来越差”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四五年前，她曾为当时的美妆品牌对接主播，佣金在20%到30%之间，但直播生态逐渐演变，“从前年到去年，佣金就不断地往上攀升。我觉得也不是主播叫价叫起来的，还是因为行业太卷了，美妆也好，直播也好，都太卷了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美妆是公认的最卷赛道之一。美妆MCN机构五月美妆联合创始人南山对此亦有同感，在平台上美妆流量虽多，进场人数亦多，“我觉得从2019、2020年就开始卷，每年都在比以前更卷，卷得没停下来过”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卷价格、卷机制、卷内容、卷资本……同样品质的东西，价格在竞争中不断走低，但给主播的佣金却在逐步提高，“我觉得这个卷是各个方面的，产品同质化也非常严重，每一个价格带都站满了竞争对手”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杭州希疆新零售研究院院长、原阿里研究院副院长游五洋告诉南方周末记者，以眉笔为例，从原材料加工费的角度来讲，算上出厂成本加税收，可能不到10元。化妆品最大的成本就是销售费用，此前，这一部分包括营销及渠道费用，即广告、明星代言、渠道扣点费用，线下批发商、代理商的利润。而现在，如果通过直播电商的方式销售，就属于直接零售，最主要就是流量费用、广告费用、主播的带货佣金及坑位费，“这些费用占比是很高的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;游五洋指出，目前直播销售体系最大的问题是呈低价化趋势，“直播电商出现之后，把中国的零售市场可以说搅得天翻地覆。大家都在拼低价，企业没利润，就没有钱去做产品研发创新，可能出现劣币驱逐良币的情况”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;只关心三点：价格、佣金、坑位费&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;价格和赠品是能否吸引消费者在直播间下单时的重点，在这一点上，超头主播的确有着更高的话语权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;曾将产品送上李佳琦直播间的某国货品牌负责人乔磊（化名）告诉南方周末记者，一两年前李佳琦的坑位费“也不贵”，“大概就是8万多块钱”，佣金是百分之三四十，和别的主播差不多是持平状态。但李佳琦价格压得很低，甚至是商家自己“从来没有卖过的价格”，“他不管你原来卖多少钱，他只会告诉你&#39;我想卖多少钱&#39;”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他会要求&#39;我是最低的&#39;，但他不会明着面跟你说，他只会告诉你一个价格，看你到底能不能给。”乔磊说，双方还需签订保价协议，确保包括品牌自家直播间在内，不会出现更低的价格。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一条件近乎苛刻，但还是有大量商家乐于接受。即便是在此刻，亦有渴望登上超头直播间的小品牌在苦苦等待。莉莉安（化名）在一家做功效性护肤品的创业公司任品牌与电商负责人，对她来说，上李佳琦直播间这条路仍未打通，“我跟了他们已经有半年了，还在资料审核的阶段”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;如李佳琦（左一）这样的超头主播，无疑会对小品牌销售起到关键作用。视觉中国图&quot;

data-key=&quot;252934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;如李佳琦（左一）这样的超头主播，无疑会对小品牌销售起到关键作用。视觉中国图&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比而言，褚施接触过的主播“真正专业的很少”，品牌提供产品卖点，主播照本宣科，“他们不太会问我们关于产品上的专业问题，因为现在的主播可以拥有的选择实在太多太多了，大大小小的商家都在等他们递品，他们不会去了解产品的原料、成分和功效。他们最关心的就是三个点，价格多少，佣金多少，有没有坑位费。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;已做了五年直播的主播林茉（化名）告诉南方周末记者，她会在直播前了解一下商品信息，提前一小时到直播间，跟运营沟通整体情况，直播时，主要告诉消费者三项信息：这个产品的价格有多优惠，这个东西有多好用，什么时候和场景会需要它。如果消费者有所动心但仍在纠结，就会强调附带的赠品与不断减少的库存，“再去逼一下单”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据褚施观察，这是因为直播间每个产品的讲解时间都非常有限，几分钟时间内，将优惠力度体现出来，以期打动用户，让其产生购买行为，“用&#39;量&#39;去体现产品的价值感，这个对他们来说是最快的方式”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林茉当过很长时间的品牌外聘主播，同三四十个品牌合作过，按小时计费，“卖多卖少全看我自己的职业道德素养，身上KPI销量的压力不是很大”。最近她跳出来单干，收取卖货佣金，卖得多便赚得多，紧迫感便多了几分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，平台会实时分析直播数据，显示当日的产品投放费用、销售量及销售总额，还会进行纵向对比。愈发直观的数据亦考验着主播的能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;品牌与主播的博弈机制&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;想要打造超头主播并不容易，南山所在的五月美妆曾有过一次冲击超头失败的经历。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这家MCN机构已孵化美妆达人六十多名。南山回忆，公司原本是“想往头部方面走的”。在2021年底，他们尝试扶持一名已有一千多万粉丝的美妆博主，该博主高峰时期一场能带货五六百万元。但他们很快发现头部主播“没那么好做”，很难拿到“特别好的机制”，直播频次提不上来，佣金率也比较低，很有可能“白忙活不赚钱”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卡住超头之路的关键之一是机制，即品牌商家给到主播的产品售价、赠品配置、佣金分成或其他激励资源。不同主播拿到的机制差异是显而易见的。南山以自家主播与行业头部主播做对比，同样一款洗发水，在两个直播间都卖119元两瓶，共1000毫升。在头部主播处，下单者能拿到额外赠送的四五百毫升洗发水，而自家可能只能拿到一两百毫升。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;超出品牌预期的销售额、将产品带成爆款、有良好的日常视频和直播数据，以及优秀的商务谈判能力，都能帮助主播拿到更好的机制，“如果拿不到好的机制，是很难让用户持续为她买单的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但南山也观察到，与前两年相比，品牌在机制上的“牺牲”越来越少。 “在2021年时，品牌更愿意给主播牺牲一些机制，比方说他在自己的旗舰店卖119元，可能会给到我们直播间99元。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;游五洋指出，品牌方与主播方本质上是博弈关系。品牌此前低价让利，是希望凭借主播带货，将粉丝吸引到自家官网账号，直接关注品牌本身。主播则需要直播间产品保持低价，维护好原有粉丝，抬高身价。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;产品在直播间的标价、主播方能拿到的佣金比例、消费者的赠品等，都是博弈重点。在2023年8月，南山他们以18万元的价格谈下一名百万粉丝主播的合作，包含两三条短视频、两条直播预热及一场专场直播，带货五项产品。品牌方的主要诉求是降低佣金、减少赠品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;双方手里拿着机制表，经历两三轮开会探讨，最终选择各退一步。平均佣金从31%左右降到28%，产品从两瓶600毫升119元及150毫升赠品，变成了两瓶128元加300毫升赠品，相当于“128元一下子到手三瓶”。两方对结果都算满意，算下来，两三场直播后，品牌初期投入“就会回来”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南山提到，部分品牌与主播也产生了新的合作关系，即在产品面世之前，品牌就会让主播参与到产品开发中，品牌方会和主播沟通：“我这个产品你觉得定多少钱合适”“哪些地方还不合适，我要改一改”，双方会拉长合作线。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“因为主播有个特点，他们比较了解消费者，会使整个产业链更好地贴近消费者。”中国社科院财经战略院研究室主任李勇坚指出，品牌与主播之间的深度合作是相对有益的，能够提高供应链的效率，有利于国产品牌快速形成。但需要警惕的是，有的主播可能会利用消费者的信任，进一步压榨消费者，“（要记得）你是代表消费者的利益，帮消费者去找到物美价廉的商品”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直播依旧是这家MCN机构2023年发力的方向。南山的依据是，消费者的心智已经形成，有日常在直播间买东西的习惯，同时，直播消费行为变得更加理性，除了价格外，也会考虑产品的适用度，“这时候我们通过直播这种形式去&#39;种草&#39;用户，让他进而下单”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年5月，杭州一个美妆电商在直播。图文无关。视觉中国图&quot;

&lt;p>;效果是显而易见的，李佳琦一场直播，为他们的店铺带来了十几万的访客，“原来的日销是五六万块钱，可能他帮我们直播带货之后，日销到了八九万，影响力在扩大”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但李勇坚指出，“依赖大厨”是直播电商生态最大的毛病。对于一个新生品牌，讲好品牌故事、做好产品、形成品牌力是最基本的，依赖头部主播去做品牌难度很大，“有个别的（成功）案例，但是这个案例能不能持续，如果没有品牌力、产品力的话，我觉得值得怀疑”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在他看来，现在直播电商的“天花板”已经出现。他称，电商的基本逻辑是舒展供应链，缩短营销链，“现在突然之间多了一个主播，砍走25%，砍走30%，这个商业逻辑本身就有问题的”。利益分配机制不健全、价格体系混乱、主播之间发展不均衡均是直播生态乱象，由此引发了新的问题，数据流量造假、虚假下单刷单。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对乔磊来说，直播领域的发展已趋于成熟。不论粉丝量是多是少，受众年龄是大是小，所处领域是热是冷，都有相应的竞争者，“其实现在每一个卡位上都有占位的，任何一个垂类赛道基本上都已被覆盖”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乔磊发现，往日里，每个平台、每位主播都有各自的受众，彼此影响不大，但到了“618”“双十一”这样的大促时期，几个平台的消费者重合率会明显变高，所有带货主播便会被拉至同一竞技场，竞争力的强弱格外明显。 “一到大型促销节点，其实尾部主播的生存空间是很小的，还是以头部主播为主。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样，竞争力不强的小品牌也会选择在大促时“躺平”自保，退出激烈战场。莉莉安称，大促期间流量费用都会变高，自家不具备抢流量分市场的能力，会主动避开战火，“一般（大促节）其实我们都不焦虑的，我们就直接摆烂”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;浙江工商大学经济学院教授、浙江省消费促进工作专家委员会委员赵浩兴告诉南方周末记者，目前直播领域生态是不健全的，“一方面拼命压低供应链上游的价格，另一方面又抬高销售价格，取得巨额利润。红利全都聚集在网红头上去了，生态圈的利润分配严重不合理，以后肯定是要打破这种现象”。他建议市场监管部门加强监管力度，希望供应链更加成熟完善，上下游利润分配合理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他称，目前直播行业已到了转型期，多种类型的垂直产业链直播、工厂直播、专家直播都在发挥更大作用，出现“小而美、小而专精”的特性，这也是“未来2.0版直播”的发展方向。 &lt;/p>;
