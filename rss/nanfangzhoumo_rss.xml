Later, I came to Beijing and lived in Dongcheng all year round. In my spare time, I would stroll in the alleys. I often saw Mr. Pujie&#39;s inscriptions and I admired them very much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu Yi is of the same generation as Pu, and his younger brother is named Pu Jie. There is no doubt about this. However, when I re-read &quot;The First Half of My Life&quot; written by Pu Yi, I saw a few passages that made me have a small question. The first paragraph is in the section &quot;Studying at Yuqing Palace&quot; in Chapter 2 &quot;My Childhood&quot;. Puyi mentioned some scenes of his studying at that time:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three people have received this honor, namely Puyi Jie, Yu Chong (son of Pu Lun, who has been reading Chinese with me), and Pu Jia (son of my seventh uncle Zaitao, who has been reading English with me since I was fourteen). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other two paragraphs are in Chapter 10. At this time, Puyi had returned to Beijing after ten years of transformation in the Northeast:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I heard Brother Brother&#39;s guqin and saw the words he wrote for me. His calligraphy attainments have indeed reached a new level. I also admired Brother Wu Wu’s new paintings of flowers and birds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My fifth sister, sixth brother Jian and I walked westward slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you hear these affectionate titles: eldest brother, fifth brother, and sixth brother; when you see their names: Pulun, Pujia, Puyi, Puyi, and Pujian, you know their relationship with Puyi. It is extraordinary because since Emperor Kangxi, it has been stipulated that the descendants of the royal family should be named with two characters. The first character indicates seniority, and the second character has the same radical, indicating brotherhood. Pu Lun&#39;s father&#39;s original name was Zai Zhong. In December of the fourth year of Xianfeng, he was adopted by Emperor Daoguang Emperor&#39;s eldest son Yiwei as his heir. He became the eldest grandson of Emperor Dao Guang and was renamed Zai Zhi. Pu Lun was the eldest son of Zai Zhi and the great-eldest grandson of Emperor Daoguang. Pujia is the eldest son of Puyi&#39;s seventh uncle Zaitao. Zaitao is the younger brother of Puyi&#39;s father and regent Zaifeng. They are both the half-brothers of Emperor Guangxu Zaiyan. Therefore, Puyi and Pujia were cousins. The eldest brother Puyi, the fifth brother Punu, and the sixth brother Pujian are all the grandsons of the fifth son of Emperor Daoguang, Yigui. Specifically, Puyi is the eldest son of Yigui’s fourth son, Zaiying, and the fifth brother Punu is his younger brother. ; The sixth brother Pujian is the sixth son of Zaiying&#39;s third brother Zailan. Therefore, they are all very close to Puyi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/WpeIDbimA1gUDZWzcEnsdRZ6e3nbYe3bHR40s26U.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;557&quot; height= &quot;728&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/WpeIDbimA1gUDZWzcEnsdRZ6e3nbYe3bHR40s26U.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251309&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1910, Puyi (right) took a photo with his father, the regent Zaifeng, and his brother Pujie. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the above-mentioned cousins, Puyi also has two half-brothers, three The younger brother Pu Bo and the fourth younger brother Pu Ren also have the second character of their names next to the character &quot;任&quot;. Pujie is Puyi&#39;s younger brother. The two have the closest relationship and get along most harmoniously. When he was young, Pujie was not only qualified to be Puyi&#39;s companion, he could also enter the palace and play with Puyi. When he grew up, he also helped Puyi plan his plans to go abroad. Logically speaking, Pujie&#39;s name should also include the word &quot;任&quot; next to it! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person&#39;s name seems to be just a symbol, but from the moment the person is born, this name carries rich cultural information and cultural connotations. It can be a human recognition of new life; it can also express parents&#39; expectations for everlasting love; at the same time, it is also full of the ancestors&#39; hope for the prosperity of future generations, and individuals must flourish in this branch. He found his place in Mao&#39;s genealogy, and all his family glory and family missions came from this. What cannot be ignored is that a person&#39;s name also contains various historical factors, which are related to the destiny of the times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, when choosing which words to name children and grandchildren, elders must not only consider the pronunciation of the word, whether the word and the surname are read harmoniously, and try to avoid misunderstandings caused by certain homophonics; You must consider the meaning contained in this word, whether the word itself is positive or negative, and whether there is any taboo. In a traditional clan society, the relationship between this word and the family genealogy will definitely be considered. Sometimes, this relationship is expressed through phonology, such as Xu Shichang and his younger brother Xu Shiguang, and his younger brothers Xu Shigang, Xu Shiliang, Xu Shifang, Xu Shiyang, Xu Shixiang, Xu Shizhang, etc. The last characters all rhyme with Jiangyang. More often, it is expressed through glyphs. For example, Zeng Guofan, a famous official of the Zhongxing Dynasty in the Qing Dynasty, his younger brothers Zeng Guohuang, Zeng Guobao, Zeng Guoquan, etc. all have the name &quot;艹&quot;; another example is Mr. Zhou Shaoliang, a famous contemporary scholar, who named his daughters respectively Qixiu, Qizhang, and Qiyu all follow this tradition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, where did the word &quot;任&quot; in Mr. Pujie&#39;s name go? If you read the traditional Chinese version of the family genealogy, the problem will be easily solved, because there is another traditional Chinese character for &quot;Jie&quot; in the ancient books, written as &quot;Jie&quot;. As a calligrapher and painter, Mr. Pu Jie used the inscription &quot;Pu Jie&quot; on some of his paintings and calligraphy works, and also wrote &quot;Pu Jie&quot; on his seal. In this way, it can be understood that Mr. Pujie did not change his name, nor was he adopted by other royal families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/l1HBRsfJHAWvJvNvkIlpuxdo2NqRJRFAnKtDKuOE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;440&quot; height= &quot;646&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/l1HBRsfJHAWvJvNvkIlpuxdo2NqRJRFAnKtDKuOE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251311&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The title, title and seal on the title page of &quot;The Autobiography of Pujie&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be pointed out that &quot;Jie&quot; and &quot;Jie&quot; are not simply related in traditional and simplified Chinese. In ancient books, the words &quot;Jie&quot; and &quot;Jie&quot; coexist. They have the same pronunciation and most of the time the same meaning. They both mean towering, outstanding and full of praise, such as &quot;outstanding&quot; and &quot;masterpiece&quot;, so although the two The glyphs of the characters are different, so they can usually be read together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/TBskXM88DDttCrtkWjC4J5P0m2bEYDMWVvAa65I7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1044&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/TBskXM88DDttCrtkWjC4J5P0m2bEYDMWVvAa65I7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251312&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Jie, the first number one scholar from Shaanxi in the Qing Dynasty, and his seven-character couplet in running script (now in the Shenyang Palace Museum). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, precisely because the glyphs of the two characters are different, there are also special circumstances that cannot be used universally, especially When using it as a person&#39;s name, be very careful. For example, during the Qianjia period of the Qing Dynasty, there was a famous figure named Wang Jie. Even in ancient books, his name cannot be written as &quot;Wang Jie&quot;. First let’s talk about why he is famous. He was the number one scholar appointed by Emperor Qianlong and the first number one scholar in Shaanxi since the founding of the Qing Dynasty. When Emperor Jiaqing came to the throne, he, as the first assistant, participated in the impeachment case of He Shen. It can be said that he is the pride of Shaanxi people. Wang Jie is good at poetry and writing, and is good at calligraphy. His seven-character couplet in running script is collected in the Shenyang Palace Museum: &quot;In the rainy night, I leisurely chant Zuo Si&#39;s sentence, and when the weather is clear, I quickly imitate Youjun&#39;s calligraphy.&quot; Why does his name have to be written as &quot;Wang Jie&quot; in ancient books? There are two reasons: on the one hand, based on the signature of Wang Jie’s inscriptions and calligraphy works. On his inscription or signature, there are two characters &quot;Wang Jie&quot;. On the other hand, according to the names of brothers Wang Jie. Wang Jie has two older brothers, one named Wang Rong and the other named Wang Che. On the surface, Wang Jie&#39;s names have nothing to do with his brother&#39;s names. Their radicals are not consistent. One is &quot;氵&quot; and the other is &quot;灬&quot;. But those who have practiced calligraphy can understand the kinship between the two at a glance. The right part of his brother&#39;s name &quot;Rong&quot; and &quot;Che&quot; has a dot on the right side, both of which are four dots. By the way, it can be mentioned that due to the same cultural tradition, the name of Emperor Qianlong Hongli should be written as &quot;Hongli&quot; rather than &quot;Hongli&quot; in ancient books, because Emperor Qianlong&#39;s brothers in descending order were named respectively The names Honghui, Honghan, Hongyun, Hongshi, Hongzhou and Hongluo all use the word &quot;日&quot; as the radical, indicating that they are from the same family genealogy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should the name of Puyi&#39;s brother be written as &quot;Pu Jie&quot; or &quot;Pu Jie&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we talk about cultural traditions, it should undoubtedly be written as &quot;Pu Jie&quot;, so that we can see at a glance his relationship with Pu Yi and Pu Lun. However, with the strong call for writing reform, if you want to simplify it, just simplify it. Writing &quot;Jie&quot; is not bad either. Therefore, we see that Mr. Pu Jie often made &quot;outstanding&quot; remarks when he signed his signature. If this is his personal wish, we should respect it. However, if we think about people and the world, he will probably be lucky that the seal can still protect his true name intact, and he will stamp this seal firmly at the signature every time. This kind of cultural psychology is probably not easy for modern people to understand or feel. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbSP; bsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 22:25:09 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国际奥委会成立电子竞技委员会：电竞会成为奥运项目吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257312]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 6, 2023, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach announced that a new e-sports will be established committee. The establishment of the E-Sports Committee is the latest move by the International Olympic Committee to support the development of virtual Olympic sports. From an organizational perspective, this is an organizational-level upgrade of the e-sports contact group established by the International Olympic Committee in 2018, highlighting the IOC’s recognition of the huge development potential of e-sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is still controversial, in recent years, e-sports has become a formal &quot;sport&quot;. In June 2023, Singapore held its first &quot;Olympic Esports Week&quot; and &quot;Olympic Esports Series&quot;, inviting professional and amateur players from around the world to participate in the competition. At the upcoming Asian Games in Hangzhou, e-sports will become an official event of the Asian Games for the first time and will be included in the national medal list. It is an &quot;intellectual event&quot; like chess events, covering 5 PC-side events and two mobile game-side events. Generate 7 gold medals. On July 8, the Asian Olympic Council announced that e-sports will be included in the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The establishment of the International Olympic Committee’s E-Sports Committee indicates that e-Sports is one step closer to officially entering the Olympic Games and becoming a permanent project. It reflects the International Olympic Committee’s further awareness of the value of esports to the Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;E-sports can bring huge benefits to the Olympic Games. In 2023, the global e-sports audience is expected to reach 574 million, with global e-sports revenue approaching US$1.8 billion. The entry of e-sports into the Olympic Games will further expand this revenue. The International Olympic Committee also values ​​this. After all, any organization needs money to survive and develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The foundation of e-sports is the video game industry. Video games originated in the United States in the 1950s. In the 1980s, with the popularization of televisions and the development of computer hardware, they became popular. By the mid-1990s, with the rise of multimedia technology, games entered a period of rapid development. With the advent of the digital age and the popularization of smartphones, the game industry has grown explosively, from the earliest home computer games to today&#39;s multi-platform, multi-user online games. Video games have become the largest industry in entertainment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The revenue of the game industry now far exceeds the movie box office. Affected by the epidemic, the global movie box office has just exceeded 21.4 billion US dollars in 2022. Before the epidemic, the global movie box office in 2019 was 42.5 billion US dollars. It&#39;s the highest record. Looking back at the gaming industry, according to a report released by market research organization Newzoo, the global gaming market revenue is estimated to be US$187.7 billion in 2023. Among them, the mobile market is expected to reach US$92.6 billion, which also reflects the status of mobile games in the gaming industry. From an audience perspective, globally, the number of game players will grow from 2.9 billion in 2020 to 3.5 billion in 2025, with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 4.2%. There is a view that the huge market size and audience size make games the ninth art after the eight major art forms such as painting, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry (literature), dance, drama, and film (film and television). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of the game industry gave birth to e-sports. More and more players not only play games, but also watch game competitions. To a certain extent, this is the “sport” with the largest number of participants and the best mass base in the world. Whether it is traditional client games or emerging mobile games, they all play an important role in e-sports events. For example, the Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports projects include League of Legends, Honor of Kings Asian Games version, Peace Elite Asian Games version, and FIFA Online 4. These games are the games with the largest audience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of the broad base of video games, e-sports has become a bridge between the Olympic Games and young groups. Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee, said, &quot;Virtual sports can supplement and strengthen the potential of traditional Olympic sports, and it will provide new opportunities for athletes and spectators to participate in the Olympic movement.&quot; “We believe that virtual sports can help promote the values ​​of excellence, friendship and respect that are at the heart of the Olympic Games and can inspire young people around the world to participate in sport and develop active and healthy lifestyles.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it should be noted that the interest game of e-sports entering the Olympics is more complicated than traditional projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Traditional sports are often born out of sports with a long history. They are not themselves a commercial product, and there are no intellectual property rights or controllers. Therefore, the International Olympic Committee can control them relatively independently and completely. . But video games are different. They were born out of business from the beginning. As a sports industry that integrates entertainment, technology, competition, live broadcasting, and social networking, e-sports has achieved mature operations and formed a relatively complete industrial chain. This means that e-sports itself is &quot;owned&quot;. In addition to game manufacturers, each link in the industry chain itself has a mature business model to undertake a series of benefits generated by being an Olympic project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, to a certain extent, when e-sports enters the Olympics, there is a complicated game of interests and a battle for control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While establishing the e-sports committee, the International Olympic Committee also reiterated their definition of e-sports: e-sports is virtual sports (Esports based on Traditional Sports), not gaming e-sports (Gaming) Esports). &quot;Virtual sports&quot; are a supplement and enhancement of &quot;traditional Olympic events&quot;, a supporting role of traditional sports, and will still accept the all-round leadership of traditional sports forces. Judging from the member structure of the Olympic Esports Committee, the same is true. Most of them come from individual sports federations and senior marketing and media personnel in the traditional sports industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the International Olympic Committee insists on two points and will not give in. First, traditional sports must lead e-sports; second, competition content must comply with Olympic standards, and manufacturers must compromise on the red line of game content review. Based on these two points, the International Olympic Committee may require the selection of games or even customize games with its own intellectual property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But at the same time, Olympic projects must also be selected from games on the market, otherwise there will be no audience. This dependence not only refers to game manufacturers, but also includes sales networks, marketing, live broadcasts, and video platforms. Therefore, the Olympic Committee cannot do without the e-sports industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a completely new situation. The tug-of-war over the inclusion of e-sports in the Olympics will continue for a long time, which will also affect the schedule for e-sports to eventually enter the Olympics as an official event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[开幕前夕，南周记者探访亚运主媒体中心，打卡亚运灯光秀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257306]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/feZ3faeodBYoUOUsBHkXT2KsjB0x8PG0LdHR2pps.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/feZ3faeodBYoUOUsBHkXT2KsjB0x8PG0Ld HR2pps. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251534&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, 2023, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, a young man raised his mobile phone to take pictures Light show in Qianjiang New Town. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/ TvkAafdG4SSIvpvXbdhqUs7bz10NG4OrecmTMy4s.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;676&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/TvkAafdG4SSIvpvXbdhqUs7bz10NG4OrecmTMy4s. jpg&quot; data- key=&quot;251535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, a franchise store in the main media center of the Asian Games, a A customer is selecting Asian Games souvenirs. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 19th Asian Games will open in Hangzhou, Zhejiang on September 23, 2023.

Under the guidance of their master, they set up two greenhouses, one planted cherry radish, snow greens, and peppers, and the other planted 4,000 pots of roses. They raised 8 ewes, 22 male lambs, 200 kilograms of shrimps, etc. They re-tiled the floor and painted the walls of the house. Zhao Xiaotong, who is good at drawing, painted cartoon images of 10 of them on the exterior wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/fY5oLodvrUNeg3oH5Pq5PmGeIDffhN8tCIFBoZAO.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/fY5oLodvrUNeg3oH5Pq5PmGeIDffhN8tCIFBoZAO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250539&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;10 young people established a company called &quot;Ten Qintian&quot;, and they wore their own customized work clothes&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(&quot;Farming Bar&quot; program group/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For related reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/254587&quot;>;10 young people, 142 acres of land, a 200-day life tempering experiment&lt;/a>;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;On the surface, &quot;Farm!&quot; &quot;Youth&quot; is a documentary program whose main content is agricultural work and rural life. But what attracts the audience is the fact that 10 frustrated and confused young people who don&#39;t know each other go through trials together with the hope of working hard to do one thing well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 21, 2023, the company of 10 young people was officially established, called Shiqintian, which is a homophone of &quot;Ten Sunny Days&quot;, because they communicated in desperate moments on rainy and snowy days. I always want to wait for a sunny day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audience was moved by the sweat, blood and energy of the 10 young people to overcome difficulties. Life on the screen provides the audience with a beautiful parallel time and space: there is no elimination mechanism, and there is little competition between people; young people are allowed to be kind to others, help each other, and keep trying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the middle of the show, some viewers said that Houdoumen was a utopia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before entering the entertainment industry, Zhao Yibo was a standard social animal. He worked in an advertising company and was always in a competitive relationship. The price of saying the wrong thing may be losing the client he has worked so hard to maintain. He entered the back door in 100% working condition, but unexpectedly he relaxed here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Jiang Dunhao, who had always been slow to show off, came here, his inner barrier to interacting with others was lowered. Chen Shaoxi, who always lives alone, solves his serious mental internal conflict here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Zhuo wants to do things well, but always makes mistakes. Raising roses is stressful, and he is worried about not doing well in every step. The brothers stayed up late with him to make flowers on the assembly line, but he felt guilty for causing trouble to others. Li Hao, who is good at observing people, noticed Lu Zhuo&#39;s emotions of thinking about others but suppressing himself. In a commercial, Li Hao filmed Lu Zhuo as a clown who closed the door to heal himself, opened the door and infected everyone with his smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Haonan hopes that everyone will be happy, stay together happily, and often help others without asking for anything in return. Zhao Xiaotong is stubborn, but everyone is willing to accommodate his stubborn character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One morning in May 2023, Zhuo Yuan was wearing a supermarket uniform and watched the hydroponic lettuce they grew being packaged, weighed, and put on the shelves. After the supermarket opened, the lettuce was quickly sold by early-morning customers. Older people and viewers who know ten days are short. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Housoumen has become a landmark. Li Gengyun built a flower bed for Houdoumen, planted several kinds of plants, and watered them every day. Some of them bloomed overnight, and some bloomed for a short period of time and faded in two days. But after they were cut off, new ones bloomed. The buds will grow, and &quot;life comes one after another, passed on over and over again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yiheng thought of the smell of Houdoumen and described it as &quot;the smell of vitality.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“灵活就业”的毕业生，和一轮针对性核查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257294]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在“被强奸”漩涡中挣扎八天后，一位44岁农妇选择自杀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257255]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The old house hidden under the trees, Yi Yonghong&#39;s self-report of being &quot;raped&quot; The place where the incident occurred.

(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On July 23, 2023, Yi Yonghong decided to commit suicide. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She placed the suicide note on the plastic stool at the head of the bed, and her purse and mobile phone, which she never left behind, were neatly placed beside the bed. The purse contained more than 3,000 yuan in cash. She locked the door and ignored the clothes in the washing machine. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m leaving. I don&#39;t know what to do to make you less hurt...I don&#39;t ask for your forgiveness. I just hope that you will live a happy life and forget that I am a bad wife and mother.&quot; .&quot; She said in her suicide note. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To commit suicide, she chose a mile away. She had to pass through a large guava field. The unripe fruits wrapped in white plastic bags were hung all over the orchard. They were the fruits of her summer. The guava tree is not high, so you have to bend down when walking through it, and you have to cross a drainage ditch in three to five steps. The last section of the road is a slope about two meters high. Climb up and you will reach the embankment. A wide pond with a wide water surface slowly unfolds in front of you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The embankment is covered with mimosa, lush and green. The pair of pink slippers were neatly placed on the steps by Yi Yonghong, with the toes facing the pond. A few hours later, her husband Cheng Shanzhi discovered her. She was wearing a red top and floating in a prone position in the middle of the pond. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Eight days before committing suicide, at the age of 44, she reported that she was raped by fruit vendor Huang Mouguan. The police decided not to file the case because the existing evidence could not prove that a crime had occurred. After committing suicide, the police decided to open a case for investigation on September 7 because &quot;new evidence was discovered.&quot; In order to prove that she was raped, she was preserved in an ice coffin and underwent a craniotomy and a thoracotomy for an autopsy. &lt;/p>;&lt;h4>;Misfortune in the banana fields&lt;/h4>;&lt;p>;Typhoon Taili is approaching. Before the violent storm arrived, Yi Yonghong had to cut down more than 20 acres of plantains at home. Nine years ago, this couple from Yongzhou, Hunan, planted fruits on a contracted land in Wenchang, Hainan. Now the contracted land covers nearly 50 acres, half of which is planted with bananas and the other half with guava. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yi Yonghong’s WeChat chat records show that on the evening of July 14, she and Huang Mouguan finalized the time to harvest bananas the next day. Huang Mouguan opened a fruit wholesale stall near the busiest park in Wenchang, and would go to fruit farmers&#39; homes to buy fruit. In the Wenchang area, most of the fruit growers are outsiders who have crossed the Qiongzhou Strait to make a living, and most of the fruit vendors are Hainan locals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yi Yonghong rarely goes out in public to sell bananas, and spends most of her time working in the banana fields. In early 2023, Yi Yonghong&#39;s husband Cheng Shanzhi started doing business with Huang Mouguan after being introduced by a fellow villager. By the time the incident occurred, he had sold bananas to him five times in total, with a transaction volume of 1,480 yuan. In the first two times, Cheng Shanzhi cut down plantains and traded them with Huang Mouguan. Because her husband&#39;s left ankle was seriously cut due to an accident, Yi Yonghong took over the job of cutting plantains for the next three times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was these three experiences of selling bananas alone that pushed Yi Yonghong&#39;s life to a point of no return. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The banana land contracted by Yi Yonghong and his wife is not close to the village where she rents, and it takes half an hour by electric bicycle. In 2014, they built a shelter house using hollow bricks next to the plantain field. There was no other house within a radius of 200 meters. When we moved out in 2022, there was only a guard dog and a few free-range chickens left there. The unused old house began to fall into dust and became desolate. There was no longer a fire in the kitchen, and no one could sleep on the bed. Except for resting when working, Yi Yonghong rarely came here. The airtight trees almost swallowed up the small house. house. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The old house at the crime scene.

(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The first time Yi Yonghong took over for her husband who injured his foot and cut bananas alone with Huang Mouguan was on July 2. To cut bananas, vendors usually go to the fields to select the bananas, and the farmers carry them to the field, where they are finally weighed and loaded onto trucks. Yi Yonghong seems to particularly like pink. She has a short-sleeved shirt of this color, which she wears specially when working. Her right shoulder is covered with dark green glue marks from banana. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yi Yonghong later told her husband that that time, Huang Mouguan took the opportunity to help her carry the banana on his shoulders and touched her breasts. He also said to her: &quot;Don&#39;t do such hard work, I will give you money.&quot; Yi Yonghong refused him: &quot;Don&#39;t say this, we are doing hard work to earn hard money, I am not that Plant people.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No more evidence can be obtained for what happened in the banana field. Other merchants next to Huang Mouguan&#39;s fruit shop said they had not seen him for more than a month after the incident. On the afternoon of September 2, Huang&#39;s wife was selling fruit at a stall next to the shop. She was emotional and refused to be interviewed: &quot;You don&#39;t know how much impact they have on our lives. I am under great pressure.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A week later, the bananas had to be picked again, and Yi Yonghong and Huang Mouguan were once again in a deserted place where vegetation was growing wildly&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[古龙：人在江湖，身不由己丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257298]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[交通运输部：中秋国庆假期小型客车免收通行费]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257286]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 10 o&#39;clock today (September 21), the State Council Information Office held a press conference.

Among them, &quot;rumor information&quot; and &quot;leak information&quot; are relatively easy to understand, and the corresponding penalties include &quot;defamation&quot; and &quot;infringement of commercial secrets&quot;. In comparison, the definition of &quot;insulting information&quot; is much shorter: &quot;information that attacks and insults companies or entrepreneurs, spoofs portraits of entrepreneurs, maliciously associates with pornographic and vulgar topics, etc.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of the &quot;Guidelines for Reporting Enterprise-related Internet Infringement Information&quot; is to protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises and entrepreneurs, improve the efficiency of reporting enterprise-related infringement information, and maintain a good business environment. Among them, the formulation of &quot;spoofing entrepreneur portraits&quot; is more attention-grabbing and deserves in-depth analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the basis for &quot;spoofing entrepreneur portraits&quot; is &quot;online infringement information&quot;, which originates from Article 1019 of the &quot;Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, &quot;No organization or individual may vilify or defame, Or use information technology means to forge and infringe on the portrait rights of others.&quot; According to this law, &quot;spoofs of entrepreneur portraits&quot; will constitute infringement if they are proven to be &quot;uglified&quot; or &quot;forged.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, spoofing portraits of entrepreneurs is not necessarily directly equivalent to &quot;vilification&quot; or &quot;forgery.&quot; For example, if an entrepreneur&#39;s portrait is turned into an emoticon or a cartoon character, it does not necessarily constitute &quot;uglification&quot; or &quot;forgery.&quot; Compared with &quot;attacking and abusing entrepreneurs&quot;, &quot;spoof portraits&quot; also have elements of ridicule and humor, and are often beautified and praised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the actual situation, most of the entrepreneurs spoofed by netizens are famous and successful entrepreneurs. They have strong industry influence and social popularity, and they are already public figures themselves. As public figures, entrepreneurs&#39; lives and work have attracted widespread attention, and their words and deeds are closely related to public interests. As a special group in society, the portraits of well-known entrepreneurs have become a piece of &quot;public knowledge&quot; well known to the public. As public figures, they also bear certain obligations of tolerance and bear certain derogation of interests in their portrait rights. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, it is necessary to refine the identification criteria to determine whether &quot;parody images of entrepreneurs&#39; portraits&quot; constitute &quot;insulting information&quot; and &quot;corporate-related infringement information.&quot; This leads to the second question: How will entrepreneurs protect their rights once faced with &quot;spoof portrait pictures&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, complaints from public figures against netizens for “portrait rights infringement” are often concentrated in the entertainment industry. More than one entertainment star has been very angry about &quot;spoof portrait pictures&quot;, which has triggered many legal lawsuits. According to statistics from the &quot;Southern Metropolis Daily&quot; on April 18, 2023, the China Judgment Document Network disclosed 356 civil cases related to celebrities&#39; portrait rights in 2022. Among them, the proportion of celebrities winning the lawsuit is very high, &quot;Ge You complained about &#39;Ge You lying down&#39; &quot;It has an almost complete winning rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparatively speaking, entrepreneurs encounter spoof portraits. Almost no well-known entrepreneur can escape the &quot;spoof&quot; of netizens, such as Lei Jun&#39;s &quot;are you OK&quot; and Wang Jianlin&#39;s &quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the hundreds of millions&quot;, Robin Li &quot;what&#39;s your problem&quot;, etc. However, the leading entrepreneurs who were pranked did not feel that this was an insult or infringement on themselves, and they did not take legal action. Not only that, some entrepreneurs will actively join in the spoof and use it as a marketing tool to get closer to consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the alleged infringement liability of &quot;spoof portrait pictures&quot;, most of them belong to personality rights disputes, and the most serious cases point to the &quot;crime of insult&quot;. Article 246 of the Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China stipulates that the crime of insult refers to &quot;the use of violence or other methods to openly tarnish the reputation of others and the circumstances are serious.&quot; The crime of insult is a crime of circumstance. The perpetrator&#39;s behavior of openly insulting others must reach the level of &quot;serious circumstances&quot; to constitute a crime and be investigated. This crime falls under the category of &quot;no complaint, no action&quot;, that is, no action will be taken until a complaint is made, except for cases that seriously endanger social order and national interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If entrepreneurs themselves are spreading their own spoof portraits, emoticons and even ghost videos, it is naturally even less likely that the outside world will consider this to be an infringement of the entrepreneur. Therefore, as long as the entrepreneur himself does not feel dissatisfied, similar behavior should be tolerated. If an entrepreneur really believes that &quot;spoof pictures&quot; are insulting or infringing, then he certainly has the right to initiate legal proceedings and use legal weapons to protect his legitimate rights and interests like ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, we can see that well-known entrepreneurs generally have a tolerant and generous attitude towards life when faced with attacks, abuses, and pranks. After all, compared with the turbulent waves of the business world, &quot;portraits being pranked&quot; are sometimes an extra boost for entrepreneurs and a small comment on the &quot;entrepreneurial spirit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[苦等五年，第二批罕见病目录公布：新增86个病种]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257274]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 13:15:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/Cig8PapifnL34jPiIf4CiVkuwLzvF8PVvESVrRTB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1082&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/Cig8PapifnL34jPiIf4CiVkuwLzvF8PVvESV rRTB. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251495&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 7, 2022, Xiamen Maternal and Child Health Hospital, medical staff sampled rare diseases Noxinaxen Sodium Injection, a specific drug for spinal muscular atrophy, is ready to be injected into children. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 20, 2023, the official website of the National Health Commission announced the second batch of rare disease catalogs. Add 86 rare diseases such as achondroplasia to the catalog, and the registration date is September 18. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“(This is) something that everyone has been calling for for a long time.” For Huang Rufang, founder of the Coude Rare Disease Center, as well as many rare disease patients and related medical professionals, this is a five-year battle. Much eager waiting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2018, five departments including the National Health Commission jointly formulated the &quot;First Batch Rare Disease Catalog&quot;, which for the first time disclosed 121 rare diseases to the public in the form of a catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This catalog provides an important basis for various departments to formulate policies related to rare diseases. The health department organizes efforts to clarify diagnosis and treatment guidelines for these diseases one by one, and relies on industry organizations to carry out training for medical personnel to improve the standardized diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. ability. At the same time, a series of supporting systems have been introduced to strengthen the research and development of rare disease-related drugs, accelerate review and approval, and access to medical insurance, which have greatly improved the current situation of rare disease diagnosis and treatment in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, a total of 207 rare diseases have been included in the two batches of rare disease catalogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/E5gEIt4kPP1SGOGXeuadq6Dpjbou9c1Y4Hh1lnJl.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;914&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/E5gEIt4kPP1SGOGXeuadq6Dpjbou9c1Y4Hh1lnJl.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251496&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture of the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Many I have never heard of the disease.&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;To be honest, I have never heard of many diseases, and I don’t know what to say.&quot; Xing Huanping of Meier SMA Care Center saw She told Southern Weekend reporters after the second batch of rare disease catalogues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 20 million rare disease patients in China, the SMA (spinal muscular atrophy) patients helped by Xing Huanping are lucky to have technological breakthroughs from pharmaceutical companies and good opportunities from government reforms. In 2018, SMA was also included in the first batch of rare disease catalogs, and two innovative drugs for symptomatic treatment were approved for marketing in China and entered the national medical insurance catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many rare disease patients and families who were not included in the first batch of catalogs are looking forward to the second batch of catalogs being released, hoping that their diseases will be included in the catalog, so that everyone can at least be seen and have access to the list. More hope.&quot; Xing Huanping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past five years, all sectors of society have paid close attention to the expansion of this &quot;niche&quot; directory, and the National Health Commission has also disclosed the progress. In February 2022, the &quot;Reply to Recommendation No. 9415 of the Fourth Session of the Thirteenth National People&#39;s Congress&quot; published on the official website of the National Health Commission mentioned that the selection process for the second batch of rare disease catalogs has been launched in due course in accordance with regulations and is in the process of material review. stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to that time, the National Health Commission had successively received applications for adding disease categories submitted by relevant departments, &quot;more than 200 copies of relevant materials.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why are these rare diseases included? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are more than 7,000 rare diseases in the world, and there are more than 1,000 rare diseases in China. Therefore, catalog selection needs to be very cautious and scientific. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Working Procedures for Formulating the Catalog of Rare Diseases&quot; issued by the National Health Commission in May 2018, the catalog should be formulated based on national conditions and fully combined with factors such as economic development, population situation, and social security levels. And refer to the management experience of countries or regions with similar social development levels to our country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The diseases included in the catalog should meet the following conditions at the same time: there is international and domestic evidence that the incidence or prevalence is low; it is harmful to patients and families; there are clear diagnostic methods; there are treatment or intervention methods , affordable, or there is no effective treatment or intervention but it has been included in the national scientific research project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in November 2019, the China Rare Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Service Information System established and developed by the National Health Commission was put into use, and 324 hospitals in the National Rare Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Collaboration Network began to use the system to register rare disease cases. Work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This system has collected information on about 500,000 rare disease patients. This information is of great significance for gradually understanding the number and distribution of rare disease patients in my country, diagnosis and treatment bottlenecks, disease burden and difficulties, etc. It has important guiding value for government departments to formulate a more scientific and reasonable national strategic plan for rare diseases.&quot; the National Health Commission mentioned in the aforementioned reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There will be more challenges in the future”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ma Tao, Executive Secretary of the Beijing Sickness Challenge Charity Foundation, learned that the second batch of catalogs was announced, and the first Immediately, I forwarded the news to the WeChat group where my colleagues and the person in charge of the patient organization belong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“On the whole, some of the diseases included in the second batch of catalogs have related patient organizations. These rare disease patient organizations have also done a lot of appeals in recent years, and everyone’s efforts have finally come to fruition. .&quot; Ma Tao told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After calming down, Ma Tao, who has been paying attention to rare diseases for many years, thought that the release of the second batch of catalogs might be the beginning of another long journey. How to diagnose, treat, protect and return more diseases to society requires joint attention and investment of resources from all walks of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that in addition to rare disease organizations, some pharmaceutical companies with related rare disease drug research and development also successively forwarded news of the second batch of catalog announcements on the 20th, such as Zai Lab, Langyu group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There will be more challenges in the future. For the Pain Challenge Foundation team, our service scope and service capabilities also need to quickly adjust and improve, and continue to work hard.&quot; Ma Tao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/lrktG44jOOsvFv6MGB3BeOCFImNK4k0GmWYA4lAm.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;984&quot; height= &quot;1152&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/lrktG44jOOsvFv6MGB3BeOCFImNK4k0GmWYA4lAm.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251497&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/xTVCDAsUlGlKwYhATyMOTbndqtmWN86cFIIMJfxX.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;958&quot; height=&quot;1174&quot; data-src=&quot;//images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/xTVCDAsUlGlKwYhATyMOTbndqtmWN86cFIIMJfxX.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251500&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/09/21/odwQpM9PwOk0QfEGV1yAfwXjkVUxWKGa5xxp2s6Q.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;966&quot; height=&quot;1172&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/odwQpM9PwOk0QfEGV1yAfwXjkVUxWKGa5xxp2s6Q.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251498&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Screenshot/picture of the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/V0dpaBgEqDAfsmKEB5WCxy6jOvBiogAMhDqrBF0W. png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;948&quot; height=&quot;1170&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/V0dpaBgEqDAfsmKEB5WCxy6jOvBiogAMhDqrBF0W.png&quot; data-key= &quot;251499&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture of the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/TsYEQMGbCvSpIMNw7927zlhOaQunMAzCsHpssWuj.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;948&quot; height=&quot;1054&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/TsYEQMGbCvSpIMNw7927zlhOaQunMAzCsHpssWuj.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251501&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“特产互寄”走红，不出门体验当地特色，真的香吗]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257222]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
