The &quot;remove, rectify, and retain&quot; measures taken by the five departments to &quot;remove, rectify, and retain&quot; &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; just allow the outside world to rethink the true connotation of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; and analyze the right and wrong behind &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official definition of the so-called &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; refers to &quot;long history, products, skills or services that have been passed down from generation to generation, with a distinctive traditional Chinese cultural background and profound cultural heritage, and have gained widespread social recognition.&quot; recognition and form a brand with good reputation.” From the literal meaning, &quot;inherited from generation to generation&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;historical and cultural traditional value&quot;, while &quot;products, skills or services are widely recognized by society&quot; can be reduced to &quot;commercial reputation and market status&quot;, which is also the construction of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;. &quot;Two pillars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The connotation of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; is the &quot;traditional cultural background and profound cultural heritage&quot; behind it, or is it the market position and business reputation won in competition? The two cases in this notice can be said to be the answer to this question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the &quot;time-honored brands&quot; that have been removed from the list, Inner Mongolia Dashengkui and Anhui Beggar Chicken are two typical cases: Dashengkui lasted for hundreds of years from the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty to the Anti-Japanese War. &quot;Yin Yuan Bao Pu&quot; ruled two thousand miles of trade routes in Mongolia. When it resumed business more than ten years ago, it also placed many people&#39;s expectations on reviving the old brand; Anhui beggar&#39;s chicken is said to date back to the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty. Although this legend is false and true , but the reason why it was expelled from the &quot;time-honored brand&quot; is not its historical and cultural authenticity, but its poor management in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that the history of Dashengkui is more authentic, but this does not save it from the bad luck of being &quot;delisted&quot;; Anhui Beggar Chicken has doubts about its history and culture alone, but the last thing that crushed it The straw is probably not an academic verification of authenticity, but a defeat in the competition in the modern catering market. In fact, there is more than one &quot;Beggar&#39;s Chicken&quot;. The &quot;Daoxiang Village&quot; and &quot;Guanshengyuan&quot; that have been removed from the list this time also have brands with the same name. The reason why they failed to pass the review of &quot;Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot; is not because of &quot;historical and cultural traditional value&quot; &quot;Something went wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, for these &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;, if they cannot embrace the latest changes in the market and cannot innovate themselves to meet the needs of consumers, they will inevitably die out; conversely, if a brand can Create brand new products and services, and even if they are not old, they will slowly occupy the minds of consumers and become a new tradition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Western academic circles have long noticed the phenomenon of &quot;invention of tradition&quot;: those &quot;traditions&quot; that appear or claim to be ancient often originate quite recently, and are sometimes even invented. . This is not uncommon in the Chinese context, which is the common phenomenon of &quot;replying family trees&quot; and &quot;recognizing ancestors&quot;. The &quot;traditional origins&quot; recognized by many &quot;time-honored brands&quot; are often suspected of being attached to others in academic circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facts have proved that whether a tradition really has historical and cultural continuity value and whether it is really academically tenable is not determined by whether the tradition is widely accepted. The key factor is not even important. Regardless of these &quot;time-honored brands&quot;, even emerging companies that have not been established for a long time often have to make some &quot;inventions&quot; and even &quot;legends&quot; in the &quot;brand story&quot;, but no consumer will be like a professional historian. If we continue to delve deeper into how much of this is true and how false, we will be more inclined to spread these wonderful stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such cases abound in China, Europe and the United States. The history of &quot;A diamond is forever, a diamond will last forever&quot; is actually not that long ago, but this advertising slogan and the brand value behind it seem to have existed since ancient times. The untenable &quot;tradition&quot; can still win over consumers. The &quot;Eight Major Cuisines&quot; often claim to have thousands of years of history, but their true origins can often only be traced back to the mid-Qing Dynasty. However, this has not affected the reputation of the major cuisines. After all, food must be felt by the tip of the tongue, and consumers I don&#39;t care much about whether its history is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this does not mean that the authenticity of &quot;time-honored brands&quot; is not important at all. &quot;Century-old stores&quot; that &quot;look fake at first glance&quot; will still make people see through their tricks, and then be suspected of false propaganda. In other words, only the quality of goods and services, consumer choices, and market judgment can enable a company and its brand to gain business credibility, consolidate the company&#39;s brand value, help companies spread their own brand stories, and let &quot;time-honored&quot; brands The brand stands. If a &quot;time-honored brand&quot; becomes a company&#39;s &quot;talisman&quot; and makes the company feel that it can &quot;win&quot; by relying on it, and even relies on the brand&#39;s long-standing mass base to not improve its business management and pay attention to the quality of its products and services, then the result will be in name only. I can&#39;t even keep my name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, for a &quot;time-honored enterprise&quot;, the directory and trademark are only the surface, and long-lasting business reputation is the inside. A &quot;Chinese time-honored brand&quot; can maintain its business reputation not by a directory or a trademark, but by the sincere recognition of it as a traditional Chinese brand by consumers. The changes of the times will eliminate some &quot;time-honored brands&quot;, retain some time-honored brands, and also create a number of new &quot;time-honored brands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[奶茶按公斤炫！新疆人豪横起来连东北人都害怕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260575]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, milk tea in Xinjiang has become a hot topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some netizens posted pictures showing that when buying milk tea in Xinjiang, a cup starts at 1kg, triggering heated discussions among the public about the &quot;bigness&quot; of Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The air in Xinjiang seems to be filled with baking powder, and food will &quot;expand&quot; several times once it arrives in Xinjiang. For example, 10 kinds of Xinjiang delicacies, including Xinjiang’s No. 1 Nang, Big Plate of Chicken, Noodle Soup for Ten Thousands of People, Largest Oil Cake Tower, and Rice Pilaf for Ten Thousand People, have all set Guinness World Records for their “bigness”. Compared with milk tea that starts at 2 pounds, It can be regarded as a &quot;baby meal&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xinjiang&#39;s largest &quot;Aimai&quot; naan has a diameter of 40 to 50 centimeters. It requires 1 kilogram of flour to make. There are patterns stamped in the middle of the naan, and there are chopped onions or sesame seeds. . Nang with meat in a vat, pitted meat with naan, Xinjiang fried rice noodles with naan... Thousands of ways to eat naan, brewing the nostalgic memory of Xinjiang people when they were children waiting for their mother to break off a piece by the naan pit and feed it to their mouths. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why Xinjiang cuisine is so heavy is that Xinjiang people don’t have the concept of kilograms and liangs. What they call “one kilogram” is actually one kilogram. Because of the &quot;bigness&quot; of Xinjiang, they created their own weights and measures - there are 22 airports in one province of Xinjiang. In their eyes, distances within 1,000 kilometers are very close, and 1,000 kilometers is enough to travel from Beijing to Taiyuan and back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to the large portions, the prices of Xinjiang dishes are also shocking in Northeast China, which is always known for its affordable prices. According to data from Dianping, the top ten restaurants in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, only cost 74 yuan per person, which is lower than the average price in the capitals of the three eastern provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is large in area and heavy in weight, and the &quot;imagination&quot; of Xinjiang people is also very big. Many Xinjiang people&#39;s store names reveal a kind of simple humor. A series of store names such as &quot;Sexy Mommy&#39;s Postpartum Recovery Mother and Baby Center&quot; and &quot;Drag and Drive Over&quot; make people laugh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As an inland province, Xinjiang gives people the impression that it has nothing to do with water. Also because of its &quot;large&quot; territory, Xinjiang has almost all the country&#39;s specialties, such as Salmon production accounts for 15% of inland production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xinjiang also has great charm. In the first three quarters of this year, Xinjiang received 213.86 million tourists, a year-on-year increase of 77.73%. Tourists rushed to this western land, came with expectations, and left reluctantly as if they were heartbroken. Xinjiang’s specialty paper-skinned walnuts and Hotan jujubes are also on sale on Taobao. Even if they stay at home, they want to taste the taste of Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, &quot;know&quot; will talk to you about the &quot;bigness&quot; of Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73461&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70268&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3fbf9d25ee.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom – 1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width =&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3fbf9d25ee.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258185&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73462&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70269&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/14/5dc309c9d1.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom – 2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/5dc309c9d1.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258186&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73463&quot; group-id= &quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70270&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/22777928eb.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom – 3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/22777928eb.png&quot; data- key=&quot;258187&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73464&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70271&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/b673748357.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom – 4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/b673748357.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258188&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img -id=&quot;73465&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70272&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3de07e6f6c.png&quot; img -title=&quot;custom – 5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/14/3de07e6f6c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258189&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73466&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70273&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/f437541a92.png&quot; img-title=&quot;custom –6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width =&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/f437541a92.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258190&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“永恒”的敌人：未了案横跨八十年，谁的“王洛宾”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260885]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 11, 2023, Zhuozhou, Hebei, Wang Haicheng&#39;s &quot;In That Faraway Land&quot; &quot;Place&quot; manuscript.

It was a cool evening in early September, and the new version of the red children&#39;s drama &quot;The Ballad of Soybean&quot; began its national tour here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some Chinese people are familiar with this story. In 1940, the Gansu Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Party of China was destroyed. Luo Lili, who was 8 months old, was arrested at the same time as his parents. After several twists and turns, he was imprisoned in Lanzhou Dashagou Prison, where he spent 6 years. Wang Luobin, who was also in prison, asked Luo Lili what the most delicious food in the world was. Luo Lili, who had never been exposed to the outside world, thought it was broad beans that he had eaten by chance. Wang Luobin composed the song &quot;Soybean Ballad&quot; from this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A while after leaving the venue, the crowd suddenly surrounded an old man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The old man has appeared on CCTV 13 times. On TV, he is smart, wise, and tall. He is proud that he &quot;didn&#39;t make a single mistake&quot; when talking. &quot;, and sometimes, I even have to play and sing &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; on the stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But the old man in front of him has droopy eye bags and a lot of white hair on his sparse head. He kept taking out performance tickets from the small shoulder bag on his chest, a total of 40 tickets, which belonged to &quot;old friends&quot; he had met through cooperation in the name of his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of these &quot;old friends&quot; reached the peak of their careers in the 1990s. They had their own programs in top media and were able to open solo concerts in the most central concert hall in Beijing. Concert, organize a commemorative concert for Wang Luobin in the most famous building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also officials from Zhuozhou, Hebei. This county-level city with a population of 650,000 has a 30-square-meter former residence of Wang Luobin and a Wang Luobin Chorus. The director of Zhuozhou Culture and Tourism Bureau and the director of the cultural center drove 60 kilometers to come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He is the youngest son of Wang Luobin, the &quot;King of Western Singers&quot;. Wang Luobin&#39;s ancestral home is in Zhuozhou, and a new Wang Luobin Music Memorial Hall is about to be renovated in an old factory in the north of the city as a local cultural landmark. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin, who will appear on the stage in a quarter of an hour, is a &quot;prisoner&quot; who has to go through several political movements before he can be called the King of Singers in the future. , Prison Years, and Social Change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin&#39;s 83-year ups and downs often give playwrights a headache. He once participated in the Northwest Anti-Japanese War Theater Troupe with Xiao Jun, Seke and others. He was also highly appreciated by the warlord Ma Bufang and formed a children&#39;s theater troupe in Qinghai. During China&#39;s darkest period, he captured a hint of romanticism, and some of the songs he was most proud of in his life were born here, including &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; and &quot;Youth Dance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At half past seven, &quot;Soybean Ballad&quot; started. I got a chance to film Wang Haicheng, a documentary director who has been following him for more than ten years. The film is called &quot;Looking for Wang Luobin&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the &quot;old friends&quot; in the audience, some people want to promote this drama to a bigger stage, and some people want to make a movie related to Wang Luobin. , two people respectively proposed to build a music school named after the king of singers in Hebei and Hainan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They all need to obtain authorization from Wang Haicheng. Only a few people realize that everything the son of the King of Songs enjoys at the moment is facing unprecedented challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 11, 2023, in Zhuozhou, Hebei, Wang Haicheng showed his published biography of Wang Luobin and audio and video products.

Among the three sons, the eldest went to Australia in the 1980s. The second child was a truck driver and died of illness. After surviving a period of history, the four fathers and sons now only have the third child left. Therefore, interviews, authorizations, rights protection, concerts, commemorations, and publications all fell on Wang Haicheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, for a long time, the identity of &quot;Wang Luobin&#39;s son&quot; made Wang Haicheng breathless. When he was 8 months old, Wang Luobin was arrested, followed by a search of his home. A month later, his mother passed away in the hospital bed. Relatives in Beijing did not dare to have contact with the Wang family. After hearing about it, the fifth uncle in Zhuozhou drove a carriage all day and night from Beijing in the early winter in the north to bring the body back from Beijing and bury it in a wheat field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A few years ago, Wang Haicheng tried to find his mother&#39;s tomb, but he could no longer find it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Studying stopped in the second grade of junior high school. When it was time to go to the mountains and countryside, Wang Haicheng stayed on the farm for nine years because of Wang Luobin. When groups of educated young people returned to the city one after another, he also got a nickname: &quot;Cushionzi&quot;. This dialect refers to the last puppy out of a litter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Family is never a place where the singer is willing to devote his attention. Wang Haicheng wrote that the union between his father and his mother was due to the breakup of his father&#39;s previous relationship, so he wanted to take revenge on his life. Wang Luobin was born free. He went to the grassland, to the market, and even in prison, collecting folk songs. A producer who visited the singer&#39;s deeds mentioned a detail. In his later years, Wang Luobin rode a bicycle everywhere. When it got dark, he would lie on the road and fall asleep, and then go home the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin passed away in 1996. Wang Haicheng immediately joined the China Music Copyright Association and registered 207 musical works recorded, organized and created by Wang Luobin with the association. He became increasingly aware that his father had left a shining legacy. Since 2000, Wang Haicheng has successively published two biographies of Wang Luobin, a song sheet of Wang Luobin, invested in TV films, and a long narrative poem. Four exhibition halls have been created in Turpan, Xinjiang, Haibei, Qinghai, Baishui Ancient Town, Dabancheng, Xinjiang, and Liupan Mountain, Ningxia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is difficult to say how father&#39;s love plays a subtle role in Wang Haicheng&#39;s life. In order to guard this heritage, he was like an ascetic, stationed in the Grape Valley of the Flame Mountain for 16 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the first few years of the 21st century, the Turpan Wang Luobin Music and Art Museum in Grape Valley was the only temple to commemorate the king of singers. This building has an Ottoman-style white circular dome and 80 panels displaying the singer&#39;s life. Visitors came in the 40℃ high temperature. When they opened the door, they saw the sweaty son of the singer wearing a shirt with Wang Luobin&#39;s logo in front of him. There were biographies, song collections, tapes and records on the counter. When the operation of the art museum was most difficult, Wang Haicheng went to bring in strange stones from the Gobi Desert that looked like pork belly and English letters. This is the most popular commodity in Xinjiang’s tourism market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also set up an incense burner in front of his father&#39;s portrait - Wang Luobin converted to Buddhism in his later years. There was once a man who claimed to be a physicist and kowtowed three times directly to the portrait. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Haicheng honed his speaking skills, pondered the details of his father&#39;s life, paid attention to his image, and never refused any opportunity to appear in the national media.

Ethnic minorities hold weekly house music gatherings. Seven days and nights after the song &quot;Forgetting Love Water&quot; reached Urumqi, the shops in the Grand Bazaar would use rough-sounding speakers to play versions in other languages. The bars all over the street are full of singing bands. On the radio, the male host can talk endlessly about the Beatles, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yibo, the director of &quot;Looking for Wang Luobin&quot;, was the popular host of the Urumqi Economic Radio program &quot;Music Leisure Island&quot; at the time. After more than 20 years, she believes that Urumqi at that time showed tolerance for all kinds of music and was the &quot;center of Asian music.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there is no local singer&#39;s name in popular music. His limelight comes from outside Urumqi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin was rediscovered in the context of an era where order was brought to order. In May 1981, on an afternoon when the temperature suddenly soared to 33°C and the snow suddenly melted, in a five- to six-square-meter concierge at the Qianjin Theater, Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Quanzhang met Wang Luobin, who had just been released from prison. In Zhao Quanzhang&#39;s reminiscence article, this person who looked like Quasimodo in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; was unemployed, had no household registration, and did not even have &quot;food and oil connections.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Quanzhang wrote the internal reference for Wang Luobin, and soon received instructions from Song Renqiong, then head of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Zhao Quanzhang once recalled that the work of bringing order to the country was not completely smooth at that time. The resolution of Wang Luobin&#39;s problem had an impact on Xinjiang and the whole country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Openness was the theme of the 1980s. And for a musician who has experienced the war of resistance, prison, and rehabilitation, is there any symbol more suitable to glimpse a country&#39;s path of exploration? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the autumn of 1988, &quot;Eight Thousand Miles to the Clouds and the Moon&quot; hosted by Taiwanese artist Ling Feng went to Xinjiang to interview Wang Luobin. This was the first program from the other side to introduce China. TV programs about mainland China’s customs and customs. Then, Xia Jie, a female writer from Hong Kong, China, also came to visit and wrote three articles. Soon, Singapore, Australia, North America, and overseas Chinese had someone to pay attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The media calls him the King of Western Singers and enjoys special government subsidies. China Record Corporation awarded him the Golden Record Special Creation Award, and UNESCO awarded him the &quot;Promote &quot;Special Contribution Award for Cultural Exchange between East and West&quot;. But all medals are inferior to the gifts given by the people. In the era when the word &quot;fan&quot; only refers to fans, Wang Luobin&#39;s most proud example is, &quot;Chinese friends said that at least half of the two million Chinese in the United States can sing. &quot;In that distant place&quot;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A more well-known story is that Sanmao, a female writer from Taiwan, China, moved directly into the home of the singer, and scandals abounded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Trouble is coming quietly. One day in 1993, Luo Dayou&#39;s agent called. Not long ago, Rolling Stone Records released the tape &quot;Love Song Anniversary - Luo Dayou and Wang Luobin&#39;s Great Collaboration of the Century&quot; without Wang Luobin&#39;s consent. The King of Songs was very angry and took Luo Dayou to court for infringement of his copyright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Greater controversy ensued. Someone revealed that Ling Feng paid 20,000 yuan to buy out ten of Wang Luobin&#39;s songs, including &quot;In That Faraway Place&quot;, &quot;The Girl from Dabancheng&quot;, &quot;Mayila&quot; and &quot;Youth Dance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The music issue soon turned into a political issue. Someone asked, can Wang Luobin sell folk songs that belong to the people? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A major discussion that lasted for more than a year began. In June 1994, &quot;People&#39;s Music&quot; magazine began to discuss the copyright issue of Wang Luobin&#39;s folk songs. Dai Penghai, an associate researcher at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, published two articles criticizing the news media for hyping up Wang Luobin, and also accused Wang Luobin of &quot;selling out the people&#39;s sovereignty and interests in national music culture.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also people who support Wang Luobin. Liu Zaisheng, a professor at the Music Department of Shandong Normal University, pointed out that “collecting brotherly ethnic songs in different languages ​​is a more complex and difficult task, and the translation and dubbing of lyrics often plays a key role in success or failure.” And “if we combine the When the lyrics are analyzed together, it is not difficult to find that they have formed Wang Luobin&#39;s unique creative style that is lyrical, colloquial, and popular.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another background to the great discussion is that during China&#39;s &quot;resumption of customs&quot; negotiations, the Copyright Law was promulgated in 1991, which stipulates that &quot;adaptation, translation, The copyright of works resulting from the annotation and arrangement of existing works shall be enjoyed by the person who adapted, translated, annotated and arranged them.&quot; In other words, if Wang Luobin &quot;adapts, translates, annotates, and organizes&quot; folk songs, the copyright of the new songs belongs to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But, does changing one note, two notes, or a chorus count as &quot;adaptation&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 5 of that year, a symposium attended by more than thirty people was held in Beijing, including musicologists, composers, and legal professionals. people and journalists. The person presiding over the meeting was Qiao Jianzhong, then director of the Music Research Institute of the China Academy of Arts. He later recalled in an article that this symposium was actually an &quot;absent criticism&quot; against Wang Luobin, which was very explosive. However, the meeting finally reached a consensus that Wang Luobin had worked hard in recording, translating, editing, and adapting folk songs, but the rights he enjoyed needed to be quantitatively analyzed before the rights could be determined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The eighty-year-old singer was very hurt and left the stage to participate in the debate in person several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the death of Wang Luobin in 1996, the big discussion did not continue. But this discussion could have clarified some fundamental issues, such as the quantitative standards for adaptation and the copyright of folk songs. In that era, Wang Luobin was not the only one who encountered similar problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Shanghai, a young man who was writing &quot;The Complete Works of Xian Xinghai&quot; was also troubled by this problem. In the process of sorting out Xian Xinghai&#39;s works, Wu Yuebei, a top student in the composition department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, checked and filled in the original scores. Some melodies that he thought were not harmonious even needed to be changed. When Xian Xinghai&#39;s descendants heard about Wang Luobin&#39;s dispute, they worriedly asked, if the original score was adjusted, would the copyright belong to him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After consulting the leaders of the Ministry of Culture at the time, &quot;The Complete Works of Xian Xinghai&quot; was finally processed as follows: the works with major changes were also included in the revised original works. version, as well as a more substantial adapted version. For revised or revised editions, the name of the reviser will be marked as a footnote at the end of the work, but no copyright will be generated. The edited version will have a copyright page marked with the name of the organizer, who owns the rights to the content compiled by him in the new version, but not the rights to the original work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This young man majoring in composition has no way of knowing that after more than 20 years, he may end the discussion about the copyright of the singer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wang Luobin and Luo Dayou.

Wang Haicheng suddenly discovered that everything his father left behind could be easily taken away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, China was in the midst of a heat wave to achieve modernization through a market economy. The &quot;resumption of customs&quot; turned into &quot;joining the WTO&quot;, a stable and international The integrated legal system is gradually improving. Intellectual property rights are a focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2002, Wang Luobin&#39;s adaptation of &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; was sued by the family of a deceased musician for copyright infringement. The family members believe that &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; is not a folk song, but a song composed by the late musician, originally titled &quot;How Beautiful My Garden is.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The family did not sue Wang Haicheng directly, but first sued an audio-visual company in Guangzhou. The CD published by the company labeled &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; as a folk song. The court found that the song was composed by the late musician. Afterwards, the family took this judgment and sued Wang Haicheng, claiming 230,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Haicheng said that &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; was written by his father in 1969 while serving a sentence. At that time, a young man was unjustly imprisoned, and his new wife died. The young man stopped cutting his hair and shaving. Wang Luobin felt inspired and adapted &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; based on an Ili folk song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A friend in Yili told Wang Haicheng that the original version of this ancient folk song can be found in the local archives. But before he was about to leave, the friend said that the information was missing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2004, the court of first instance sentenced Wang Haicheng to pay compensation of 237,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the appeal, Wang Haicheng and his lawyer began to think about how to collect evidence. In October 2005, he and his lawyer pretended to be collectors from Beijing and spent 4,600 yuan to buy a small video camera. After arriving in Yili, they arranged to grab mutton and invited local music teachers and old people who could sing folk songs for interviews. At first, they did not reveal their interest in &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; and started talking about Ili folk songs. The cameras are always working. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the conversation was almost over, Wang Haicheng turned to &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; and asked if there was an original folk song version of this song. Everyone said yes, and everyone hummed a line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But when they reveal their identities, very few people are willing to testify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After hitting a wall one after another, they finally found three old people willing to testify. I also met an &quot;Avanti&quot; (meaning &quot;teacher&quot;) named Ishamuddin, who said that the original song had probably been circulated for two hundred years, and he also knew that a lawsuit was ongoing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, Wang Haicheng thought that if he lost the lawsuit, &quot;things would develop like dominoes.&quot; Dozens of publishers had published this song Society will also be in crisis. Even if he travels to Hainan, he will pray with Mazu, hoping that Mazu can help him, the son of the king of singers, who is in trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On May 8, 2006, the Xinjiang High Court made a judgment that the two songs each enjoyed property rights in copyright. In Wang Haicheng&#39;s words, &quot;Both songs come from folk songs, and they are in a parallel relationship.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At almost the same time, Wang Haicheng launched a blanket rights protection campaign that lasted for several years. For the sake of copyright, he fought against pirated CDs, KTV bosses, and singers who randomly covered his father&#39;s works. His opponents include audio-visual city vendors, publishers, university professors, as well as Li Yuchun, Tan Weiwei and Wang Sulong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was in 2004 when he was ordered to pay 237,000 yuan in compensation that Wang Haicheng received an unfamiliar phone call. The other party introduced himself like this: Ju Yonghe, a native of Jiangsu, a lawyer in Beijing, and a loyal fan of Wang Luobin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When they finally met a year later, Wang Haicheng was deeply impressed by his &quot;uprightness and non-joking&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;He said that he was concerned that there were many publications infringing Wang Luobin&#39;s rights on the market, and he especially wanted to help protect his rights.&quot; Wang Haicheng was &quot;a little nervous financially at the time, and he was also weighing Should I file a lawsuit?&quot; Lawyer Ju dispelled his concerns: He would bear the cost of the lawsuit. If he lost the lawsuit, he would not ask Wang Haicheng for money. If he won, he would pay half of it after deducting travel expenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This may be a more subtle way, and it also uses legal weapons to confirm again and again that Wang Luobin owns the copyright to a certain song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2005, Lawyer Ju has continued to make efforts. He went to the audio and video market and Xinhua Bookstore, walked around, saw the allegedly infringing publications, bought them, issued invoices, and sued. &quot;All those audio and video publishers came to me to ask for authorization. They can also use high-definition pictures of Wang Luobin on the covers of their publications. I also provided the introduction of Wang Luobin on the inside pages. It is more accurate and the text is smoother.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wang Luobin became an invasive iconic icon. Around 2010, lawyers turned to KTV, and in the words of the time, it was &quot;sweeping&quot;. KTV&#39;s infringement made Wang Haicheng even more intolerable. The picture with &quot;in that distant place&quot; is Hainan beach and bikini beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Based on the Yangtze River Delta, the lawyer has stepped up step by step. In his eyes, &quot;the judicial environment of the Yangtze River Delta was relatively good at the time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The victory is as big as the snowball. To some people in the music industry, even if they did not belong to him before, they now belong to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; According to Wang Haicheng, this round of economic income is not as much as people imagine. &quot;. But he was very happy, and felt that the battle was broken, &quot;hitting those pirated KTV quietly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He gave himself an indestructible significance: maintaining his father&#39;s eternal and immortal status in the history of Chinese music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But this blanket-type rights defended abruptly in 2013, and Wang Haicheng was put on a hug. After mediation of the Supreme Law, Wang Luobin&#39;s descendants reached an agreement: Some previous lawsuits were withdrawn, &quot;those who could not withdraw the lawsuit should take the initiative to notify the acceptance authority to add Wang Haiyan (big brother) and Wang Haixing (second brother) as the joint litigant. The lawsuit shall be made by the three people (Wang Haiyan, Wang Haixing, Wang Haicheng). &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Lawyer appeared again, waiting for 6 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;September 10, 2023, Wang Haicheng came to an old factory in Lazhou, Hebei, where the Wang Luobin Music Memorial is planning.

The girl of Sakura City was born in 1938, and Alamu Khan did not appear until May 1944. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; One reason is that Wang Luobin does not sign much. He edited a &quot;Northwest Singing&quot; related to the Anti -Japanese War, and the background was printed with &quot;the Gansu people&#39;s anti -enemy aid will be compiled.&quot; Wang Luobin said in his own manuscript, &quot;I think this job is the obligation of a citizen.&quot; In special years, many of his songs were not signed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wang Hai has become a father&#39;s creation of three biography. Among them, it is the creative story of pursuing his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But for the first time he heard his father about his creative motivation, it was 1974. One day, the father and son came to the friend&#39;s house to celebrate the full moon for the children. With the wine blended by alcohol, everyone coaxed and let Wang Haicheng sing. He took the guitar, sang a &quot;Man Li&quot;, and talked about the source of the song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;There was a pair of lovers on the Mongolian grassland. During the Anti-Japanese War, the man signed up for the army to fight. The woman heard that the man was sacrificed in the rear. I came back after the man&#39;s fight. When I heard that the fiancee died, she ran to the cemetery and sang the song in front of her tomb. Suddenly, the woman stood out from behind the grave again. &quot;Wang Haicheng recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wang Luobin, who is no longer loves speaking, sulk a bite: &quot;It&#39;s interesting today, my son sang Lao Tzu&#39;s song, but I don’t know that this song is Lao Tzu. Write. &quot;It was a yellow song, criticizing it in the 1950s, reaching its peak in the 1950s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; More stories are collected during the period when they temporarily live in the second brother&#39;s family. Father and son slept with a small room with two beds on the left and right, and a window in the middle. During the day, Wang Luobin lifted the bed and copied the bedboard as a table. In the evening, the mosquito couldn&#39;t sleep. On such a night of the 1970s, Wang Haicheng asked the silent father again and again: I heard that there is a song for you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But this experience will not be helpful until 30 years later, Wang Haicheng&#39;s biography of his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After the death of the father, the difficulty of finding songs became more difficult. Sometimes song problems were legal issues, and sometimes even political issues. Only the origin of a song does not require Wang Haicheng to find, that is, &quot;In the Far Far&quot;, the &quot;Pearl on the Crown&quot; of the Western Song King. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 1939, Wang Luobin followed the director Zheng Junli to the Qinghai to shoot the movie &quot;Long Live Nation&quot;. Do a helper. When catching the sheep, Wang Luobin accidentally pumped a whip on the horse&#39;s buttocks, Zhuima on the horse shook the whip and gently hit Wang Luobin&#39;s body. So, there was the plot in the lyrics: &quot;I would like to make a lamb/I followed her/I would like to hit me with a leather whip every day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The king himself told the media too many times. But maybe it is too much, so that one day in the future, some people who are interested start to compare the time, place and characters of each story, and find that it is difficult to fulfill the flaws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wang Luobin also told the actor Ma Yue. In his early years, the actor won the second prize of the Blogo Singing Fa in the Qing Ge Charity. After holding a personal concert at the Beijing Opera House, after singing &quot;In the Far Far&quot;, a goat Hu Hu found him and said, &quot;Ma Yue, you look like when you are young.&quot; Second The saying is, &quot;You sing my singing accurately.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; That was a big discussion in 1994. The King of Song pointed out his two errors, one of which was the wrong tune. &quot;I am in prison, you sing my song outside. Now I sing back the song back, everyone said that I sang the wrong, I I can&#39;t change it anymore. &quot;Many people don&#39;t know, the&quot; In the Far Far &quot;, which is widely sung, is indeed not a version of Wang Luobin. His version, the score is now engraved on his tombstone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After the two met twice, the song king added the process of spreading this song. He said, &quot;There are a lot of people who sung in the front of the front line. Why?

In the list, the national first -class composer Gong Yaonian, Hu Tingjiang, deputy director of the composition department of the Chinese Conservatory of Music, and the People&#39;s Music Publishing House were listed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The issues of arguments are mainly concentrated. Is the song presented in the publications of these composers copy or adapted from Wang Luobin&#39;s version. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; For example, the reason why Gong Yaonian was sued was that he had previously compiled a batch of folk song piano songs from circulating folk songs, named &quot;Somson&#39;s folk songs&quot; &quot;Gong Yaonian &quot;Arrangement&quot;. This has aroused the dissatisfaction of Wang Haicheng. In his opinion, the nine capitals including &quot;The Far Far&quot; belong to Wang Luobin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;A inappropriate metaphor proposed by the other party is the relationship between grandpa and grandson. &quot;Li Yan, deputy director of the editor -in -chief of the People&#39;s Music Publishing House, said,&quot; But in the words of the other party in court, &#39;Wang Luobin is grandfather, all of you are grandson&#39;. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text -rign: left; &quot;>; The defendants also questioned accordingly, thinking that some of Wang Luobin&#39;s songs did not go through&quot; adaptation &quot;at all, or even&quot; copied &quot;the creation of others directly. The family of one of the defendants also found that the authenticity of the creative stories written by Wang Haicheng and the creative story of the King of Songs is yet to be questionable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The defendant&#39;s family is Wu Yuebei, who participated in the &quot;Complete Works of Xinghai&quot; more than 20 years ago. He is now a professor at the School of Music and a doctoral tutor in the composition direction. The defendant Gong Yaonian was his father -in -law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The second round of rights are turbulent. At the beginning, the defendants each fought. Hu Tingjiang, the earliest prosecution, adapted a &quot;Marrayam&quot;. In just this song, the lawyer of the residence sued him nearly a hundred times in many courts across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Hu Tingjiang recalled that he had been prosecuted, and there were still many puzzles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Around 2017, Wang Haicheng suddenly added Hu Tingjiang WeChat to inform him of the adaptation of &quot;May&quot; from Wang Luobin&#39;s &quot;May&quot;, and he needs to get his own. Authorization. Hu Tingjiang replied to respect Mr. Wang Luobin, but &quot;Marra&quot; was not created by Wang Luobin, but a well -known Kazakh folk song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Once, Wang Haicheng sent a message and praised Hu Tingjiang&#39;s adaptation very successful. He hoped that he would continue to work hard and adapt a few more Wang Luobin&#39;s works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In June 2017, Wang Haicheng sent another solo concert list of Changji College, which was printed with the words &quot;Young Dance&quot; Hu Tingjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It didn&#39;t take long for him to be prosecuted. The subpoena was sent from all over the country, and Hu Tingjiang remembered that the courier in the community was sent to the court courier every day, and he was very puzzled, &quot;What did this family commit?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Until a trial live broadcast, Hu Tingjiang, who was fighting alone, learned that Gong Yaonian was also prosecuted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Soon, these prosecution professors, musicians, and publishers formed an alliance of interoperability information. There are 43 people in the &quot;Wang Luobin Copywriter Case, and there are more than a dozen publishing houses in the&quot; Music Publishing Unite &quot;. Different from those KTV and audiovisual companies that have been sued by the son of the king of the song, the people in the &quot;alliance&quot; uphold such beliefs: even if they are only claimed with 10,000 yuan, they must make the reason clearly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On the afternoon of April 20, 2023, 29 years after the discussion was launched, another symposium was held at the People&#39;s Music Publishing House called &quot;National Folk Music Work Protection -Wang Luobin&#39;s descendants of the Western Folk Song Copyright Dispute Case &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On this day, Li Yan once doubted that some publishers far away from Shanghai and Hunan would send representatives to this meeting with only half a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On that day, she was surprised to find that more than thirty publishing houses, many of them were present in person. At the meeting, some people admitted that they did hesitate to the court&#39;s subpoena before: (Wang Haicheng) It costs 10,000 yuan a song to bargain with him, and 5,000 can be reconciled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Someone later proposed that it was not money. Finally, everyone formed a consistent opinion, okay, let&#39;s go to the end.&quot; Li Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Another consensus reached by the conference is that &quot;the legislative level should be introduced as soon as possible&quot; to &quot;realize the law can be rely on, avoid the same case in the judicial practice, &quot;Different judgment&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In fact, the original provisions of the copyright law introduced in 1991 that &quot;the copyright protection measures of folk literature and art works are separately stipulated by the State Council.&quot; But there is no following. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The most active Hu Tingjiang, northern Wu Yue, etc., turned the libraries of the Central Conservatory of Music, the Chinese Academy of Music and the China Institute of Music, and even Also find original information from the Moscow Library of Kazakhstan and the Moscow Library in Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After more than three years of searching and research, Wu Yue north now believes that he can complete the tasks that the teachers have not completed many years ago and put Wang Luobin down the altar . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At the end of September 2023, I met Wu Yue in a community near Wanshou Park, Beijing. He has a majestic national face, and he has a tired elegance when he walks. Beside a piano, he prepared a chair and a laptop for me, which contained evidence he collected. Earlier, he had to bring two things, a Bluetooth speaker, and a luggage full of physical evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This composer made me stare at the computer screen carefully.

Earlier, the authorities planned to cancel the subsidies of the student&#39;s consumption of coal and were opposed by the students. After the &quot;Coal Incident&quot;, students began to seek autonomy in a school in the subtropical canyon. At the same time, they couldn&#39;t wait to find some deeper things from the soil of folk songs from the soil of folk songs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At that time, the situation was unknown, but this group of music students began to worry more eternal issues. In the first series of &quot;Chinese Folk Songs&quot; they printed, there is such a wish: &quot;After analyzing these folk songs, the problems that have not been paid attention to in Western composition can be produced. . &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; There was no way to pick the style at the time. According to a memories article by Xie Gongcheng, the first series of&quot; Chinese Folk Song &quot;was from&quot; New Music &quot; Magazine, Yan&#39;an&#39;s small singing book, Wang Luobin&#39;s &quot;Northwest Folk Song Collection&quot; and private relationships, more than a hundred national songs collected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This &quot;Northwest Folk Song Collection&quot; was published in Chongqing in 1942. At the end of 1939, Wang Luobin gave the manuscript to the reporter Zhang Xiluo, a reporter from Chongqing in Xining to publish it, and Zhang Xiluo found the opportunity until he opened the Dagong Bookstore. The collection of the Capital Library shows that the song collection contains 17 songs, and there is no &quot;in the distant place&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; During the collection of &quot;Chinese Folk Songs&quot;, the students of the piano group were responsible for the accompaniment, and the vocal group was responsible for the singing. There are two teachers joining, namely the professor of the composer and the director of the teaching affairs, Chen Tianhe, and the professor and director of the composition department, Jiang Dingxian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; History has a bifurcation here. Although Volkswagen regards Wang Luobin as the benchmark of the western folk songs, the college faction has also paid attention to Wang Luobin, but in the music education of professional colleges, the history of the folk song system has begun to start with the &quot;folk song movement&quot; of the Shan Song Club. When it comes to &quot;Alamu Khan&quot;, they will think of Xie Gongcheng&#39;s four chorus adapted in 1945; when it comes to &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot;, he will think of Jiang Dingxian; and when it comes to the &quot;Pearl on the Crown&quot; of the Song King, The person they think of is Chen Tianhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; There is only one reason. The accompaniment of this song popular version is equipped with Chen Tianhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wu Yuebei looks for clues from Wang Luobin&#39;s own words. &quot;People&#39;s Music&quot; magazine published an article &quot;History is fair&quot; written by Wang Luobin in 1994, which mentioned that &quot;in the distant place&quot; can allow his colleagues, a lady named Ug Huiying to testify as a testimony. &quot;It can not only prove that this song was written by me, but also proved that this song should have copyright.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Ugly Huiying at the time was the chairman of the Taipei Music Copyright Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wu Yuebei found the &quot;Northwest Folk Song Collection&quot; compiled by Ugly Huiying in 1967. A total of 88 songs, 84 of which are edited by Ugly Huiying, and &quot;in the distant place&quot; is marked as Chen Tianhe arranged. Interestingly, the version of Chen Tianhe is currently a small version, and it is engraved with the tombstone of Wang Luobin, which is a big version. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 1994, Ugly Huiying presented a &quot;Selection of the Chinese National Ballad&quot; by her in 1982 by her in 1982. Nothing was marked with her name. As for &quot;In the Far&quot;, only &quot;Qinghai Folk Songs&quot; are written. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; These two versions seem to contradict each other. From the north of Wu Yue, two key issues are explained. First of all, there is no version of Wang Luobin published by Ug Huiying. Secondly, according to the analysis of Wu Yuebei, the reason why the second version has the names of ugly Huiying and Chen Tianhe, it is that the version of the &quot;removed &#39;part&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This is actually an old topic in the 1990s discussion. What exactly is the difference between &quot;adaptation, sorting&quot; and &quot;notes&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the north of Wu Yue, the arrangement is on the basis of the original work. It simplifies the complicated works by increasing or decreased and deleted. The work, plus his own play, becomes a readable vernacular work. The adaptation must be incremental, for example, a folk song is changed to a symphony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; And, folk songs have its particularity. The folk song is a song created by the public. The words and songs have been continuously polished and deformed by countless people. According to different times and place, different versions will be generated. Wu Yuebei also gives an example, &quot;You change the&quot; In front of the bed, the moonlight &quot;to the&quot; In front of the window, the moonlight &quot;, are you going to replace Li Bai?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He found a &quot;Selection of Chinese People&#39;s Songs&quot; published by Shan Ge Society in 1946, which selected a small version of &quot;In the Far Far&quot;, which stated that &quot;Chen Tianhe is accompanied by accompaniment&quot;. According to the survey of Wu Yue, a female student in Qinghai sang to Chen Tianhe in 1945, and the latter spent the piano song for this. Wang Luobin&#39;s version was officially published in 1983 &quot;Selection of Luobin Songs&quot;. Wang Luobin knew that the existence of a small version was also attached to the book, but he explained that this was the result of the female student who went to school in Chongqing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In some circulating statements, the female student was Ugly Huiying, who graduated from Chongqing National Music Institute in 1947. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The memoir called &quot;Walking through the Memory Star&quot; also inadvertently mentioned Ugly Huiying and Wang Luobin. This book was written by Luo Wenzhi, the vice president of the former Ningxia Huangpu Military Academy Association, and wrote his son Luo Jiyuan in 2010. It is mentioned that in August 1993, Luo Wenzhi met with Tang Ying Ugly Huiying in Beijing. During the chat, Ug Huiying said that in 1993, Wang Luobin reunited with her in Taipei, and learned that she had spread her &quot;The Far Far&quot;, &quot;Youth Dance&quot; and &quot;Daban City Girl in Dazya City&quot; in Qinghai for many years. Folk songs are very emotional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Pearl on the crown&quot;. According to Liang Maochun, a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music, in 1940, a musical named &quot;Flower of the Desert&quot; was staged in Xining. The &quot;New Music&quot; magazine published in November 1942 reported the matter. The &quot;Songlin&quot; magazine published in December of the following year records the complete script and music of the play. In the preface of &quot;The Song of Desert&quot;, Wang Luobin mentioned that the episodes used in the play are all Kazakh people&#39;s songs, with new words. &quot;I Want to Be a Shepherd&quot;, which is the predecessor of &quot;The Far Far&quot;, appeared in the first act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; History meets the narrow road here, but as the parties leave the world one by one, some statements have been difficult to verify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 2023, the opinion of the lawyer is that the signature on any or several &quot;earliest publications&quot; cannot prove that the signature is 80 80 Author of a certain song a year ago. He also made an example: &quot;A watch on a person&#39;s wrist, and life experience tells us that the person wearing a watch is the owner of the watch, and the person who does not need to wear a watch provides any other evidence to prove it. And their descendants have claimed their rights, exercise their rights, and defend their rights for songs such as &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot;, &quot;Four Seasons&quot;, &quot;Mayera&quot;. No one else has proposed rights proposal in the past 40 years. Anti-evidence. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; north of Wu Yue, why did the students of the music department that year become the main force of the altar of the king of La Ge more than 20 years later? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The reason is that his understanding of Wang Luobin has begun since the 1980s. In the 1990s, many friends and teachers, including Dai Penghai and Xie Gong, had participated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; One more important reason may be that Wu Yuebei is responsible for a national folk song inheritance project. Wang Haicheng&#39;s prosecution will make him unusual difficult. Do you want to include folk songs related to Wang Luobin? Will there be legal risks after inclusion? What should I do if similar people come out? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Not long ago, some editors asked Li Yan and wanted to use western folk songs to deal with it? &quot;I suggest him that the case has not been finalized yet, so you don&#39;t need it.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;IMG Alt = &quot;The 1947&quot; Chinese Song Selected &quot;by Hu Tingjiang, of which&quot; Kangding Love Song &quot;signed&quot; Jiang Dingxian &quot;(Jiang Dingxian&quot;.

They all found that society pays attention to new series of lawsuits. Not high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Until today, there are still Wang Luobin&#39;s memorials in Pakistan, Hubei, Baishui Ancient Town, and Urumqi. Member of the CPPCC also hopes that all children in Puzhou will sing Wang Luobin&#39;s song. In early September 2023, at a lecture at the Three Gorges University, Wu Yuebei mentioned this protracted copyright dispute, but the audience at the scene did not know who Wang Luobin was except the teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Today, the person who knows the western song king most lives in a 26-storey commercial house in the north of Lazhou. This is a residence purchased after Wang Haicheng was moved by the enthusiasm of Lizhou officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Most of the time, Wang Haicheng is a long-awaited and strictly restricted old man. Once, he took me to the old factory in Puzhou to check the construction progress of the Wang Luobin Music Art Museum. He indirectly reached a call, and the other party wanted to buy Wang Luobin&#39;s manuscript. He was full of &quot;good&quot;, hung up the phone, and made a look at me. &quot;I asked others to know that Wang Luobin&#39;s son sells manuscripts, which is incredible.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He is easy to be excited, especially when it comes to these difficult and from the academic opponent, he will doubt the motivation of the opponent and admire their cunning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is difficult to confirm whether Wang Haicheng understands these complaints from the professional music circle. In this commercial house, he continued to move out of his published Wang Luobin&#39;s work and several thick Xinjiang folk songs, and repeatedly emphasized that the change of a note and a word is the result of his father&#39;s exhaustion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Uyghur is a multi-syllable, Chinese is a single syllable, and the Han people say that good is &#39;good&#39;, Uyghur said that a good one is&quot; To sing the Chinese folk songs in Chinese, it must be a big surgery for it. &quot;Wang Haicheng can also give more examples. For example,&quot; Alamu Khan &quot;is adapted to the Children&#39;s Troupe of Qinghai, so it has been added for half a rest, which is convenient for convenience Children breathe when singing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The 72-year-old man still needs to answer the &quot;love&quot; between his father and Sanmao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;I have seen it, eating at my house, my wife gave Sanmao noodles, eaten two meals, and told me to talk to me when I have come, I have been here for several days.

He also explained that the photo was actually placed on the cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Now, some stories are invalid. The Tianjin High Court determined that the &quot;Mayera&quot; adapted from Hu Tingjiang was not infringed; during the trial of Hu Tingjiang&#39;s version of &quot;Youth Dance&quot; case, the Hubei High Court directly stated in a 34 -page judgment: If Wang Haicheng and others have the demands of rights, then then It is tantamount to &quot;belonging to the right of primitive folk songs.&quot; The Hubei High Court also ordered a series of &quot;risks&quot; after litigation: Once supported rights protection, Wang Haicheng and others can be based on Wang Luobin&#39;s first work, and arbitrarily initiate lawsuits in other homologous works in the subsequent subsequent. This is undoubtedly &quot;harmful to the right to the original folk song.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Another reason is that the world left by his father, Wang Haicheng spent half a lifetime and continued to construct. Those who accused Wang Luobin of no copyright may disappear all this smoke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He is the child who has won Wang Luobin from the three brothers. So far, he will play the piano every day and play with the guitar. If anyone says he and Wang Luobin are very Like, he will show a sincere smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wang Luobin did have a dream to let his songs sing for 500 years. So far, the longest Chinese songs are said to be &quot;Jasmine&quot;, which has been circulating for nearly 400 years. In 1794, I finally met the Macanloni Mission of the Emperor Qianlong, ready to return to Britain from Guangzhou. Here, the group secretary John Baro heard the Guangzhou dialect version of &quot;Jasmine&quot;. He was in &quot;China Travel&quot; The song was recorded with Roman Pinyin and translated lyrics, becoming the earliest record in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; So, who is pushing the eternal universe of the western song king and let it slide into the abyss of forgotten? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Perhaps, all this has nothing to do with the law. All cultural idols will disappear in time. At first, it was their fall, and then the fans were old.

He talked: &quot;Wang Luobin&#39;s songs dare not touch, and we (units) have also defended.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left ; &quot;>; In the summer of 1982, Du Yaxiong was still a young man. He lived in Wang Luobin&#39;s house to help him organize the score. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Recalling the summer of forty years ago, Du Yaxiong has a feeling of vagueness. Wang Luobin did not understand the origin of his song. &quot;After all, he is not engaged in us. This major (ethnic music), we know whether a song belongs to a folk song or a song, which is very clear. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; National music began in 1959. Dutch musicians, who have been dispatched by Java for 15 years, renamed the 3rd edition of his book &quot;Music&quot; to &quot;National Music Science&quot;, which created this discipline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Wang Luobin told Du Yaxiong that the song &quot;Dadal and Maria&quot; was sang by a Kazakh old lady in Xining, Qinghai around 1940. Including &quot;Maura&quot;, Wang Luobin believes that these are folk songs, but Du Yaxiong does not agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“对哈萨克民歌有研究的人，可以看出来这些不是民歌。为什么？哈萨克民歌有特定格律，一首歌分主歌和副歌两部分，主歌歌词一定是11个音节，它们的组合可以是344、443、434。每个组合就是一个音步。”杜亚雄说，“还有个规律，那就是词曲结合不吻合，一般的歌词、曲都是吻合的，而哈萨克民歌一个乐句已经结束了，但词还没有唱完，要把第一句词的最后一个音步放到第二个乐句里唱；或者用第一乐句的最后一个乐节唱第二句歌词的第一个音步。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;杜亚雄推测，这种音乐呈现方式，很可能来自哈萨克族的日常Life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“游牧民族有一个互换机制。年轻人不会一直待在帐篷里，要去放羊，如果你要去一个哈萨克族的帐篷做客，骑着马，在离帐篷200米的地方，先&#39;啊呺——&#39;地喊一声，帐篷里有人，他就会出来把狗拴好，也用&#39;啊呺——&#39;回应你。”这位研究音乐演变历史的学者顽皮地补充道，“但我分析的这个也不一定对。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如果不是民歌，又是什么？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;杜亚雄懂哈萨克语，经过多方打听，他终于找到了《都达尔和玛丽亚》以及《玛依拉》的作者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;第一首歌的作者名叫玛利亚·贾格尔（1887—1950），出生于哈萨克斯坦阿克莫拉市，是哈萨克斯坦人民艺术家。杜亚雄推断，她在1903年前后创作了这首歌。这首歌在哈萨克斯坦流传很广，曾作为很多音乐作品的主题。从王洛宾记录的时间来看，最迟在1930年代初，这首歌传入中国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;第二首歌的作者名叫玛依拉·沙姆苏特蒂诺娃（1890—1927），阿拉木图音乐学院教授阿合麦提·朱巴诺夫曾在《时代的夜莺》一书中介绍过此人，并说这首歌是作者的“自画像”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;杜亚雄也考证了《达坂城的姑娘》，他曾专门到吐鲁番寻找这首歌的原始版本，发现当地的版本有弱起和切分节奏。他好奇王洛宾的版本为何不是这样，王洛宾的说法是，他听到的司机就是这样唱的——并非王海成所说，是主动改成适合汉族人唱的版本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;关于《青春舞曲》，王洛宾这样告诉杜亚雄：“是1939年在酒泉东关记录的，歌词是原有的，不是我编的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;至于“皇冠上的明珠”，杜亚雄并不认为流行的版本是“走调”的结果，而是一个版本为男腔，采用“反调”的手法，创出一个女腔。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;因此，在1983年的《洛宾歌曲选》中，杜亚雄把歌曲分为两部分，第一部分是民歌，第二部分是王洛宾的创作，而这几首，都在第一部分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但是，杜亚雄也肯定了王洛宾翻译少数民族语言的贡献，“即便我自己能写少数民族语言的歌，但也很难把歌词翻译成中文，太难了，翻译讲求信雅达。当然，有的东西已经和原本的不太对了，他算是半编半译了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;事实上，在北京知识产权法院的终审判决中，王海成仍然取得部分胜利。法院认定，王洛宾及其后人继续享有《达坂城姑娘》《都达尔与玛丽亚》《玛依拉》《在那遥远的地方》的词曲著作权；对于《青春舞曲》，享有歌词著作权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但王海成仍然认定，有人在加速这场消逝。不久前，北京师范大学在制作音乐剧《往事歌谣》时，有人提出《在那遥远的地方》可能有争议。学校转达，是一位律师举报的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;律师名叫董晓月，是陈田鹤的外孙女。她同样拥有一个执着的人生。上高中举办合唱比赛时，有同学提到《在那遥远的地方》属于王洛宾，她会去挠人家。陈田鹤在1955年已过世。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;80后的董晓月做过记者、图书编辑，但这件事时不时揪着她。 2010年前后，她开始在北京各大图书馆寻找山歌社的《中国民歌选》，这本书最早的版本全中国只有两册，她最终在中国艺术研究院音乐研究所的内部图书馆找到了. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;就像是一段人生经历的结果，董晓月成了一名律师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有人曾让她也去收取版权费，她在一封信里答复：“不应再纠缠于版权之争，让一切随风吧。音乐的问题，不用交给法律。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;八十多年前的青年王洛宾不会想到，一首歌的版权和来历，在遥远的未来会变得如此重要。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1935年，22岁的他在北京西直门外的一所中学做音乐教师。附近有一条河，夏天中午，他就跑到河里游泳，同游的还有不少东北沦陷后迁移来的大学生。一天，光着屁股、一身泥的众人在听同学念《八月的乡村》，这本小说描写的是“九一八”事变后，东北军民同日本侵略者奋战的故事。当念到一首名叫《我要恋爱，我也要祖国的自由》的诗时，满怀激情的王洛宾穿起衣服，把诗抄下来，回家谱曲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来，一位青年找来，说他歌写得好，唱得也好，但知不知道小说作者是谁。王洛宾窘了，回答不知道。青年大笑，说，“作者是萧军，我就是萧军”。王洛宾回忆道：“我大吃一惊，于是我们两人拥抱，开怀大笑，就这样做了朋友了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（南方周末实习生黄晓颖对本文亦有贡献）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;据媒体报道，现在有不少家长带着孩子在横店当“童漂”，寻找出演影视剧的机会。 The life of &quot;Tong Diao&quot; is also very bitter. &quot;100 people grab a seat&quot;, &quot;Earn 250 yuan in 4 months&quot; and &quot;paying a lot of money with the capital&quot; are the norm of many &quot;children&#39;s drifts&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有媒体统计，2022年在横店拍摄的电影、网剧、电视剧等影视文化作品中，230部有未成年演艺人员参演，人数达6000多人。这个数字并不小，也是“童漂”之所以存在的原因——横店确实提供了演戏、出名的机会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，随着各路怀抱梦想的儿童及其家庭的涌入，“童漂”迅速变得内卷。 It is difficult for the &quot;Tongfu&quot; industry to say that it is a pure dream chasing story, but has evolved into a strange capital game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2万1年，1年内最少能保证上3个戏，可以出演特约演员等。5万3年，3年内最少保证8个戏，能够上特约演员及角色等”，这是媒体报道里横店几家儿童经纪公司的收费模式，根据缴纳数额分为各种等级的“会员”，然后配备相应资源。 Obviously, for families who lack an economic foundation, &quot;Tong Diao&quot; is very cruel and the return rate is extremely low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而“童漂”的另一个问题在于，追梦的主体是孩子，他们如果处在一种漂泊不定的状况，那么教育怎么办？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义务教育法规定，适龄儿童、少年的父母或者其他法定监护人应当依法保证其按时入学接受并完成义务教育。如果父母为了一个童星梦，让孩子早早地离开了学校，已经涉嫌违法了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而孩子即便是左支右绌地完成了义务教育，但基础教育过于薄弱，这种影响也可能是终身性的，“童漂”的成本未免太过巨大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，对于“童漂”的风险，家长应当有更多理性、全面的评估。 “成腕儿成角儿”，终究有着巨大的不确定性，家庭赌上一切去拼一个概率极低的机会，这是否明智？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而且儿童还不具备完全民事行为能力，他们对自身行为的性质其实还没有完整清晰的认知。很多孩子确实喜欢演戏，但他们对“沉没成本”是缺乏认知的——一旦演艺道路受阻，孩子该如何回归常规的成长路径？孩子对此茫然无知，而家长如果也缺乏审慎，无疑是一种不负责任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，舆论也没必要对“童漂”及其家庭做陈义过高的批判。 Some common criticisms on the Internet, such as &quot;taking children as a tool for making money&quot; and &quot;Parents have a dream of getting rich&quot;, are not accurate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从采访中可以看到，很多家长不过是因为孩子想演戏，想奋力一搏帮孩子圆梦罢了。 They may not be a parent who wants to smoke, which is essentially no different from asking children to &quot;read famous schools&quot;. They all chose a road with a very internal curler and unclear prospects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在规劝家长保持审慎的同时，社会也应当有所干预。比如那些演艺经纪公司是否正规，其实就应当引发相关部门的关注。有家长反映，“带资进组”疑似遭遇诈骗，交了钱不仅无戏可演还被当事人“拉黑”了。对于这些，市场监管部门应当顺着相关线索，去排查其中有无违法违规问题存在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一根不容模糊的红线是：无论家庭给孩子选择怎样的成长路径，但受教育必须得到强制性的贯彻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论如何，横店“童漂”的辛酸，终究是一种令人难言滋味的内卷。追梦之旅当然是充满艰辛的，但这条道路似乎又不那么符合一种朴素的儿童成长叙事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鉴于此，“童漂”是否适合自身的家庭状况，还是需要家长再三地审慎考虑；而社会显然也应当努力扫除其中存在的风险隐患，保障未成年人权利，至少让“童漂”这条路上少一些坑。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 12:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[假如我变成了“熊孩子”丨世界儿童日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260935]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[涉罪的“豆芽”：网售体彩242亿元被控非法经营]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260927]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2022年8月3日，呼和浩特，乘客在中国体育彩票“幸运专列”主题列车上留影。（人民视觉/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d59a5b48fe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d59a5b48fe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258819&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2022年8月3日，呼和浩特，乘客在中国体育彩票“幸运专列”主题列车上留影。 （人民视觉/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“线上平台不能用了？”2023年11月15日，浙江省长兴县某体育彩票店店主吴勇的微信里又弹出熟客的询问。 He can receive similar information almost every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;吴勇在县内经营5家体彩店，曾是国家体育总局体彩管理中心评选出的全国优秀竞彩网点业主。 But now, he is planning to transfer the three stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年2月16日，因涉嫌非法经营罪，吴勇被江西省吉水县公安局拘留，“退赃”120万元后被取保候审。吉水县检察院认定，2019年至2023年，吴勇通过“豆芽”App销售体彩1.27亿元，非法获利810万余元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“豆芽”App的运营模式是，彩民线上下单，店主收到通知后，在线下彩票实体店出票。 APP operators are profitable by charging a 1%handling fee from the owner of the store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;根据起诉书，在“豆芽”注册的彩票代销店近1.4万家，彩民271万余人。 From 2019 to 2023, the total number of lottery tickets sold through &quot;Douzhao&quot; was approximately 24.2 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;从时间上看，吴勇等人被指控的行为主要发生在2015年国家对网售彩票清理整顿之后，8年来，财政部没再开放对网售彩票的授权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在刑法中，构成非法经营罪的一个条件是违反“国家规定”。 However, the &quot;Lottery Management Regulations&quot; formulated by the State Council in 2009 did not stipulate the sales of lottery tickets through the Internet. The relevant regulations were formulated by the Ministry of Finance and other relevant ministries and commissions. During the trial of this case, the focus of the dispute between the two parties was that Wu Yong and others sold lottery tickets through the Internet violated the &quot;national regulations&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;“禁令”带来红利&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;吴勇的彩票店生意始于十年前。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2013年，巴西世界杯举办的前一年，身为球迷的吴勇在长兴县城商业区租下一个门面，经营的第一家体彩店开张。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;彼时，多家互联网头部公司都在各自平台开通了网络售彩业务，线下彩票店生意并不景气。按照吴勇的说法，线上售彩服务吸引了大量年轻人，世界杯开始前，自己彩票店的生意“基本只能回本”，客户大多是同他一块看球的熟人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;查阅相关公开信息，财政部未公开披露过互联网彩票市场的规模。一个可供参考的数据是，长期跟踪彩票市场的机构彩通咨询发布的《2014年互联网彩票市场分析报告》显示，那一年，中国互联网彩票销售规模达850亿，较2013年销售规模翻番，市场份额首次超过20%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不过，火热的互联网彩票市场很快被政策降温。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2015年1月15日，财政部、民政部和国家体育总局联合下发《关于开展擅自利用互联网销售彩票行为自查自纠工作有关问题的通知》。 2月底，阿里、腾讯、网易、新浪、人民网等多个互联网平台宣布停售彩票。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;既料到又没有料到的是，吴勇享受到了“禁令”带来的多重红利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;那些原本被互联网平台吸引的彩民开始光顾他的彩票店。不时还有人问他，线下购彩太麻烦，还有没有线上购彩的渠道？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;和同行交流时，吴勇知道了“87彩店”（“豆芽”前身）这个应用。他在网上找到公司电话，打过去询问。之后，公司销售人员同他联系，要求他提供店铺照片、代销证、银行卡、身份证等核验资质。通过审批后，吴勇的线上彩票业务开始了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;彩民通过吴勇分享的彩票店推广码下载App后，购买的彩票只能从吴勇的店铺出票。 2015年开始，线上销售额就能占吴勇店铺销售总量的近一半。此后暴发的新冠疫情，进一步加速了吴勇线上生意的发展，“通过App销售的彩票，差不多能占七八成。”他估算。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2021年是吴勇业绩最好的一年，线上彩票销售额达到四千多万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;足球赛事大多集中在晚上，彩民的购票热潮是在开赛前半个小时。一家线下体彩门店一般只有一台终端出票机，生意火爆时，出票速度跟不上。从2018年开始，吴勇又以店员或亲戚的身份陆续申请了4家体彩代销店，以消化更多订单。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;使用“豆芽”期间，吴勇就留意到有店主因为使用这款应用，被地方体彩管理中心通报，暂停门店销售权限。他的门店里，还贴着县里体彩中心下发的禁止网售彩票的宣传海报。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但他“没太当回事”。毕竟，靠实体店里零散的客人，甚至都难以回本，“要生存下去，不可能不用线上渠道”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者从接近案件的人士处了解到，目前至少有62位使用过“豆芽”的彩票店店主被吉水县公安局调查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;除两名店主已被检察机关诉至法院，南方周末记者同另6位涉案店主确认，他们在2023年2月至6月间陆续因涉嫌非法经营罪被吉水县公安局取保候审，目前仍处于公安机关侦查阶段。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这6人向南方周末记者表达了相似的想法，“大家都这么干，你不干不就亏了？”一位店主说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;波动的政策&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;和吴勇一同被检察院起诉的，还有另一名彩票店店主，以及“豆芽”的运营公司北京春新芽科技有限公司实际控制人王岭峰和6名员工。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;王岭峰在2014年年底入局互联网彩票业。按照他对南方周末记者的说法，自己是在华东某省体彩管理中心领导的建议下进入这个行业，此后也曾受多地体彩中心邀请给店主们做培训，“怎么用&#39;互联网+&#39;的思维卖彩票&#39;”。不过，南方周末记者未能向他所述体彩机构核实到这一点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2016年，王岭峰在接受《新浪彩通》采访时提到，2015年初禁售互联网彩票的政策出台前，公司已开始和多地体彩中心谈合作，中心认可他们的模式，并愿意推给店主。禁令下发后，洽谈全部停止。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;出乎他意料的是，很多彩票店主却主动找到公司，“当时真觉得都快完了，居然活了过来”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;那次采访中，王岭峰谈到，创业中面临的最大困难，“还是政策”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;互联网彩票制度经历了从收紧到放宽再到收紧的过程。在中国境内，合法彩票只有国务院特许发行的体育彩票和福利彩票。民政部、国家体育总局分别负责全国福彩、体彩的管理，财政部则负责彩票的监督管理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2007年12月，财政部、民政部、国家体育总局联合下发《关于彩票机构利用互联网销售彩票有关问题的通知》，提到要一律停止利用互联网销售彩票。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但到了2010年，财政部又发布《互联网销售彩票管理暂行办法》（以下简称“暂行办法”），指出要抓紧选择具备暂行办法规定条件、管理基础好的单位，报财政部批准后开展试点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;暂行办法中还强调，未经批准，任何单位不得利用互联网销售彩票。不过，这份文件仍被业内解读为一个积极信号，意味着此前处于灰色地带的网售彩票模式有望合法化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在无一机构获财政部批准的情况下，互联网彩票业迅速发展。新浪、网易等门户网站和淘宝、京东、当当等电子商务平台都推出了彩票业务。彩通咨询统计，2011年，中国互联网彩票销量突破百亿元大关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2012年9月，网售彩票试点落地。财政部同意国家体育总局体彩管理中心委托中国竞彩网和500彩票网开展网售体彩业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;到了2015年，政策又逐渐收紧，相关部门发布了前述针对网售彩票的禁令。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2016年4月28日，财政部、公安部、原国家工商总局、民政部、国家体育总局联合发文，指出自2015年以来对网售彩票清理整顿取得阶段性成效，但个别地区还是存在有令不行、有禁不止的现象。文件再次强调，严禁彩票发行销售机构及其代销者擅自网售彩票。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不过，央视在2018年4月发布的调查显示，仍有超过三百多家彩票网站在运行，每年售彩金额不低于1000 billion.当年俄罗斯世界杯开赛期间，多个彩票App出现在手机应用商城的下载排行榜前列。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;4个月后，2018年8月21日，财政部、民政部、国家体育总局联合国家发改委、工信部、公安部等12个部委发布公告，坚决禁止擅自网售彩票行为，并指出财政部尚未批准任何彩票机构开通这项业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;13天后，财政部、民政部、国家体育总局又发布关于修改《彩票管理条例实施细则》的决定，“擅自利用互联网销售的福利彩票、体育彩票”被列入“非法彩票”之列。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年9月3日，北京服贸会体育服务展区的体彩展。（人民视觉/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/774ebd3c4a.jpg&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月3日，北京服贸会体育服务展区的体彩展。 （人民视觉/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;“国家规定”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2015年政策收紧后，财政部便没再开放对互联网销售彩票的授权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;目前，财政部、民政部、国家体育总局只能监管到各省市彩票发行中心和代销者。中国彩票行业沙龙创始人苏国京认为，如果允许网上销售彩票，非彩票机构的网络平台一旦出现“吃票”和各类争议问题，如何监管、谁去监管就成了大问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;所谓“吃票”，即彩民在网上购买了彩票，平台或代销者并没有实际出单，而是直接私吞票款。如果彩民中了小奖，可以直接兑付，要是彩民中了大奖，平台或代销者无法支付这笔费用，就可能出现关站、跑路的状况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;《检察日报》报道过“吃票”案例，上海一彩票店店主孙某在2019年2月至4月间利用互联网销售彩票508万元，实际出票443万元，吃票六十多万元。 2020年，上海青浦区法院以非法经营罪判处孙某有期徒刑6年6个月，并处罚金人民币60万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在“豆芽”上，每隔几个月，吴勇会被客服要求抽查实际出票情况。客服随机抽选10个订单，吴勇需要把对应实体票找出，拍照发给客服审核。吴勇表示，对彩民的线上下单，自己全部都在线下真实出票。起诉书也未提及他存在“吃票”行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不过，平台上还是会出现“漏网之鱼”。和吴勇一同被吉水县检察院起诉的一名湖南体彩店店主就被控“吃票”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;根据起诉书，2019年1月至2021年年底期间，他利用“云彩店”App（亦为“豆芽”前身）销售彩票1.48亿元，“吃票”金额6400万余元，非法获利327万余元。该店主在接受南方周末采访时表示，自己的确存在“吃票”行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;与“吃票”者不同，吴勇等彩票店店主通过App销售彩票，但在线下出票，是否也涉嫌非法经营？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2022年1月，江西修水县法院对一个类似案件作出判决（以下称“修水案”）。南方周末记者从该案一名被告人的辩护律师处获悉，此案中，售彩App与彩票店店主都不存在截留票款不出票、“吃票”的情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;修水县法院最终认定，售彩App相关负责人和App合作的数名彩票店店主均构成非法经营罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;法院判决的依据为，《彩票管理条例实施细则》规定，擅自利用互联网销售的彩票属于非法彩票的范畴。此外，App还设置具有赌博性质的跟单、合买程序等，改变了彩票销售、兑奖规则，“销售数额特别巨大，情节特别严重，扰乱了彩票市场秩序”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;刑法第225条对非法经营罪的定义是，违反国家规定，未经许可经营法律、法规规定的专营专卖物品或其他扰乱市场秩序的非法经营行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;被告人提起上诉后，二审法院维持原判。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;修水案律师告诉南方周末记者，开庭过程中，控辩交锋的一个重点在于，什么是“国家规定”？以及未经批准禁止网售彩票的相关文件，是否属于“国家规定”？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年10月9日、10日，王岭峰、吴勇等9人涉嫌非法经营一案在江西吉水县法院一审开庭，上述问题也是庭审in focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;刑法第96 条对“违反国家规定”的解释是，违反全国人民代表大会及其常务委员会制定的法律和决定，国务院制定的行政法规、规定的行政措施、发布的决定和命令。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;吴勇的辩护律师、对外经贸大学副教授郑海平在法庭上指出，《彩票管理条例》由国务院制定，属于“国家规定”的范畴。但该《条例》只是禁止“擅自发行、销售彩票”，并未明确禁止利用互联网销售彩票的行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;对于利用互联网销售彩票的禁止性规定，主要出现在《彩票管理条例实施细则》及《互联网彩票管理暂行办法》中。但前者由财政部、民政部、国家体育总局制定，后者则是由财政部发布。从法律位阶上来说，它们只是部门规章，不得认定为“违反国家规定”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;目前，吉水县法院尚未作出一审判决。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;分配格局可能被打破&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“豆芽案”中尚未被起诉的另6名店主也在等待判决结果。他们分别在福建、山东、江苏等地开设线下彩票店，均称没有“吃票”，在缴纳数十万到上百万不等的“非法所得”后，被取保候审。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;代理了修水县法院审理的非法经营案后，前述代理修水案的律师又陆续接到了近十件类似案件当事人的咨询，“八成以上都由江西省的公安机关立案侦查”。这意味着，使用网络方式销售的彩票店店主都面临着刑事犯罪风险。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;尽管有风险，但通过线上渠道销售彩票的店并不少见。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年11月13日，南方周末记者随机拨打北京10家体彩门店电话，以彩民身份询问是否可以线上购买彩票。 8家彩票店表示可以添加微信后线上购买，其中两家发送了可以网购体彩的App下载链接。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;就监管部门的态度而言，对通过App购买彩票，与通过微信让店主代购彩票的定性也不同。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者从北京、浙江、湖南等地体彩管理中心处了解，App购买彩票被明确禁止，而通过添加店主微信的方式购彩是否违规，目前还没有明确的界定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;吴勇所在的浙江湖州市体彩中心认为，微信购彩属于网络购彩行为，“没有违法那么严重，但我们不提倡”。长沙市体彩中心则表示，如果有彩票店店主被查到通过微信渠道售彩，“可能会受到撤机的处罚”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;网售彩票为何迟迟难以松动？苏国京告诉南方周末记者，在中国，彩票更被强调公益性，而弱化其博彩属性。互联网平台提供了比线下购买更为便捷的销售渠道和支付手段，但有可能造成彩民的沉迷，也让管控未成年人购彩更为困难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;北京师范大学心理学院副教授、中国彩票事业研究中心原副主任陈海平则表示，互联网售彩还会带来的问题是，原有公益金分配格局被打破。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;彩票资金被分为奖金、发行费和公益金三部分。按照财政部规定，各省彩票公益金一半上缴中央财政，一半留在省级财政。而互联网销售彩票则打破了地域限制，互联网经济发达的省份，销售额会上涨，留在地方财政的公益金增多。以线下销售为主导的省份，也必然带来公益金减少。这容易造成各省之间彩票销售的不良竞争，不仅打破原有的公益金筹集和分配格局，形成新的贫富不均，而且会出现各种市场乱象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在苏国京看来，如果彩票行业不出台更高位阶的法律，“不把互联网销售中的责权利厘清，就没法彻底解决问题&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[去扬州看东坡：到心仪之地，施仁爱之方]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260929]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;平山堂里思忆多&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>;

There is a stone plaque embedded on the wall of its east side. A few red characters &quot;Huaidong First View&quot; are very eye -catching.一观。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过大明寺的天王殿，西侧有一个八角型门洞，穿过去就是平山堂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;平山堂正前方是一列木质花廊，栽于两侧的老紫藤盘旋缠绕，茂密的枝叶与盛放的藤花，洒落一地清凉。我突然想起“堂前垂柳”，就先退出花廊。周边植着腊梅、琼花、黄杨、紫薇等，玉兰的叶片繁茂润泽，树高达七八米，盛放时应该很华美。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前庭南侧的草地上有块乳白石头，上方写着绿色大字“欧公柳”，它果然在呢。下方是欧阳修的《朝中措》：“平山阑槛倚晴空，山色有无中。手种堂前垂柳，别来几度春风……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;仁宗嘉祐元年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1056年）&lt;/span>;，朋友刘敞将赴任扬州知州，欧阳修为之饯行，赠以此词。 It has been a few years since he has been transferred to Yangzhou, and he still loves Pingshan Hall, where he once wandered.词里隐含一丝时光易逝的惆怅，但声调旷达明朗，并无衰颓之气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四处张望，却不见柳树踪影，有点奇怪，继续搜寻。结果它就在石头旁边，低矮，年轻，倾斜得似要躺下，是一株柽柳。树叶短促倔强，毫无袅娜之态。想象中欧公手植的垂柳，应是纤柔细长的那一款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/5EZGfpAtygCizPHpjt6EyLPDL9oWXNb27K5sAAUz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;924&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/5EZGfpAtygCizPHpjt6EyLPDL9oWXNb27K5sAAUz.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258828&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;平山堂&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（卢向前/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;平山堂内十分拥挤，旅行团熙来攘往。 “平山堂”匾下方的楹联，将浩渺时空、无边风月，兼收并蓄，景物中还有知情识趣的雅士：“晓起凭栏，六代青山都到眼；晚来对酒，二分明月正当头。”匾额的东西两侧，高悬“坐花载月”“风流宛在”匾，后者为清末两江总督刘坤一所题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;平山堂东、西厢的橱窗里，放置了四库全书的《六一诗话》《欧阳文粹》《文忠集》等；四幅木质诗牌占据了半堵墙，录着苏辙等吟平山堂的诗。 Mei Yaochen&#39;s &quot;Thousands of Mountain Flying Crossing the River&quot;, Su Zhe&#39;s &quot;Halling on the Mountains on the Mountains in the Hall&quot; has a small weather. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;仁宗庆历八年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1048年）&lt;/span>;，欧阳修由滁州徙知扬州时，仍处于“庆历新政”失败后的政治低潮期。他关注民生，为政宽简而事不弛废，滁州、扬州的百姓感其德政，都为欧公建有生祠。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公务之余，欧公诗酒流连，在大明寺西南方构筑平山堂，既能呼朋唤侣，登高望远，也可独享清幽。他写给前任知州韩琦的信里，很是欢愉：“独平山堂占胜蜀冈，江南诸山，一目千里。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看欧阳修他们的描写，还以为平山堂所在的蜀冈雄伟高峻。 Standing outside the hall today, under the stone railings in the southern south of the Liu Liu, there is a happy and beautiful red leaves.试图再遥望远方，视线却被树木遮挡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来乘电梯登上大明寺70米高的栖灵塔，那才真是利于极目远眺。 Hirakawa Hiroshi, looking at it, did not see any mountain peaks. The thin West Lake under the feet is like a long -rolled landscape, and the water shore is curved and lingering, as if inlaid in a thick or light green tree at will, and a small number of pavilions are scattered. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;苏轼对欧公的感情，不同寻常。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欧阳修一向举贤好士，他隆重奖掖苏轼，更是天下尽知。当时流行的太学体文风追求迂曲深奥、艰涩怪僻，欧阳修等有心匡正。仁宗嘉祐二年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1057年）&lt;/span>;春，欧公作为礼部省试的主考官，将“词语甚朴，无所藻饰”的苏轼擢为“论”试的第二名。本届进士中名人辈出，嘉祐贡举被视为“千年科举第一榜”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些志在必得的知名考生落榜后，愤懑不满，有人恶作剧写下祭文投往欧公家。还有浮薄士子围堵欧阳修，在他的马前喧哗鼓噪，“群嘲而聚骂者，动满千百”，巡逻的士卒难以制止。不过从此以后，病态的文风渐渐被扭转了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欧阳修对三苏评价都高，苏轼丰美畅达的文字，更是令他拍案叫绝。给梅尧臣的信里，他乐滋滋地说：“读轼书，不觉汗出，快哉，快哉！老夫当避路，放他出一头地也。可喜，可喜！”这是文坛前辈发现优异后生的喜不自禁，更是天才对天才的惺惺相惜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欧公的提携之恩、期许之情，令东坡终身感念，他说自己“受知最深”。元丰七年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1084年）&lt;/span>;东坡由黄州赴汝州，十月经过扬州时，再次踏入平山Hall.他“每到平山忆醉翁”，这回也不例外。壁上墨迹依旧，恩师却已仙逝，距离最后一次见面已经十余年。东坡以一阕《西江月》深挚怀念欧公，也感慨光阴似箭、世事虚幻：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;em>;三过平山堂下，半生弹指声中&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;。 &lt;/em>;&lt;em>;十年不见老仙翁，壁上龙蛇飞动。 &lt;/em>;&lt;em>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;em>;欲吊文章太守，仍歌杨柳春风。休言万事转头空，未转头时&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;皆&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;梦。 &lt;/em>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欧、苏两位文忠公，两代文坛盟主，均以道德文章垂范天下。他俩的任期都短，却令扬州人怀想，也让平山堂充满磁力。来参拜的后人络绎不绝，留下诸多诗文，续写了一脉风流。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王士祯的《花草蒙拾》说：平山堂地势不高，环境普通，“然以欧、苏词，遂令地重。”楼台亭榭一旦沾染贤人君子的光泽，或被丽辞鸿篇加持，就备添神韵。即使廊柱檐角已被时光磨蚀，依然不朽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;平山堂几废几兴，现存建筑为同治年间重建，后来屡次大修。它让逸兴雅怀有所附丽，也凝集了一段动人的师生情谊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;半年能够做什么&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;待到东坡也以知州身份来到扬州，已是平山堂建成40多年后。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哲宗元祐七年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1092年）&lt;/span>;二月，东坡在颍州接到任命，移知扬州，他非常乐意。三月到任，在扬州不足半年，这么点时间很难有所作为吧，他却以善政令百姓感怀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;东坡爱花，栽花赏花赠花簪花叹花，跟花朵各种互动。他笔下的梅兰菊荷、牡丹、海棠、山茶、杜鹃，或秾丽或幽洁，或一枝独秀，或满树争妍。他也很能领略芍药的妩媚，题画诗《赵昌芍药》云：“扬州近日红千叶，自是风流时世妆。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;东坡到任后，却做了一个大煞风景的决定：停办万花会。他写信告诉好友王巩：万花会已成为扬州大害，停办“虽煞风景，免造业也。”其《以乐害民》一文说：扬州芍药为天下之冠，万花会用花十余万枝，既破坏各家花园，胥吏也借此扰民损民，扬州人非常不满，“予始至，问民疾苦，遂首罢之。”他认为万花会是“以一笑乐，为穷民之害”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北宋文人张邦基的《墨庄漫录》记载：万花会始于蔡京知扬州时，此后年年延续。停办花会，“人皆鼓舞欣悦”。张邦基点评道：苏公为政基本上都是这样，让百姓受惠，所以被他们称颂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从颍州赴任扬州途中，东坡目睹了百姓艰难求生、流离失所的惨状：沿途城邑都有许多流民，因无力偿付积欠&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（欠官府税赋）&lt;/span>;，不敢归乡。行至乡间，东坡经常屏去吏卒，走访村落。父老皆满面忧戚地哭诉：今年虽然夏麦成熟，但丰年催缴积欠更严苛，“胥徒在门，枷棒在身，则人户求死不得。”东坡也忍不住流泪。他两次上奏章：臣曾经知杭州、颍州，现在又到扬州，“亲见两浙、京西、淮南三路之民，皆为积欠所压”，日益困厄，流亡、死亡者过半。淮、浙积欠最多，又连年遭灾，吏卒在上级驱督下催收，对平民日日威逼鞭挞。百姓如何安生？朝廷的仁政又如何体现？东坡“昧死一言”，请求朝廷暂停一年催缴，“使久困之民，稍知一饱之乐”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;依苏轼所请，朝廷六月一日下诏，淮南东西路、两浙路的积欠暂停一年催理。他喜不自禁：“诏书宽积欠，父老颜色好。再拜贺吾君，获此不贪宝。颓然笑阮籍，醉几书谢表。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;东坡经过调研，对税务、仓法、漕运等也提出改良意见，兴利除弊。门生李廌的《师友谈记》等记载：以往官府准许纲运的船夫私载货物，用以补贴收入。他们往往视官船为家，随时修葺，行船速度也快。近年严禁私载，结果舟坏人贫，漕米等比从前损耗数倍，公私皆亏；有的船工因饥寒偷盗货物，拆卖车船。扬州、楚州、泗州等州，众多船工遭鞭笞、发配，还有的沦为乞丐盗贼。东坡上奏折建议恢复旧例，得到朝廷准许。弊端消除，公私皆受益，也无人因此受刑。李廌引用《左传》的话感慨：“仁人之言，其利博哉”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;平山堂之北的谷林堂是东坡所建，现存建筑为清末重建。它与平山堂之间，由红色梁柱的走廊连接。跟谷林堂东侧一墙之隔，即大明寺的大雄宝殿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;堂额“谷林堂”三字，集自东坡的法帖。楹联“深谷下窈窕；高林合扶疏”则来自他的诗《谷林堂》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谷林堂的整体感觉，比平山堂似乎少一丝隆重意味，从礼仪的角度看，合乎长幼之序。当然，布置得也很丰满，大堂与东、西厢的墙上，有欧阳修、梅尧臣、苏氏兄弟的画像与《嘉祐贡举图》《赤壁夜游图》等，书法则有东坡临颜真卿《争座位帖》与他的《获见帖》《一夜帖》等。橱窗里陈列着黄色封面的《宋刻东坡集》和四库全书的《东坡书传》等。墙上整齐排列“苏门四学士”的诗牌，其中晁补之的七律《招缙云守关彦远、教授曾彦和集平山堂》，写于他邀约曾彦和等在平山堂聚会时：“蜀冈势与蜀山通，龙虎盘挐上紫空……少师杨柳无遗迹”，从后一句看来，晁写诗时欧公柳已经不存。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;元祐七年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1092年）&lt;/span>;八月东坡得到诏命，担任兵部尚书兼南郊郊祀卤簿使。朝廷屡次催促，东坡九月抵京。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;晁补之是兵部侍郎杜纯的女婿，东坡履新，恰好是杜纯的顶头上司。考虑到岳父与老师以前不曾近距离相处，担心他俩不那么投缘，晁补之向东坡介绍了杜纯立身处世的风格，以及当官任职恩及万物的优点。后来岳父来信称，与东坡共事得还不错，不过觉得他“尚气好辩”。晁补之回了一封长信，详述苏公为人为政的高风亮节：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;补之于苏公为门下士，无所复赞。然刚洁寡欲，奉已至俭菲，而以身任官责，嫉邪爱物，知无不为，尤是不忽细务，其有所不得尽，视去官职如土芥。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;晁补之直言不讳地反驳岳父——并不觉得苏公有此毛病：“来书犹怪其尚气好辩，此非补之所能知。”还提醒岳父：人非圣贤，各有短长。他举西汉名臣汲黯与郑当时的例子：两人性情各异，有不同的光芒与瑕疵，但司马迁并称其贤能。所以“君子以同而异，若是可也。”晁补之认为，各位贤者在朝堂和睦，则地方的好尚也跟朝廷一致，那就没有什么事是做不成的。这位女婿跟岳父辩理，维护师尊，还真是较真。晁补之在苏门四学士中受知最早，他对苏公的敬慕，可见一斑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;走到谷林堂北侧的小园，这一角比较安静。一组假山，几株老桂，桂花横斜的枝丫掩映青瓦屋脊，高挑的枫杨、竹子在风中摇曳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/nDQX5lQW91ibVFGxj7x2nuGqLXrSXsTQnNm6K4di.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;谷林堂建成后，东坡也在堂边的树林里喝过茶吧？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;写诗差点又惹祸&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;与瘦西湖的喧嚣迥然不同，竹西公园人迹稀疏，一派清幽。它位于古运河畔，1989年在竹西寺遗址一带兴建。里面景致不错，似乎像扬州人自家的后花园，没有太多外人打扰，悄无声息地漂亮着。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雨后空气清凉湿润，成片的银杏、桂花、松、竹、红枫等，愈发明洁清新。茶花开得正旺，海桐繁密细碎的米白色花朵，沁出清淡的香味。浅山、草亭、石桥、盆景，以及几处故址旧迹，各有可观。竹西精舍的左侧，立着吴道子画像、李白题赞、颜真卿书写的三绝碑复制件。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;公园深处的水塘后方，有两道垂直分布的碑刻长廊，陈列着杜牧、王安石、秦观、姜夔等咏扬州的诗词。东坡诗碑《次韵苏伯固游蜀冈，送李孝博奉使岭表》，曾是竹西寺一宝。后来诗碑不存，王士祯到寺里仔细寻访，居然找到残碑。他拂拭蛛丝灰尘，“摩娑三叹，如与公晤言、酬唱于当日。”随后次韵写下《上方寺访东坡先生石刻诗》，“缅思峨嵋人，文采真神仙。”碑廊内陈列的是摹本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/YOFvVaMjeCCuq5k4a8sO9dhQhYxjiAmvK3CaYvJI.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;此生已觉都无事，今岁仍逢大有年。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;山寺归来闻好语，野花啼鸟亦欣然。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;元丰八年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1085年）&lt;/span>;春，东坡得到神宗遗诏，获准在常州居住。他从南都&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（今河南商丘）&lt;/span>;欣然南返，四月下旬抵达扬州。田园梦想实现了，心情不错。五月初一与友人同游竹西寺，受到款待，所见所闻皆愉悦，忍不住写诗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/n46RDz21F4KrmOO7hXbatDGdZ6DQnW2X928ovIio.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/n46RDz21F4KrmOO7hXbatDGdZ6DQnW2X928ovIio.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;竹西寺位于蜀岗之尾，冈势至此趋于平缓。相传蜀冈的地脉与蜀地相通，泉脉也跟蜀江相连，所以东坡将竹西寺的水称为乡味，他要把含有故乡味道的井水携往江南的新家。真是惬意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没想到，后来他差点再次以诗罹祸。元祐六年&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1091年）&lt;/span>;东坡任翰林学士、知制诰时，政敌为罗织罪名，居然翻检陈年旧事，说元丰八年三月神宗皇帝驾崩，苏轼写诗竟将此视为“好语”，乐不可支。东坡赶紧上奏札申辩，说自己三月上旬在南都哀悼先帝之后，返回常州。五月初去竹西寺，“见百姓父老十数人，相与道旁语笑。其间一人以两手加额云：&#39;见说好个少年官家&#39;。”臣喜闻百姓讴歌少年天子，出于至诚；加之请求归耕常州得到批准；路过淮、浙，又看见丰收在望，因此作诗，还题于寺庙墙壁上。假如我有任何不善之意，怎敢公然示人？而且那时离先帝仙逝已经两个月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总算有惊无险。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/2AJvSxYhhCzzu7cHQHHFiYe4YGT1ujJQenAXUU4h.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;

&lt;p>;竹西公园位于竹西路，周边还有以禅智、上方等命名的街道。出公园南门往东，走到十字路口，朝北拐入江都北路。路右侧那片小高层住宅叫中海世玺，感觉小区的品质不错。居民从自家阳台俯瞰公园的花圃芳径，想必赏心悦目。前行三四百米即禅智路，一条稍微窄点的支路。道路一侧为建筑工地，被米褐色墙面围护着，上面写着“扬州是我家，用心呵护它”等标语。沿着江都北路继续北行，下一个路口即上方寺路。车流较少，道路通畅，偶尔有三两个行人悠闲走过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;竹西寺又名禅智寺、上方寺，最早是隋炀帝行宫，后来成为名寺，接待过众多帝王、名臣、文豪，1853年毁于兵火。 From the palace garden of Emperor Xingle, the famous monk&#39;s famous brake, the victory of the poet, the park, community, and streets of the citizens&#39; pacing ... The soil in this corner, I do n’t know how much the fluttering and melting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由唐至清，吟咏竹西寺的诗词不计其数，文学史上的璀璨人物，好些在此留下履迹墨痕。风流欲绝，惹人遐想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;假如用胶片再现他们的身影，应是这般模样：杜牧在秋雨后踏着蝉声而来，周边青苔满阶，桂花飘萧；张祜游罢繁华的十里长街，前往竹西寺，伫立月明桥上，痴看美人游弋，叹一声要死就该死在扬州；东坡的动作特别多，进了寺院先饮鸡苏水，后喝莺粟汤，又借来藤床瓦枕，躺平了享受竹风清凉，临走还不忘汲一罐井水，再蘸墨在墙上题诗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的“影像”素材最丰满、活络。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[抢课大战后，年轻人在夜校找到了生活的盼头]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260905]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;倒计时归零后，系统崩掉了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了准备这场抢课大战，90后女生吉姆特地制作了一张表格，志愿按照优先级排列，分别是非洲鼓课、手碟课、银饰制作课和扎染工艺课. The plan couldn&#39;t keep up with the change. On August 11, the system collapsed as soon as it opened.她幸运抢到了一个非洲鼓课的名额，“跟抢演唱会门票一样，”她说，“要有信念感，我一定要抢到。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;500元，12节课，每节课一个半小时。 2023年秋天，一项颇具年代感的群众生活——夜校突然在社交平台上受到追捧。 According to data from Meituan and Public Comment, the search volume of &quot;Night School&quot; on the platform increased by 980%year -on -year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海市民夜校的“资深学员”任轶切身体会到此前从未有过的火热。 2018年前后，她偶然得知了市民夜校的存在，她的母亲原本想学手机摄影，去夜校报名才发现年龄限制在18-55岁之间，超过55岁的老年人有专门的“老年大学&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;任轶自此“入坑”，五年间，她把皮具班、钩针班、盘扣班挨个尝试了一遍。 She said that at that time, the citizens night school was not as hot as it is now, &quot;basically the point of open (open quota) can be grabbed.&quot; At that time, most of the night school courses were common projects such as calligraphy, painting, yoga, and vocal music.五年后，报名页面显得乱花迷眼，列表中不乏“宠物友好社交课程”“海派调饮茶”“十二月花神系列课程”等光看名字就能挑起兴趣的课程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;年轻人加入夜校的目的很轻松，一位女生向南方周末记者解释意图：“社交，认识更多志同道合的人，或者你只是想新学一门技能，或者随便去看看，能学就学，不学就算了。都可以。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;火热的形势之下，任轶遭遇抢课滑铁卢，但最终交上了好运。在随时有人退课的动态系统中，她捡漏了一门盘扣课。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;涌入夜校“学艺”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;任轶偏爱手作类课程，此前在夜校上过皮具课和钩针班。皮具班上，他们以一块完整的植鞣革作为起点，经历裁剪、打孔、走针后，学习缝制卡包、钥匙包或口金包。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年秋天的这节盘扣班，她手上拨弄的新对象，换成了盘扣——一种在传统服饰中固定衣襟的扣钮。课程在一个工作日的晚七点开始，历时一个半小时。她将长长的软扣条，盘成葫芦状、燕子状等各式各样的扣子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时间一晃而过。 “每次到最后可能还做不完，但是人家打扫卫生的阿姨都急得要下班了，就赶我们。”任轶自认在班上属于手比较笨的学员，“但是我就是乐此不疲”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/s0wHEYsHW8aVjkdSRXynltS6wqLVnaKeTXMte0wY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/s0wHEYsHW8aVjkdSRXynltS6wqLVnaKeTXMte0wY.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;卢尔煜说，茶艺课和花艺课显得“闲情逸致”，如果在外面花几千元去学，有点不太值当，不如拿这笔钱去学语言这样看上去更实用的知识。而夜校价格低廉，降低了她接触这类兴趣爱好的门槛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/03eGV06UVYLt2pKNdY7VIfLPfX5r98BOaa2tR8VL.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;她很喜欢茶艺课的氛围，十多个人，四五人一组。一帮人听老师讲茶的起源、红茶的冲泡方法。老师传授记住六类茶的口诀，“&#39;红绿灯（红茶、绿茶、黄茶）&#39;，再加&#39;黑白青&#39;”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/D62e0AYt7n8glJp50gV7sbZSWe51VFLHbahlhKQw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;夜校的茶艺课相比市面上的培训课程价格更低廉，老师资质经过了专门筛选，对年轻人来说方便可靠。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;茶艺课上，老师带来不同品牌的矿泉水或纯净水，倒在透明杯子里，让大家蒙眼品尝不同水泡茶时的口感。检测pH值的用具能测出“有些水是7.37，有些8.08，还有一些6.26”。卢尔煜观察，水的pH值通常对口感影响不大，而水的硬度和矿物质含量则会带来两极评价。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在任轶上过的手作课上，最后一堂课通常是成果汇报，大家把一学期的成果摆出来展示。 “整个教室的长桌上都摆满了大家各种各样的作品，如果今天有一个夜市，我们整个班都可以拉出来练摊”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/tEhLHAOeGTtWR5hfmDhLLEzSBguexVra0BZxRBac.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;手作课的各项成果。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;不是需要坚持的事&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“我报夜校无非出于几点考虑。第一，它很经济，同等质量、同等内容的课程，可能在市面上需要两三倍的价格。第二，它很有保障，风险比较低。它是上海市群众艺术馆办的项目，不像外面很多兴趣培训机构那样，受经济下行的影响就干不下去了，课程都没上完中间就跑路了，我的钱就打水漂了。”吉姆对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她正式工作还没几年，在机关单位里上班，职业要求她保持“严肃、严谨的形象”，无论职业形象，还是自身行为，都有一定标准。但在非洲鼓课上，她不必那么紧绷。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每天，吉姆骑自行车通勤，身后背着装有非洲鼓的背包，远看像背包客。实木的非洲鼓，重达五六斤。同事问她是不是准备出去玩，她从不解释，“我说我就是出去玩了”。下班后，她脱下职业装，换好便服，骑20分钟车到夜校，结束后再骑半小时车回家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教非洲鼓课的老师会多种乐器，比如尤克里里、中阮、吉他、键盘。 12节课程，前半程从基本的四分音符、八分音符学起，中间穿插节奏型的教学。如今课程过半，她正在为最新的作业头疼——老师要求大家自己编一首曲子。她观察，非洲鼓老师很注重培养她们的编曲能力，学成后能通过乐器传达生活感悟，而非仅仅照着谱子打出一段别人写的旋律。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“（非洲鼓）不是需要坚持的事，我没有觉得它很负担，是我上完班后放松的事。”吉姆说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;权衡了上课地点的远近、时间成本以及学习的迫切程度后，孙依然最终挑选了桥牌课。这是一种颇费脑力的棋牌类游戏，她一边听老师讲，一边在笔记本上记下牌型和规则。桥牌班的上课点离她家只有一站地铁。 “等于我去夜校就是早一站下地铁去上课，上完课再坐同一班地铁，一站到家”。同是夜校班的同学，有人住在浦东，下了班赶到离家更远的夜校上课，仅仅是因为感兴趣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙依然觉得，一周一次的夜校，不会给自己带来太大的压力，“真有其他更重要的事，也完全有其他的时间处理”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她平时从事数据分析工作，按她的说法，就是将信息整理、分析、输出为“任谁看都是这样的”事实。 “工作不是一个纯理性状态，桥牌有完整的规则，明显的逻辑，其实都可以算出来的，你可以完全做一个AI机器人，可以算概率，对方可能出什么牌。”孙依然说，“我的工作虽然听起来像整理分析，但不是纯理性的，有很多人为因素参与决定，工作中我会觉得有些受束缚，但是桥牌没有。”她说，桥牌能带给她的乐趣正在于此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一项多人参与的棋牌游戏，观察桥牌桌上玩家的不同风格也能带来乐趣。孙依然观察到，有人脑子灵光，上了牌场对各类牌型应对自如，但“胜负心很强”；有的人和她一样，对阵时需要不断翻看笔记，因此将牌局拉得很长；还有仅仅把对局当作一次游戏，倾向于让对手直接把牌说出来，大家一起想想怎么做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/7mHrDYb4en1fFAVYlAQsX7bt7b8LYpiqGJ9uoXbe.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;桥牌课笔记。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙依然形容上夜校之前的工作日晚上，无聊、消磨时间。 “吃晚饭、健身、看看综艺也就过去了。看综艺或电影是没有头的，有时间就可以一直看，永远看不完。但如果我有别的事，也不会因为少看了两小时综艺而难过。”孙依然说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;夜校有出勤率考核，超过三次缺勤，就会失去下一季夜校的报名资格。 Many interviewees said that the night school courses are now more than half, and most of them have persisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“现在年轻人的工作压力比以前大，需要更多的释放，找一些乐子。每个人找乐子的方式不一样。”孙依然说，“因为网络发达，大家更习惯于线上交流，线下的交流反而少了，多出来自己的时间变多了，所以大家可能就更想要出去玩，其中包括上夜校。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“每个礼拜都很有盼头”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;将上夜校纳入每周日程后，这些年轻人也感受到看似无用的业余生活给日常生活带来的改变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据MBTI人格测试的结果，卢尔煜是一个“I人”。在“解放天性”的越剧班，大家要站起来演唱，还要压腿、跑圈。班上的同学两两配对，一个唱花旦，一个唱小生。越剧班里都是女孩，年龄不拘，70后到90后都有。前几节课，她们学《天上掉下个林妹妹》，卢尔煜选择扮“可以内向”一些的花旦。 “贾宝玉有些眼神戏，他说天上掉下个林妹妹，要表现出&#39;哇，这么漂亮&#39;，看到花旦很吃惊的感觉。有的同学会表现出特别浮夸的表情，老师也会被逗笑，你在这个环境里面也会被感染到。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;放在过去，自认“宅女”的卢尔煜除了下楼扔垃圾，可以二十多天不出门。她说，“夜校其实相当于给自己强制一个出门时间，不要跟社会彻底脱节。因为不上班，又不去线下这些（社交活动），跟人群越来越远了，所以也是有点强制自己这三天出门的感觉。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和同学们一起拍击非洲鼓，给吉姆留下一次难忘的体验。打鼓时，由于不熟悉曲谱，担心赶不上节奏，往往节奏会越来越快，这时只要有一个人意识到问题，可以慢下来，就会有越来越多人发现节奏快了，齐心拉回正常的轨道，“可能整体的节奏就会被拉回来”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吉姆说，这和现在大家热衷谈论的“内卷”相反。 “内卷”有一个经典的具象比喻：在电影院里，前排有一个人站了起来，遮住后排的视线，于是越来越多人站起来，最终所有人只能站着看电影。而非洲鼓中的放慢步调则恰恰相反，“当时一瞬间发现还能这样，觉得很奇妙”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再次回到教室，孙依然觉得夜校的氛围比起大学或中学时代好很多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“高中以前基本上都是被逼着，只能学这些，不管你喜不喜欢。大学虽然是自己选的专业，但基本上每一堂课都有很大比例的人其实根本不想听。”她观察到，夜校的桥牌课堂里，很少有鸦雀无声的情形出现，老师的问题总能得到学生热情的回应。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，随着桥牌知识的深入，抱着学习新东西的心态来上课的孙依然，也感受到知识积累的压力。 “现在感觉到了一个临界点，做这件事情给我带来的快乐，和我为了把它做好要付出的努力差不多持平了。”她担心随着难度增加，桥牌也会变得有些压力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这个名额是比较难抢的，你报了名，付出了金钱和时间，你又不好好实践，你还不如不去。”孙依然说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;报了皮具班的王一衣偶尔也感到焦虑。有一次，因为出差，皮具课要落下一节。 “我就觉得落一节课，会不会比别人少学点什么？”老师反过来劝慰她，回来会帮她把这节课补上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，王一衣总体上还是觉得，“每个礼拜都很有盼头”。 “能让你脱离工作，找一个新的寄托，每天白天已经被工作所累，晚上如果有一个新的内容，可以调剂一下生活。就会让你生活的重心不是一直在工作上，可以分一点心思给其他的东西。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（除任轶、卢尔煜外，其余受访者皆为化名）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《进击的巨人》中巨人凝视的经典场景。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;《巨人》为什么火？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;评价《巨人》这部作品，一个首先要回答的问题就是：《巨人》为什么在全球范围内会有如此高的热度和讨论度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/ypYjeefyRY4CiYEcGnOjEDEECvEE7Ztn1J09SPeZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;342&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/ypYjeefyRY4CiYEcGnOjEDEECvEE7Ztn1J09SPeZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258821&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《进击的巨人》主角经典手势。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在日本，电视仍然是动画最主要的播出渠道。而绝大多数中文语境下的日本动画，是被归入深夜档节目的。 Their broadcast time is usually after midnight. Such a broadcast time arrangement shows that these animations have not considered producing as the public from the beginning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是因为，日本文化产品已经形成一个市场细分极其成熟的产业。 Each work in such a market is almost specialized in its main audience, as is the Japanese animation as a late -night TV show. 《巨人》第一季播出时的同期热门作品还有《我的青春恋爱物语果然有问题》《我的妹妹哪有这么可爱》《约会大作战》《变态王子与不笑猫》《打工吧! &quot;Master of the Devil&quot;, &quot;A scientific ultra -electromagnetic cannon S&quot;, etc. These animations are customized from the background setting, character characters, and the direction of the story.好，但也限制了这些作品在更广泛的大众层面传播。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相应地，日本动画的常规制作理念，也一直是低成本、小产出。 In the Japanese animation industry with DVD and Blu -ray discs for a long time, a animation can sell 10,000 discs, even if it is a best -selling work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《巨人》在日本动画中是一个“异类”。 《巨人》第一季共9卷的动画光碟平均销量为52067份，截至2016年8月，总销量为468603份。它也是2013年日本销量第一的电视动画。 In mainland China, iQiyi, which introduced copyrights exclusively, received a total of 320 million network playback volume at the end of the first quarter.在北美，该作品销售额高达20万份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一众日本动画作品中，《巨人》的制作水准，远远高出业界平均水平（无论画面、动作，还是配乐），这为《巨人》前几季的制作公司Wit Studio赢得了“霸权社”的绰号。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《巨人》动画的制作周期也与众不同——这样的大热作品，却没有趁热打铁紧接着做下去。 《巨人》第二季动画播出，距第一季长达四年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个漫长的停顿来自“霸权社”的决策，该公司认为《巨人》的成功主要是自己制作水平的功劳，并思忖，与其制作版权不属于自己的《巨人》动画，赚一些辛苦的打工钱，不如用类似《巨人》的制作资源，去制作自己的原创动画。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这部动画就是《甲铁城的卡巴内瑞》（以下简称《甲铁城》），Wit Studio为之倾注了相当多的资源。仅从剧情之外的动画质量来看，《甲铁城》比第一季的《巨人》更优秀。但《甲铁城》不管在口碑还是热度上，都远远没有达到Wit Studio的期望。短板出在《甲铁城》的故事上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wit Studio的这段“弯路”，恰恰提供了一个对照组，让我们能够通过控制变量法，清晰地看出《巨人》火爆的根本原因——其本身的故事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不同于日本业界普遍针对二次元爱好者的那些带有“媚宅”属性的故事，《巨人》属于极为少见的、真正按照大众流行作品的模式去创作的作品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/0IMa5Hcv5KLsY818h8abDian5L1jDBT82RpJW9Vp.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《进击的巨人》中人类与巨人交战。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大热的流行文化作品有一些很基本的共性，那就是在做好世界观展示、悬念营造、节奏把握、人物刻画等的基础上，用良好的制作水平去讲好一个故事。 《巨人》的漫画原作，直到最终结尾之前，都符合这一规律——好看的故事被人喜欢。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;如何评价《巨人》？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;既然《巨人》的热度主要源自漫画原作，对《巨人》的评价也应该以漫画原作为主。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于《巨人》漫画，当时读者有这么一个说法：《巨人》漫画最终话发布时，最为高兴的是《钢之炼金术师》的粉丝，因为新世纪月更少年漫天花板的地位保住了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看起来近乎段子，其实不失公允。在结尾之前，《巨人》漫画有望冲击2000年以来最强少年漫，但是最终因为结尾的处理问题，登顶失败。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“新世纪”“月更”“少年漫”这些限定词，并不是像现在体育比赛中越来越细分的统计数据那样，“只要加的限定词足够多，谁都有可能在某方面成为历史第一”。而是因为，在日本这样一个强调市场细分的地方，不同类型的日本漫画之间存在极大的差异性。不仅是青年漫、少年漫、少女漫有着各自完全不同的创作模式和理念。即使同为少年漫，因为发行频率和每一期篇幅的不同，月刊漫画和周刊漫画之间也几乎是两种完全不同的生态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另外一方面，试图将不同创作年代的作品简单粗暴地拉到一起“关公战秦琼”，也无法得出有价值的结论。高度商业化的日本漫画，在很大程度上是以读者的喜好为导向的。所以一部漫画的故事走向和表达的主题，很大程度上反映的是那个时期主流受众的接受程度，而不是单纯由作者决定的。而且，后创作出来的漫画，在桥段和情节的处理上更容易比之前的作品来得完善。抛开这些谈完成度和讲述水平，难免“厚今薄古”之嫌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就连衡量一部商业作品成功与否最重要的指标——热度和销量——也无法作为跨时代比较作品优劣的依据。现在的互联网环境，再加上制作方越来越饱和的营销，以及对日本之外的市场的不断开发，导致现在的作品普遍比过去有更高的热度和销量。比如，《鬼灭之刃剧场版无限列车篇》上映时，打破了《千与千寻》保持二十余年的日本电影票房纪录，如今高居日本电影历史票房榜首。但恐怕没有多少人会认为，《鬼灭之刃》的作品质量真的超过了《千与千寻》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，如何评价《巨人》在日本漫画史上到底是一部怎么样的作品？不妨转化一下思路，去思考这样一个问题：下一部像《巨人》这样具有极高话题度的日本漫画作品什么时候会出现，它又能否避免《巨人》烂尾的结局？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于现在和未来的日本漫画来说，《巨人》这样有着完整世界架构和社会组织描写的作品，是很少见的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;漫画作品中构建的世界，实际上来自作者本人的世界观和价值观。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回顾日本漫画史，就会发现，之前各个时期的漫画家们，所处的时代都给予了他们足够丰富的生活体验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最早一批漫画家，例如手冢治虫和藤子·F·不二雄，亲身经历过二战和战后日本的重建。他们在作品中能够很好地把握战争和人类命运这一类宏大命题。例如，手冢治虫的《火鸟》是日本漫画史上至今无法超越的关于宇宙和生命这一主题的宏大作品。而藤子不二雄的《哆啦A梦》，即使是面向儿童的搞笑漫画，也不忘让哆啦A梦和野比大雄在作品中笑着欢呼：“日本战败了！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后的一代日本漫画家，则亲身经历了六七十年代的日本左翼运动，这影响了他们作品中探讨社会命题的深度和价值。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接下来，随着日本经济在1980年代的腾飞，这个年代成长起来的漫画家们具有超越前辈的国际性视野。他们的作品，也开始真正将目光投向日本以外的真实世界。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当下的年轻漫画作者们，所处的是经济泡沫破灭之后的“失去的三十年”的日本。与经济停滞相应的，是日本社会发展缓慢，以及流行文化的孤岛化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这种环境下成长起来的漫画作者们，不仅难以理解真正的国家与国家之间的关系，甚至就连理解社会运作的逻辑也存在困难。这就导致现在大量的日本漫画，在前期还处在校园范围内时，剧情和人物看上去还算不错。一旦后期剧情发展超出了学校的范围，人物逻辑和世界设定就会出现各种槽点，最终导致烂尾。近年来大热一时的作品，例如《辉夜大小姐想让我告白～天才们的恋爱头脑战～》《约定的梦幻岛》《BEASTARS》等皆是如此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从这个角度来看，《巨人》这样的作品，对于现在的日本漫画界来说，是可遇不可求的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;世界构建的难度只是一方面，《巨人》能有现在的热度，主要是因为它在结尾之前对故事节奏的控制。 《巨人》漫画在90话之前，做到了“信息不对称”应该有的魅力。各种隐藏线索一点一点地展示出来，逐渐拼凑出完整的世界。在这个过程中，漫画前后的伏笔、照应，可以称得上草蛇灰线、伏脉千里。这种探寻的乐趣，是《巨人》最吸引人的地方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，如果不苛求世界观的真实可信，而是去问“日本漫画能否再出现一个像《巨人》这样故事精彩，同时又不烂尾的作品”呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;似乎也不容易。这是因为，对于一部以连载形式发布的漫画作品来说，前面情节的引人入胜，和最终结尾的烂尾，实际上是高度正相关的。连载这种形式，就决定了日本漫画是一项“杀君马者道旁儿”的事情。想要在高度内卷的日本漫画界抓住读者的眼球，就必然需要在漫画前期做出各种“语不惊人死不休”的反常桥段。这些桥段，越是违反日常的行为逻辑，就越容易引起读者的兴趣。但是，为了故事的正常进行，在接下来的情节当中，作者又必须要给这些反常的桥段一个合理的解释。这本身就是一件几乎无法完成的任务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几乎所有的日本漫画，都存在这样的问题。比如《海贼王》的槽点之一：整部漫画战力的天花板，四皇之一的红发，为什么会在漫画开篇，被一只海怪咬掉一只胳膊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让这种情况雪上加霜的是，日本漫画高强度的更新频率。作为周刊的日本漫画，一般要求漫画作者每周更新十几页内容，月刊则一般是每期三十到四十页内容。在这期间，作者要完成故事和台词构思和分镜设计，以及从草稿到最终成品的漫画绘制。虽然绝大多数漫画家会雇佣不止一位助手，但是漫画作者的工作强度仍然远超一般人想象。在这种持续性高强度的工作状态下，很难期待漫画作者保持故事的精巧构思。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比之下，《巨人》对前期各种伏笔和线索的巧妙处理，在日本漫画中显得如此不同寻常。也正是前面人物和故事线的不断增加，抬高了整个故事收尾的难度，也拔高了读者们的期待。这一切，成了摆在作者谏山创面前的一道无法解决的难题。最终，他选择了一个让广大读者不解的结尾方式。这种遗憾，细想起来难以避免。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[第十一届茅盾文学奖颁奖，专访茅奖新晋得主]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260851]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On the evening of November 19, the 11th Mao Dun Literature Award Awards Ceremony was held in Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province, the hometown of Mr. Mao Dun.

She then coughed up yellow and white sticky sputum that was difficult to cough up, especially at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, Ms. Zhu came to the outpatient department of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Second Provincial Hospital to seek treatment. Dr. He Yaowei discovered through chest CT examination that she had an infectious lesion in the lower lobe of her right lung, so she was admitted to the hospital to further improve the examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The doctor found through bronchoscopy that there was a large amount of yellow-white sticky sputum in Ms. Zhu&#39;s right lower lung bronchus.

In other words, Ms. Zhu suffered from the recently popular &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of her situation, the doctor gave her levofloxacin for targeted anti-infection and symptomatic support treatment such as cough and phlegm reduction.

Therefore, it is clinically distinguished from Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae and acute pneumonia. Pneumonia caused by other atypical pathogens such as grammaticis is collectively referred to as &quot;primary atypical pneumonia&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current epidemiological survey results of multiple adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in China show that Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are important pathogens of adult CAP in my country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports, the incubation period of mycoplasma pneumonia is 1 to 3 weeks, and the onset is diverse. Most patients only have low fever and fatigue, and some patients may have sudden high fever accompanied by obvious headache and myalgia. and nausea and other systemic symptoms of poisoning. The most prominent respiratory symptoms are dry cough, which often lasts for more than 4 weeks, is often accompanied by obvious sore throat, occasionally chest pain, and blood in sputum. In a few severe cases, respiratory failure may occur, manifesting as respiratory distress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the non-respiratory symptoms, earache, measles-like or scarlet fever-like rash are more common, and a few patients may be accompanied by gastroenteritis, pericarditis, myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, and hemolysis. anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, arthritis and hepatitis, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having few positive signs in the lungs and obvious imaging manifestations are important features of mycoplasma pneumonia. The lesions are mostly cloud-like patchy infiltrates with blurred edges and low density, radiating from the hilum to the peripheral lung fields. When the lung parenchyma is involved, large consolidation shadows may also appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quinols and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice for adults with mycoplasma pneumonia&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports, commonly used drugs for the treatment of mycoplasma pneumonia include macrolides, fluoroquinolones and Tetracyclines and macrolide antibiotics (such as azithromycin and clarithromycin) are currently the drugs of choice for the treatment of mycoplasma pneumonia in children. Quinolones and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice for adults with mycoplasma pneumonia. However, there are also mycoplasma pneumoniae and macrolide antibiotics. Lactone antibiotics are resistant, so the clinical selection should be based on the individual situation of the patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Will mycoplasma pneumonia cause &quot;white lung&quot;? A small number of mycoplasma pneumonias invade a wide range of lesions or have poor mucus drainage, involving the bronchi, alveoli, and interstitium of the lungs, causing &quot;atelectasis&quot; and even &quot;white lungs&quot; on imaging.
