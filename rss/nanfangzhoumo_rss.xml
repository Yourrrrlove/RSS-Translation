Hu Shi&#39;s father, Hu Chuan, was the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture at the time. Hu Shi recalled that his father was &quot;unable to &quot;Willing to release&quot; delayed medical treatment and died, and most academic circles gave a conclusion of &quot;death from illness&quot;. The author discovered from the diary of Yuan Chang, a disciple of Zhang Zhidong, that Hu Chuan was imprisoned and blackmailed by Liu Yongfu, which worsened his condition and died on the ship back to Xiamen. Liu Yongfu finally let him go because Yuan Chang asked Zhang Zhidong to intervene. Yuan Chang was killed in 1900 for speaking out. He was a loyal and upright person, and his record deserves attention. The content of Yuan Chang&#39;s record is consistent with Hu Shi&#39;s recollection, but the wording is slightly different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi&#39;s father&#39;s official name was Hu Chuan, also known as Shousan and Shoushan, also known as Tiehua and Blunt Man. He experienced twists and turns in his life. He went north to Ninggu Pagoda, south to Hainan Li District, and finally arrived in Taiwan. The governor of Dongzhili Prefecture. For a long time, people have been under the impression that Hu Chuan died of illness. Luo Ergang, a disciple of Hu Shi and the famous scholar who compiled &quot;Hu Tiehua&#39;s Manuscripts&quot;, also agrees with this theory. There are many people who hold this view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author also believes that Hu Chuan died of illness, but he died of an aggravation of his illness due to delays in treatment in captivity, and did not die of a normal illness. Hu Shi recalled: &quot;My father was in Taitung in charge of the defense of Houshan. Telegraphs were blocked and his salary source was cut off. At that time, he had suffered from beriberi and could no longer move his left foot. He stayed there until the third day of the fifth lunar month before leaving. Back Mountain, when they arrived in Anping, Liu Yongfu insisted on keeping him for help and refused to let him go. By June 25, he could no longer move his feet, so Liu Yongfu let him go. On June 28, he arrived in Xiamen. He could no longer move, and he died in Xiamen on July 3rd.&quot; (Hu Shi&#39;s &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;) Hu Shi later added: &quot;But in my &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;, I stated that my father&#39;s death was due to beriberi. It can be cured. My father originally wanted to rush to Shanghai to seek medical treatment, but because Liu Yongfu refused to let him go, it was delayed for nearly two months. It was not until he was critically ill that he was let go. He arrived in Xiamen on June 28th and arrived in Xiamen in early July. He died at the age of three. My original intention (and the opinion of my late brother and late mother) is that my late father’s death was due to Liu Yongfu’s refusal to let him go.” (Hu Songping’s “First Draft of the Long Chronicle of Mr. Hu Shizhi”, Volume 1 Page 27) The person accompanying Hu Chuan that day was Hu Shi&#39;s second brother Shaozhi, who was also responsible for carrying the coffin back home. The situation described by Hu Shi should come from his second brother. Hu Shi&#39;s addition is extremely important and is consistent with Yuan Chang&#39;s diary records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Yongfu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading Hu Chuan&#39;s &quot;Taiwan Diary&quot;, he wrote to Tang Jingsong on the 6th of May, requesting &quot;to open a vacancy and return to his hometown for medical treatment&quot; and &quot;recover as soon as he obtains Yuan Shuangqiu&#39;s observation book from South Anhui Province.&quot; This diary entry proves that Hu Chuo&#39;s intention was to return to the mainland for medical treatment, and that he had frequent correspondence with Yuan Chang. Yuan Chang&#39;s official position at this time was Guangtai Road, Ningchi, Anhui Province, referred to as &quot;Wannan Road&quot;. Because he was stationed in Wuhu, he was sometimes referred to as &quot;Wuhu Road&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;, Hu Chuan was &quot;imprisoned and deprived of food&quot; by Liu Yongfu, which caused his condition to worsen. He died on the ship, and only a corpse arrived in Xiamen. Yuan Chang was a student admitted by Zhang Zhidong when he was the deputy chief examiner of Zhejiang Province in his early years. Yuan Chang&#39;s &quot;Diary of a Sanren in Bixietai Mountain&quot; collected in &quot;Diaries of the Past Dynasties&quot; has the same content as Sun Zhimei&#39;s punctuated version of &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;. It is an abridged copy of reading notes and a small number of notes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the diary, in the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896), he met Chen Wenluo (Chen Zhongying) and recalled what happened the previous year. Yuan Chang wrote in 1896: &quot;Chen Zhongying once guarded Tainan. He talked about how his deceased friend Hu Shousan (biography) was an official in Taitung Prefecture. He asked Liu Yongfu for a bribe of 20,000 yuan for the commander-in-chief Liu Yongfu, but he couldn&#39;t get it. He was imprisoned and had no food or drink. Yongfu originally surrendered to the thieves. It is a true act of thieves. I went to Xia to beg the governor Zhang Gong to interrogate Liu, and released Huzhou as a pastor. Before crossing the Taiwan Strait to Xiamen, he drank wine on a ship. He was so angry that he could not pursue his ambition and became ill.&quot; (Compiled by Sun Zhimei, &quot;Yuan Chang&quot; (Diary, Volume 2, page 1224) Chen Wenluo was appointed as the prefect of Taipei in 1892. He had never been stationed in Tainan, but he obeyed the order to cross over in May. Chen Wenluo is a colleague of Hu Chuan. His official experience makes his testimony irreplaceable and authoritative, and he is closest to the historical scene. Jiawu and Yiweizhangzhidong were in charge of the governor of Liangjiang, and Wuhu Road was under the governor of Liangjiang. According to the diary, it was Yuan Chang who asked Zhang Zhidong to call Liu Yongfu to release Hu Chuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the governors of the late Qing Dynasty, Zhang Zhidong paid the most attention to Yiwei Taiwan. Tang Jingsong, the governor of Taiwan, and Liu Yongfu, the assistant general of Nan&#39;ao Town, Taiwan Defense, were all supported and commanded by Zhang Zhidong during the Sino-French War. , Hu Chuanze inspected the Li District of Hainan in 1887 on the order of Zhang Zhidong. These three people all have deep connections with Zhang Zhidong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation in Taiwan during the Yiwei period was very complicated. Zhang Zhidong, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, ostensibly complied with the imperial court&#39;s decision to cede Taiwan. He also secretly supported Tang Jingsong and Liu Yongfu in resisting Japan and protecting Taiwan, and provided money and weapons. However, after receiving a telegram from the imperial court to challenge him, he stopped and left Tang and Liu to their own devices. Decide on orientation. Tang and Liu were originally famous generals who fought against the French, but were misled by their fame. They initially decided to stay in Taiwan to fight against the Japanese. However, their military strength could not last long. Tang Jingsong soon sneaked back to the mainland, while Liu Yongfu was &quot;overshadowed&quot; by others. Liu Yongfu felt that he had been tricked by Zhang Zhidong. When most of the local officials had been transferred inland, it was impossible to detain Hu Chuan, the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture, to demand payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Liu Yongfu cut off support from the mainland, it was a relatively simple way to obtain military pay from local officials. After careful reading of what Chen Wenluo said about &quot;asking for bribes,&quot; I feel that it is more reasonable to interpret it as &quot;asking for salary.&quot; Liu Yongfu detained Hu Chuan and &quot;deprived him of food and drink in captivity.&quot; However, Hu Chuan had no cash in his hands, and it was very difficult to raise wages as the Japanese troops advanced deeper and deeper. Yuan Chang from Wuhu Road asked Zhang Zhidong for help and called Liu Yongfu to release him. Hu Chuan died on the ship returning to Xiamen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Chuan died because he was imprisoned by Liu Yongfu and fasted, which delayed his treatment and his condition worsened. This was not a normal death. During the Sino-French War, Tang Jingsong took the initiative to sneak into Vietnam and fight alongside Liu Yongfu. He had a relatively deep understanding of Liu Yongfu. In 1884, he reported to the court through Cen Yuying, the governor of Yunnan and Guizhou, saying that Liu Yongfu &quot;valued wealth too much, treated his subordinates unkindly, and showed no mercy.&quot; No discipline.&quot; (Page 91 of Volume 1 of &quot;The Telegram of Duke Zhang Wenxiang (Unpublished)&quot;) Linking this phrase with the way he treated Hu Chuan in 1895, another side of Liu Yongfu&#39;s character becomes apparent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在何种情况下，以色列会使用核武器？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259428]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/lPGP575q0cEcOl9oyhbIVi2CCvaUQuFNCyKKvSjE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/lPGP575q0cEcOl9oyhbIVi2CCvaUQuFNCyKK vSjE. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255391&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The northern Gaza Strip was attacked in Sderot, Israel, on October 23, 2023. Thick smoke rising after Israeli air strikes &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Israeli Knesset member &quot;Tali&quot; Gotliff (Revital &quot;Tally&quot; Gotliv) actually told the media that Israel should use nuclear weapons to retaliate against Hamas&#39;s attacks on Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gotliff also wrote on her social media: &quot;Jericho missile! Jericho missile! Strategic alert. Before considering troops entering. Doomsday weapon (used)! This is mine Viewpoint. May God bless us with all our strength.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She later publicly declared that &quot;only an explosion that shook the Middle East can restore this country (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;means Israel&lt;/span>;) dignity, strength and security! It’s time to kiss the end of the world. Launch powerful missiles without limit. Don’t level a neighborhood, smash and level the entire Gaza…nothing Show no mercy! Show no mercy!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, this is an outright nuclear threat. Gottliff is a lawyer and an opponent of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Her remarks have always been known for being extreme and crazy, so her extreme remarks this time were not regarded by anyone as a serious nuclear threat. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we have to admit the fact that Israel is indeed the only country in the Middle East that possesses nuclear weapons, and it almost decided to use nuclear weapons to save the defeat in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there is now a lot of public opinion that if anti-Israel allies such as Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah join the war, Hamas&#39;s goal of completely destroying Israel is expected to be achieved. But even if we do not take into account the fact that the combined conventional military strength of these opponents is still far behind that of Israel, as well as the fact that two US aircraft carriers are within easy reach, and only consider the existence of Israel&#39;s nuclear power, if Israel is completely defeated, this war will be The possibility of escalation to a nuclear war cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So is Israel ready to use nuclear weapons in reality? To answer this question, we first need to understand what kind of nuclear power Israel has and what is the positioning of its nuclear strategy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Israel does not accept the supervision of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Israeli government has always implemented a vague nuclear strategy, neither admitting nor denying the possession of nuclear weapons, and has not announced the deployment of its nuclear weapons to the outside world, the outside world is very concerned. It is difficult to know exactly how many nuclear weapons Israel possesses and whether the nuclear weapons are in a state of war readiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The international arms control research community now generally believes that Israel possesses at least 90 nuclear weapons and also retains key nuclear materials that can produce 200-300 nuclear weapons. Although Israel&#39;s nuclear weapons are very small, it is one of the very few countries with a triad of nuclear strike capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel has the Jericho medium-range ballistic missile with a range that can cover the entire Middle East and parts of Africa and Asia. This system is considered the core of Israel’s land-based nuclear strike force, among which the latest Jericho The Type 3 missile has a range of up to 4,800 kilometers, enough to cover Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, and even Moscow, the capital of Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both the Israeli Air Force’s F-16 and F-15 fighter jets are capable of carrying nuclear bombs. The outside world even generally believes that Israel’s customized F-35 fighter jets will have the ability to drop nuclear bombs. It is expected that the Israeli Air Force’s There are at least 30 aerial nuclear bombs similar to the American B-61 type in the arsenal. This is the core of Israel&#39;s first-hand nuclear strike force. It maintains a very high level of combat readiness and can launch nuclear attacks from the air at any time, posing a threat to surrounding hostile countries. Very big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel is also one of the very few countries with underwater nuclear forces. Although it is not equipped with nuclear-powered submarines, the Dolphin-class conventionally powered submarines in service in its navy are equipped with nuclear cruise missiles. The Israeli Army and Air Force Even if they no longer exist, the submarine force can still carry out doomsday strike missions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This triad of nuclear strike capabilities enables Israel, despite its small land area, to possess nuclear combat capabilities that surpass those of Britain and France. It is one of the few countries that can carry out preemptive nuclear strikes against major deterrence targets. If Israel really faces the risk of national annihilation, it is very likely to use nuclear weapons at the last moment in a desperate move. In fact, Israel&#39;s nuclear deterrent took shape after the Fourth Middle East War. This was also one of the strategic considerations for secular Arab countries such as Egypt to normalize relations with Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Congressman Gotliff’s statement that nuclear weapons should be used in Gaza is obviously just a personal statement. No matter how crazy Israel is, the radiation fallout after the nuclear explosion is an unacceptable and catastrophic consequence for Israel, which is very close. However, if the war expands and Iran directly participates in the war, then Israel&#39;s use of nuclear weapons is not an impossible option. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, Israel conducted a joint exercise with the United States to attack Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities, and Israel&#39;s combat plan is likely to include the option of launching a nuclear strike against Iran in extreme circumstances. This Hamas attack is generally considered to be the worst situation Israel has encountered after the Yom Kippur War. If Israel had prepared for a nuclear strike in 1973, it is not ruled out that there will be relevant plans this time. What&#39;s worse is that the number and means of use of the Israeli military&#39;s nuclear weapons have now far exceeded those of the past. Therefore, the international community should be alert to the possibility and harm of Israel preparing to use nuclear weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一碗海鲜面和便民热线]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259434]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;During the holidays, my husband and I joined in the fun and went to an island with the outdoor club. When we arrived at the island, it was already lunch time, so let’s look for seafood noodles. Who let seafood noodles be my obsession? I turned into a restaurant and found that it was a fast food restaurant. I asked casually, &quot;Are there any seafood noodles?&quot;, and the answer was, &quot;Yes, you can prepare seafood by yourself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, I happily served myself chilled shrimp, clams and dragonhead fish. The store owner asked me if I wanted razor clams. I told me that I didn’t want to eat razor clams because they would cause abdominal pain. The store owner took my selected seafood to the kitchen. I also remembered the club leader’s reminder to ask how much it would cost to eat seafood noodles. Last time she went there to eat, she was overcharged a lot without asking, so she specifically asked the price. The boss paused and said it was 48 yuan. I was a little surprised and thought to myself, this seafood noodle has never cost more than 30 yuan this year, but now it has increased by more than 50%? After thinking about it again, 48 yuan is not a big amount, so I acquiesced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After waiting for a while, the seafood noodles arrived. Because I was hungry, I picked up my chopsticks and ate it. I barely tasted it, but I found a lot of things wrong with it: Why was there razor clams in it? I chose three dragonhead fish that are more than ten centimeters long. Why are there only three small sections? Why is the shell of the shrimp so crispy and the meat of the shrimp so dry? It doesn’t look like it’s fresh, but it looks like it’s been dried in the sun? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My husband ate fast food. He ate before me and paid for it after he finished eating. After eating, I felt dissatisfied and argued with the boss, questioning whether the ingredients were out of the bag. This is great, three or four people in the store surrounded us, talking all over the place, and arrogantly denying my doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I asked: &quot;Who is in charge of your store?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Me,&quot; the boss said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Okay, everyone else shut up. We will negotiate with you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boss asked: &quot;What do you want to do?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I said: &quot; Refund my money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asked: &quot;Full refund?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I thought about it and said, &quot;That&#39;s not true. I also ate the noodles, so I will refund 20 yuan. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boss&#39;s eyes widened and he raised his voice: &quot;What? Impossible! Just go and complain!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I really didn&#39;t think of complaining before, but when he said this, I It got so popular that I directly dialed the 12345 hotline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About an hour later, I received a call, saying that it was from the Market Supervision Bureau. They had arrived at the scene and asked me if I had complained about the store adding extra razor clams to the seafood noodles. When I heard this, I was very surprised that the packaging of ingredients was so fresh and refined. I quickly said, I will review the matter for you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After repeating it briefly and concisely, the other party said that he would wait for him to verify it before making any decision. After a while, a call came, saying that no dried shrimps were found in the kitchen, and the razor clams were put in by mistake. I had no corresponding evidence, so I would not handle it. I said, I don’t accept this result. The boss had no fear from the beginning and asked me to “just complain.” Did he know that your arms would be bent inwards? I will continue to complain to the higher-level department. The previous complaints were: 1. The price deviated from the market and was suspected of robbing customers; 2. Ingredients were swapped; 3. The attitude was bad. If you insist on this attitude, then add another one: local protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;50 minutes later, I got a call. First, the boss was willing to apologize to me for his attitude and the wrong ingredients, and second, he was willing to refund 20 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should we be happy that things have come to this? No, no, no, I&#39;m not happy at all. Not only does it taste bad to eat a bowl of seafood noodles, but you actually have to call 12345, and the market supervisor will make you a mess. Although the matter was finally dealt with, I always felt that without my &quot;threat&quot;, the matter would have been settled. It would be frustrating if the resolution of the matter depends on such &quot;threats&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always trusted 12345 because of her awareness of serving the people, because of her efficient work efficiency, and because of her responsive and well-organized style of doing everything. In my complaint, the corresponding functional department personnel rushed to the scene in more than an hour, and the work efficiency was not high. But if we talk about the matter, I think there are still flaws in the handling of this matter. If I had a fair heart and was not partial to local businesses and not perfunctory to foreign tourists, then I wouldn’t feel so sorry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That evening, we came to an internet celebrity village on this island. We saw someone eating seafood noodles, so we asked the price and were told 30 yuan. The seafood noodles were made by an old couple who were over seventy years old. I asked them what kind of seafood was put in the seafood noodles. The old woman replied that there were live shrimps, razor clams, clams, and a poached egg. We happily ordered two bowls of seafood noodles, and my husband ate all the razor clams in them. It felt good to enjoy the sea breeze, listen to the waves, and watch the moon rise little by little. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While we were eating noodles, I saw this old couple selling more than a dozen bowls of noodles. I did a rough calculation and found that a bowl of noodles costs about 10 yuan, so their income for a day is quite considerable. A bowl of seafood noodles costs 30 yuan. The store makes a profit and tourists can accept it. What a harmonious ecology! I can’t understand why some businesses still want to rip off customers. Are they not afraid of losing their own business? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a retired teacher)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt; /span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Every aspect of her life reminds her that she is fat, and &quot;fat&quot; occupies almost all of her life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fu Doudou challenged himself to get stuck in the second-class seat of the high-speed train.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The following is the self-report of &quot;plus-size girl&quot; Fu Doudou:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;We are a group that cannot speak&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;My name is Fu Doudou, but my surname is not Fu. My first friend in kindergarten was named Fu. I couldn&#39;t contact her for many years. I named her this name to commemorate her. &quot;Dolphin&quot; came from my dad jokingly saying one day that I looked like a dolphin tossing and turning on the bed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But I didn’t expect that netizens could associate “pig” with “dolphin”. I have been unable to lose weight because I have hypothyroidism and thyroid disease. Growing up, I was always called a &quot;fat pig&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I planned to shoot a video of riding the high-speed train in the early stage. I didn’t dare to go to a place that was too far away. My friend said that I would go to Qingyuan, which is less than half a mile from Guangzhou. Hours. I said try it and went straight over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After I squeezed into the high-speed train seat, I suddenly found that it was much higher than the next door. My butt was a little nervous, and my lower back was very tight because of the fat. The skirt I was wearing was a little puffy, and I didn&#39;t dare to close the armrests for fear that my body would overflow like water, which would be very embarrassing. The same thing happened when I walked down the aisle. I took up the entire aisle in that tutu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When they first told me that Weibo was popular, my first reaction was to go home and hide, and asked fans and colleagues if they could read the comments for me. , I don’t dare to look at it, it seems like I will be bullied by the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before posting the video, I guessed that some people might scold it, but I didn’t expect that netizens would scold it in such a variety of ways that I couldn’t even watch it. A fan spoke up for me online and was criticized by more than 7,000 netizens. Some people said that I was not plus size, but extra large. I also received a private message from a girl, &quot;I suggest you commit suicide, disgusting stuff&quot;, and then she blocked me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A private message received by Fu Doudan after the video became popular.

Picture provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Interestingly, there are also many people who like me. They may comment &quot;I like you&quot; or &quot;You are beautiful&quot;. There are also many plus-size sisters who say that they have also encountered this problem and have been called &quot;fat pigs&quot; since they were children. It feels like we are an ordinary group, but we are also a group that cannot speak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As soon as we go out, we will be discussed. We can&#39;t even maintain a peaceful mind. It just so happens that everyone is silent. Maybe everyone thinks they are an exception and no one will help us if we speak out. Some people are disgusted with us when they see us. I was spat on by an old man in a village in the city before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Once, I was waiting for the bus on the side of the road, and a couple next to me was discussing me. The woman said, &quot;If you were so fat, would you still love me?&quot; The man said, &quot;How could you be as fat as a pig? I will love you.&quot; They got on the bus with me and talked to me all the way on the bus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some time ago, I was suddenly grabbed by someone at the subway entrance. It was a girl about my age. She asked me how much I weighed, and I said 286 pounds. She said, &quot;You are still eating like this. No wonder you have gained so much weight. It is easy for you to die like this.&quot; Although I look big, I am always the one who cries when we quarrel with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people also say that if I were a boy, I might not be said like this. Because in popular belief, taller boys are more likely to be beaten violently when provoked, but girls may tolerate it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I cannot participate in many occasions&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sometimes, it is easy for others to do it It&#39;s hard for me to do things. I will think about whether I want to do it in advance to avoid encountering very embarrassing points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, when I enter the subway, I rarely sit. I usually stand in the corner, because when I sit down, I will occupy 1.5 seats. Sometimes as soon as I sit down, the person next to me will automatically bounce away. Another reason is that fat people do sweat easily and wear less in summer, which makes them embarrassed if they meet others. I have never stepped on other people&#39;s toes since I was a child, nor have I ever gone out of my way to squeeze past others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have never been to other cities, and I have never been on a plane until now. I&#39;ve always been so crowded when taking high-speed trains. The plane is even narrower and may not be able to accommodate me. I broke two swivel chairs while sitting on them at work. I also backed out of the elevator silently before because I was overweight. It was very embarrassing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are even more embarrassing things. I was renting a house once. I didn&#39;t want to damage the landlord&#39;s mattress, so I replaced it with my own thin mattress. As a result, when I sat down, a butt-sized hole appeared in the synthetic board underneath and it sank. The bed board had to be recycled. When the staff lifted the bed board down, I covered my face and tried to find a crack in the floor to crawl in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I don’t often go to dinner parties. I will check in advance whether the stools in this store can accommodate me. There are some plastic stools in food stalls. It is easy for us to fall when we sit on them, and even break other people’s stools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I go out to stay in a hotel, I am always worried that the bed will collapse, so I will check the bed in advance. There is nothing that I can settle on casually. Although it is a bit exaggerated to say this, it is true. Every time I travel, I will read a lot of things in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is also one of the reasons why I am relatively introverted, because I cannot participate in many occasions. Sometimes when everyone goes out to play, I can’t play this or that. As friends, they don&#39;t want me to be alone. They might stay with me, but I don&#39;t want that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also gyms chasing me to sell cards, and I will be surrounded when I walk on the road. They all think of me like a big customer, the kind of long-term card holder. In fact, I do this, I have always had a fitness card, and I bought it from different places. Since 2016, I have been applying for an annual pass near the school and going there whenever I have time. I did it after work, and it turned out to be a very expensive course, costing more than 100 yuan per class. In the end, the gym ran away, and I still had more than 20 classes to attend, which was a huge loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am so familiar with their sales techniques that I can recite them by heart. Not long ago, a salesperson from a health care product store took me to play games in the store, and I had a lot of fun. happy. Then he came out with a product that said he would lose weight after drinking it. They thought I was easy to deceive, but he did make money from me. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Life is all about losing weight”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have a bad memory, and occasionally I feel sad when I think about some sad things. One day, they asked me what I had experienced in losing weight. I cried while thinking about it. I remembered many experiences and couldn’t stop crying. Being fat has indeed put a lot of psychological shadow on me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am from Cantonese and grew up in the south. People around me are as thin as poles. But when I was in the second grade of elementary school, I weighed 80 kilograms and looked round. In junior high school, I weighed 120 kilograms and was 1.68 meters tall. When I weighed more than 160 kilograms in high school, my classmates called me macho. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;My brother has been thinner than me since he was a child. When we go out, they all say that I steal all my brother’s food. In fact, I don’t. We both eat the same thing all the time. thing. When I was in school, my classmates would treat me as a strong man, carrying books, water and things, and I would be asked to throw a shot put at sports events. But in fact, fat people are not necessarily strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;My whole life is to lose weight. I have been trying to lose weight, but I have never succeeded. I am very depressed. As long as you eat a little bit of carbohydrates, your weight will quickly increase, and exercise will be useless. Looking at the food outside, you can’t buy this one, and that one is high in calories. For example, I don’t eat sugar-fried chestnuts, and I can’t touch the fried rice noodles, rice noodles, and rice rolls that are very common in Guangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was in college, in order to better integrate into the group, I went on a diet to lose weight, and I did lose more than 20 pounds. However, I had health problems, hair loss, and physiological problems. Period is also disordered. And when I&#39;m hungry, I get panicky and feel exhausted. I couldn&#39;t keep on losing weight for various reasons, and that kind of giving up has been in my life for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Last year, I signed up for a weight-loss training camp, where I trained for three months off-duty, and the tuition was 15,000 yuan. Among the 60 students, there are maybe six or seven who are similar in size to me, and we encourage each other. I get up at around 7 o&#39;clock in the morning and do aerobics, do strength barbell and dumbbell exercises in the afternoon, and ride spinning bikes in the evening. A group of people are like a disco. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Practice for four to five hours every day. There are only three spoons of rice in one meal, paired with a small grid of vegetarian dishes and a small grid of meat. But because I ate too little, I wasn’t able to exercise vigorously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the third month of training, everyone was coughing, but they still did aerobics while coughing. The whole private room was filled with the sound of coughing, which was very loud. So a plus-size girl doesn’t want to lose weight? Doesn&#39;t she want to work hard? We persisted for 3 months, but in the end I only lost 22 pounds. I asked the coach, I didn’t eat anything secretly, why couldn’t I lose weight? He said, &quot;Just don&#39;t eat it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later I went to the hospital for a check-up, and 11 tubes of blood were drawn, and insulin resistance and hypothyroidism were found. My function is poor and I lose weight slower than most people. Maybe a normal person loses one or two pounds a day when losing weight, but I only lose one or two pounds a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2022, Fu Doudan participated in a weight-loss training camp.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am indeed rejected in many environments and cannot be accommodated at home. Sixty percent of the reasons are because of my figure. My parents may tell others about how awesome their son is, but they never tell others about it because they feel ashamed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So I rarely go home and I don’t dare to go back. People say it every time. Many relatives would advise me to lose weight, and I could recite what they had to say. My mom would point to a plate and ask me, &quot;Do you know what this is? Your face is so round.&quot; You knew she was joking, but knives always cut through the heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I retreat to the point of no return, I will only jump into a bigger pit, and I will really jump. For a period of time, I was ostracized at work and had tense relationships at home. I couldn&#39;t lose weight, and I felt very frustrated. Our company is on the 18th floor. I stepped on the railing and wanted to jump off. It happened that a friend I met from work nearby sent me a message asking me if I wanted to go out for an ice cream. That message suddenly woke me up, and it seemed like someone cared about me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I think I may really have no way to survive. I ate alone, walked alone, hid in the house and didn’t want to see anyone, had a few breakdowns, was depressed, and spent a year in a very silent state. That year. My brother calls once a month and he only asks, are you okay? Still alive? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Until later, the relationship with my family eased a bit and I slowly came out of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Do something you are afraid of&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Change started from a field activity . I used to build a team with people from the company, and dozens of people went to ride mountain bikes and off-road vehicles. As soon as the game started, everyone ran 100 meters away, but my motorcycle kept stalling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I was also very anxious and didn’t want to fall behind. The coach next to me said impatiently, “It’s very dangerous for you to do this. Don’t drive. I’ll refund your money.” .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;My colleague couldn&#39;t stand it. He said to the coach, &quot;If they don&#39;t know it, you teach them. Why do you ask them to come down?&quot; I was very moved. , no one has supported me like this for a long time. After the coach taught me, I just started driving and my car crashed again. The coach said again, &quot;Don&#39;t drive. Come down and I will refund the ticket and the insurance to you.&quot; I said if you let me try again, just try again. That time I really drove up, even though I stalled the engine more than a dozen times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Did you know? When we reached a very high altitude, my car almost turned over. The slope is very steep, and the car has to rush up quickly. My weight may slow down the speed. But later I saw that it was not only me who couldn&#39;t pass that stretch of road, but also many other people, some of whom were too light, and the car really overturned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After reaching the top of the mountain, several coaches asked me to take a photo. I thought they were joking on me again, but I heard a coach say, &quot;This girl is great. She kept stalling at the beginning, and now she is driving here, and she is really great.&quot; He praised me, and I felt warm in my heart that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fu Doudou rides an off-road motorcycle.

Others may have ups and downs in their lives, but I have always been there. Volt. In short, this incident made me feel brave for the first time, and also made me reflect on the fact that some things cannot be stopped. If I gave up at the beginning, I would not have that sense of accomplishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another time, a friend from the gym caught me hiking and made an appointment to go to a relatively high scenic spot and climb hundreds of steps. At first, I didn&#39;t dare to go up. There was a sister who pulled me on every level. Every time I went up a dozen or so steps, I looked back, thinking about how I would get down later. In the end, I lay down on the steps and tried to go down. Move down step by step. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They helped me, but I said no. I was afraid that I would fall down with you, and my heart rate soared to 180 that day. But every time I do something I dare not do, I gain more courage. Later, I also challenged myself to ride roller coasters and merry-go-rounds, and attractions such as the Chain Bridge. I couldn&#39;t accept it before, and I was always worried that it would break if I went on it, so I tried it later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am indeed afraid of all kinds of things. Maybe my life was all about losing weight before, but now I want to do some things that I&#39;m afraid of and enrich myself with other things. I also hope that the group of &quot;plus-size girls&quot; will stand up, be brave, and be seen by everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 18:25:11 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深秋青海：如诗如画]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259290]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家烟草专卖局原局长凌成兴落马，反腐震荡至烟草系统最高级别]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259432]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/JQJFMogZw7WnI1B7dpthiLXvmzRWXL7acvFQXdak.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/JQJFMogZw7WnI1B7dpthiLXvmzRWXL 7acvFQXdak. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255746&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ling Chengxing once proposed to &quot;prevent (tobacco control) from becoming expanded, one-sided, and absolute.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 23, 2023, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection reported that the former Party Secretary and Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration Ling Chengxing is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently undergoing disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that three days ago, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced that the Eighth Central Inspection Team will inspect the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration’s party group work mobilization meeting, which will “highlight the supervision of the ‘top leaders’ and leadership teams and conduct in-depth investigations. Corruption issues in key positions and key areas.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this year, many former officials of the State Tobacco Administration have been dismissed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Zehua, former member of the Party Leadership Group and deputy director, was investigated in July, and Zhang Hong, former director of the Department of Science and Technology, was investigated in July. Ling Chengxing is the highest-ranking official dismissed from the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration since its establishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Zhao Hongshun, a former party member and deputy director, was investigated in February 2019, and Pan Jiahua, a former party member and leader of the disciplinary inspection team, was investigated in January 2022. Zhao Hongshun was sentenced to life imprisonment in June 2020, and Pan Jiahua was sentenced to 11 years in prison in April 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The starting point of official career&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before Ling Chengxing was investigated, the tobacco system had been continuously shaken, and many department and bureau-level cadres were dismissed intensively across Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu and other places, among which Jiangxi, the starting point of Ling Chengxing&#39;s official career, was the hardest hit area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 1, 2023, Li Benjian, a former division-level cadre of the Jiangxi Tobacco Monopoly Bureau (Company), underwent disciplinary review and supervisory investigation. According to Caixin reports, this person once served as Ling Chengxing’s driver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 6, Zheng Wei, Party Secretary, Director and General Manager of the Guangdong Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau (Company), was dismissed. He was previously the General Manager of China Tobacco Jiangxi. On the same day, Fu Wujun, the first-level business manager of the Human Resources Department of China Tobacco Jiangxi, was subject to disciplinary review and supervisory investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanggao County in Jiangxi Province was the starting point of Ling Chengxing’s career. He started working in 1980 and was promoted to the Standing Committee and Deputy County Magistrate of Shanggao County at the age of 27. Thereafter, he served as director of the Jiangxi Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, and eventually became a member of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and executive deputy governor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Ling Chengxing was elected as a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress in Jiangxi. A media person who interviewed Ling Chengxing at the Two Sessions told Southern Weekend reporters that during the discussion, everyone still called Ling Chengxing &quot; Governor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retiring in 2018, Ling Chengxing was still very concerned about his hometown Shanggao. His only public appearance after retirement was to visit the water supply company in his hometown accompanied by the local county party secretary, county People’s Congress director and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Area hardest hit by corruption&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From 2013 to 2018, Ling Chengxing served as a member of the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group, and Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure, China&#39;s cigarette sales fell by 2.4% in 2015, the first decline since 1995, equivalent to smokers reducing their consumption of 60 billion cigarettes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that the tobacco tax will be raised by 6 percentage points starting from May 10, 2015. The price and tax rate of the cigarette wholesale link will be increased from 5% to 11%, and the price will be increased by 0.005 yuan/cigarette. A specific tax is levied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the trend of declining sales, Ling Chengxing, who has always been low-key, took the initiative to accept an interview with the &quot;Study Times&quot; sponsored by the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, proposing to &quot;prevent (tobacco control) from becoming expanded, one-sided, and absolute.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the National Two Sessions in 2015, this also became the focus of reporters’ questions. What is the expansion of tobacco control? Ling Chengxing replied: &quot;Let me give you an example. Some people say that bone hyperplasia is caused by smoking. I think this has no scientific basis. What do you think?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, China&#39;s cigarette sales stopped falling and rebounded. rose, with 47.378 million boxes sold throughout the year, an increase of 0.8% compared with 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the discussion of tobacco control, the tobacco industry’s government-enterprise integration system has always been the focus of discussion. In the eyes of the tobacco control party, the government-enterprise integration system has become the biggest obstacle to tobacco control in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ling Chengxing’s predecessor, former Party Secretary and Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, Jiang Chengkang, made the biggest institutional reform of China’s tobacco industry by promoting the “separation of industry and commerce” at the provincial level, but the reform failed to continue. further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Ling Chengxing took office, he followed the previous ideas and rapidly expanded the scale of the company through mergers and alliances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first stop for his research after taking office was in Yunnan. After the merger of Hongyun Group and Honghe Group, the newly established &quot;Hongyun Honghe Group&quot; became the largest group after Altria Group, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco. , the world&#39;s fifth largest tobacco group after Imperial Tobacco. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 30, 2013, a symposium on cultivating major brands of Yunzhen cigarettes was held in Mile County, Honghe Prefecture. Ling Chengxing, who had just taken over as the director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, issued the tobacco &quot;Policy Agenda&quot; for the first time: Adhere to &quot; &quot;Three Stabilities&quot; (the guiding ideology determined at the beginning of the year remains unchanged, the goals and tasks remain unchanged, and the work measures remain unchanged); maintain the &quot;Three Stabilities&quot; (stabilize the leadership team, stabilize the cadre team, and stabilize the morale of the employees); think, plan, and practice &quot;Three major issues&quot; (where are the dividends of tobacco industry reform, where is the potential for development, and where is the goal of catching up). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ling Chengxing also implemented a number of reforms during his tenure. Starting in 2014, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration issued the &quot;Key Points of the Market-oriented Reform of Cigarette Marketing&quot; for four consecutive years, but it was limited to the marketing level, focusing on &quot; How can commercial enterprises truly reflect market demand, how can industrial enterprises meet demand in a timely manner, and how can industrial and commercial enterprises respond to market demand in a timely manner?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike the previous &quot;foreign troubles&quot; in which China Tobacco faced direct competition with foreign brands, Ling Chengxing faced more internal management pressure. During his tenure, many major cases occurred in the tobacco system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, a scandal broke out in the Henan Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, and many people including the former director were arrested. There is also the case of Yang Weizu, chairman of Yunnan Ruisheng Group, who is associated with the Yunnan Tobacco Science Research Institute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, at least a dozen central officials in the tobacco system have been eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Ping, Party Secretary and General Manager of Hunan China Tobacco Industry Co., Ltd., was investigated in October 2020 and was suspected of accepting bribes of 413 million yuan and misappropriating public funds of 135 million yuan. This case is known as the most serious job-related crime in the tobacco system since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A disciplinary inspection cadre analyzed the causes of corruption in the tobacco system to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The tobacco system is different from other vertically managed departments. It is a system that integrates government and enterprises, and the path to realize power is very difficult. Short, all links are accompanied by indicators, which results in power being permanently concentrated in the hands of a few people and the lack of effective supervision, making it more difficult to fight corruption in the tobacco system.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tobacco Bureau even controls the money bags of local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An interesting detail is that during the National People’s Congress in 2015, a mayor publicly appealed to Ling Chengxing that he wanted to improve the quality of cigarette production. “It used to be that Septwolves were basically OEM, and the taxes and profits of Septwolves were relatively low. It would be great if the next step is to produce Chinese cigarettes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was refuted by Ling Chengxing on the spot, &quot;That&#39;s impossible. China Tobacco is a banner of the tobacco industry.&quot; The mayor said with a smile that “it may not all be the pen of the (old) governor” and suggested that better equipment could be invested in production. Ling Chengxing still insisted, &quot;When you come to engage in Zhonghua Cigarettes, you will immediately destroy the Zhonghua Cigarettes (brand).&quot; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the mayor continued, &quot;While the (old) provincial governor is in the position of the General Administration, a certain city&#39;s tobacco industry chain tax revenue can reach 10 billion yuan.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that this media record at the time was preserved under Ling Chengxing&#39;s instruction. According to an insider, &quot;He may have just wanted to show that he rejected the other party.&quot; The mayor who made this request was dismissed soon after because of his involvement in the Su Rong case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“啥都不用干”是最大的福气吗？ ]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259230]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Many people have said &quot;I don&#39;t want to work&quot; when they are sleepy or frustrated, but these words are probably inappropriate. Really, if we don’t have any mines or pie from the sky, what else can we do if we don’t move bricks honestly? But there are indeed some people who regard &quot;no work and someone to support you&quot; as the highest ideal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A blogger said that since childhood, her aunt has indoctrinated a bunch of little girls, including her, with the idea that girls are &quot;blessed&quot; and can enjoy a good life without doing anything. . Not only do you not have to do anything, but you marry a good family and you don&#39;t even need to take care of the children yourself. That is what you are blessed to do. This concept is close to &quot;labor equals shame&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all have inertia and a desire for comfort. In our subconscious, we may have had the image of just lying down and enjoying ourselves. When I was a kid, I experienced the intense itching pain all over my body after harvesting and threshing rice and wheat by hand. I also had &quot;plans&quot; to stop working. But honestly, just think about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The extravagant and luxurious life in books and movies is described in the wonderful lyrics of &quot;Huang Liang Meng&quot; by the Pingdiao Luozi Theater Company in Handan City, Hebei Province: &quot;Endless generosity, endless power; Endless delicacies to eat, endless money to spend; endless carols to listen to, endless gifts to receive; endless wealth to enjoy, endless New Years to live.&quot; Ordinary people can just think about it, and really educate themselves like this Children, that&#39;s really gone astray. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For ordinary people, when they are minors, they are supported by their parents, and when they become adults, they have to support themselves and their families on their own. If you want to live a good life, you can only accumulate it step by step. This is the first meaning of work for most people: to support their families. In order to achieve this goal, many people work very hard and may not be in a career they like, but they persist because this job can bring acceptable returns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is very painful to do a job that you don&#39;t like for a long time. A friend told me that the joyless days at work day after day were really a torture. But even so, we can&#39;t &quot;just leave&quot;, we can only wait for the opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My friend’s words moved me deeply. The reason why people should work hard is because work should have a second meaning: combining it with one&#39;s own talents and interests, making the work itself a source of fulfillment and happiness. Many writers have been doing writing work for a lifetime based on their talent and interest. I have also been a media commentator for many years based on my talent and interest. This is a blessing. There is also a kind of work that may seem heavy and tiring, but it may be something that workers like to do. For example, blacksmithing is not acceptable to most people, but in reality there are people who work very hard at it. I also heard a car mechanic say that although it may be tiring and dirty all day long, it is a job that interests him and cannot let him go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the values ​​that ordinary people should uphold, try to do meaningful work and live a meaningful life. In other words, a livelihood should be one that can not only meet the purpose of earning money to support the family, but also satisfy interests and hobbies. Accordingly, we not only get practical benefits, such as income and evaluation, but also spiritual satisfaction. This sense of gain is the spiritual source that enriches us in this world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people envy the financial freedom of wealthy families, but they only know one aspect but not the other. Even among the envied few &quot;giant pandas&quot; in society, most of them do not relax their requirements for their children. Instead, they pay more attention to providing high-quality education and scientific employment guidance to their children, and to promote their children to pursue a decent and respectable career. jobs and better realize the value of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually, these families need their children to inherit the family business. In order not to be left behind for this goal, they are motivated to help their children avoid becoming &quot;waste&quot; and &quot;dandy children&quot; who only consume high amounts of money and live in vain. Look at the young people who have inherited the family business of wealthy parents today. Which one has not experienced the nourishment of a good education and the tempering of basic work. Many people have the ability to protect their children from dust, but they still let them start from the &quot;workshop&quot; and perceive the meaning of life. This is true wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the many second-generation rich people do not sit around doing nothing all day long, eating, drinking, and waiting to die as some people imagine. In other words, people who are more &quot;qualified&quot; than ordinary people to do nothing work harder than you. What other reason do you have for fantasizing about “doing nothing”? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don’t forget, if you really have nothing to do, you will definitely fall into emptiness. If a person does not &quot;fill&quot; his life with meaningful things, he will easily fall into emptiness and become as light as a feather. In this case, even if you get a fortune one day, you will not be able to control such wealth. In Yu Hua&#39;s novel &quot;To Live&quot;, he explained the story of a swinger brother who lost his family fortune by gambling. How many such folk narratives are there? After the demolition in my hometown many years ago, the &quot;second generation&quot; became rich instantly. However, it is not uncommon for them to lose their property overnight due to gambling, dissoluteness, and being cheated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am obviously middle class or even poor, but I still always want to live a &quot;fairy life&quot; like a powerful or wealthy family, just enjoying myself and not working. To put it mildly, this is unrealistic, but to put it seriously, it is unrealistic. This is a lack of self-awareness. This idea is difficult to realize. In short, humans are animals of meaning, and meaning is the food of the spiritual world. On top of establishing a good life, people should do meaningful work or career to nourish our spirit. Under the sun and on the earth, we should still let ourselves &quot;sink&quot;, settle down, and become human plants that are truly not afraid of wind and rain. This principle applies to both the second generation of rich people and the children of ordinary people. Meaningful work or a meaningful career is the &quot;key&quot; that helps a person lead to a happy and transparent state. Only when you find a sense of presence and cultivate your character in your work or career, can you follow the trend. For, gradually improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[取消个人医保账户？国家医保局辟谣]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259436]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 15:04:11&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently, an article titled &quot;Employees Attention! &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;From 2024, employee medical insurance premiums will be completely changed&quot; article and related screenshots were circulated online in some WeChat groups, WeChat Moments and other places.

After the reform, the employee medical insurance personal account system will still be retained, with three &quot;unchanged&quot; features. First, the ownership of personal account balances remains unchanged. The historical balances before the reform and the newly transferred balances after the reform are still owned by the individuals and can be used for medical expenses and other expenses for individuals and their families, and can be carried forward and inherited. Second, the proportion and flow of personal contributions of active employees remain unchanged, and the full amount is still transferred to their personal accounts. Third, the policy of retirees not paying contributions remains unchanged, and personal account funds are still transferred from the overall fund.

This is one of the tasks of my country&#39;s second comprehensive scientific investigation and research on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice cores are like natural archives, recording natural changes and human activities. However, climate change caused by human activities is also erasing the memory in the glaciers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why ice core? Why study glaciers? Who is studying Mount Everest? With various questions, we followed the Everest scientific expedition team in 2023, traced the history of the Everest scientific expedition for more than 60 years since China&#39;s first comprehensive expedition centered on Mount Everest in 1959, and recorded the progress of the glacier scientific expedition. The goals and actions can gradually describe the outline of those engaged in glacier research: most of them come from rural areas, are brave, can endure hardship, love nature, and love field work. They find peace and joy in nature, they are not stingy with time, they are aware of and concerned about the pulse of the earth, and they believe that the world is a community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Shi Yafeng, the father of Chinese glaciers, said, glacier research is a career for brave people and a heroic career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mount Everest is the main peak of the Himalayas, the tallest and youngest mountain range in the world. The Everest region mainly includes the &quot;Everest Nature Reserve&quot; in China on the north slope and the &quot;Sagarmatha National Park&quot; in Nepal on the south slope. With widespread glaciers, it is an important treasure house of freshwater resources on the earth and is also a source of climate and environmental change. Sensitive areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UWRilmxdoeZ2bErRTuZhdK8y4UyVlv1RajRdhTFV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UWRilmxdoeZ2bErRTuZhdK8y4UyVlv1RajRdhTFV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255409&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 23, 2023, members of the scientific expedition team took snow and ice samples at the top of Mount Everest&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ice cores, nuclear explosion tests and pesticides&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;All four drill motors were broken. If it breaks down, just go down the mountain, Chen Pengfei thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of May 20, 2023, at a pass at an altitude of 6,500 meters on Mount Everest, in a military green tent that was blown by the wind, Chen Pengfei and his colleagues shot two Ice core and a shallow ice core. Shallow ice core is an overloaded task: we have worked hard to get there, and we have to drill more until the drill breaks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice cores are cylindrical ice and snow samples that are continuously taken out from the glacier section by section using a drill from top to bottom. A bottom-through ice core means that the ice core is drilled into the rock layer and reaches the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Snowfall falls on glaciers and ice sheets. Year after year, it is deposited into ice, and the information of nature is sealed in it. The scientific expedition team members always want to obtain longer ice cores, hoping that the ice cores will contain more physical and chemical parameters. Relying on these parameters, scientists were able to reconstruct the history of changes over millennia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Antarctica, the North Pole and the Tibetan Plateau are collectively known as the &quot;three poles&quot; of the earth. Human activities in these three poles are weak and are used as the basis for environmental research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We need to know what the earth was originally like.” Chen Pengfei’s colleague Guo Junming said. They are all associate researchers at Northwest China Institute of Technology, which belongs to the State Key Laboratory of Cryosphere Science. This laboratory originated from the Lanzhou Institute of Glaciation and Permafrost, Chinese Academy of Sciences (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;established in 1965&lt;/span>;) and was founded by the &quot;Father of Chinese Glaciers&quot; It was established under the leadership of Shi Yafeng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice cores know the original appearance of the earth. For example, the ratio of stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen reflects the fluctuations in climate, and high values ​​of sulfate ions represent volcanic eruptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice cores also retain evidence of violent human activities, such as nuclear explosion tests and nuclear leaks one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Everest ice core drilled in 2005 was measured to have two beta activation peaks, corresponding to the global thermonuclear test in 1963 and the Chernobyl nuclear leak in 1986. In other words, the memory of the Cold War is sealed in the glacier. In 2017, ice cores drilled in the Aru glacier area at an altitude of 6,150 meters on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were measured with five beta activation peaks of varying levels, which not only correspond to 1963, but also correspond to the 2004 Mihama Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. Steam leaks, the 2005 nuclear leakage accident at the Sellafield Nuclear Power Plant in the UK, the 1968 impact of a US bomber carrying four nuclear bombs and the 1970 explosion of the 10,000-ton underground nuclear device at Jakapin in the US, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/WsbAJ4gjyJziZ2EIlI8fJ57HFd0b5SD0JK4b5QoT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;701&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/WsbAJ4gjyJziZ2EIlI8fJ57HFd0b5SD0JK4b5QoT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255402&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 22, 2023, at the Mount Everest Mountaineering Base Camp, Kang Shichang (right), deputy director of the Northwest Institute of Ecological Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences, viewed a drill drill from an altitude of about 6,500 meters on Mount Everest. Ice core samples taken &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists have found rich records of human activities in the ice cores. The peak lead content in the Greenland ice core drilled in 1994 corresponds to the peak period of the Roman Empire; the black carbon concentration in the East Rongbuk ice core on Mount Everest reflects the continued impact of pollutants emitted by human activities since the Industrial Revolution on the atmospheric environment; more The concentration of DDT in the Everest ice core corresponds to the malaria outbreak in India. DDT is a highly effective but environmentally damaging pesticide that is difficult to decompose. It has been banned by many countries since the late 1990s, but is still used in India. Therefore, the content of DDT in the forest soil of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is currently the highest in the world, higher than Nordic Forest 10 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice core research is difficult to do because the sample size is very small and the appropriate detection indicators are limited. Even if there are good ideas, ice core research is extremely time-consuming and laborious. But ice core research is exactly the direction of Chen Pengfei’s transformation. “At this stage, I need the quality of papers more than the quantity,” he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To ensure that the ice core does not melt, ice core drilling always starts at seven or eight o&#39;clock in the evening and ends before the sun rises. Engineers use exhalation to judge when to start work: if you can exhale &quot;white air&quot;, the temperature is low enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before finishing work at 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, Chen Pengfei always walks out of the tent to watch the sunshine on Jinshan Mountain. The golden light falls from the sky and shines on the snow-capped mountain top. He had seen this scene more than 30 times at the pass, and he was delighted and moved every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How to describe it, starting from the top of the mountain, the golden color slowly falls, and then the entire Mount Everest is golden. It is very spectacular and I like it very much.&quot; Chen Pengfei said.

There are too many places to spend money, and the equipment and consumables in the laboratory are the real gold-swallowing beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for the specially designed drilling rig, the ice cores are surrounded by ordinary objects: ice cores in ordinary plastic bags, marked with black markers; the insulated box is the most common one, dark blue in appearance, one meter in diameter. It is half a meter long and wide, with soft pads inside to protect the ice core from impact; the soft pads are basically cut military green quilts, with red or black mottled cotton batting exposed here and there; as for the freezer, it is a common cold drink cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, it seems that the difficulties Chen Pengfei encounters can be attributed to saving money. On the second day of work, the generator failed to start. It was a non-Yamaha generator. The next day I pulled up the Yamaha generator and worked all night. Closed on the third day, Yamaha was damaged by a rare strong wind. On the fourth day, I borrowed a generator from Everest Base Camp to work, and asked my colleagues to quickly transport another generator. On the fifth day, the tent was completely blown to pieces and the business was closed again. Although the strong wind made people unable to stand steadily, the working tent was just a slightly thicker outdoor tent that had been blown by the wind on the Qilian Bayi Glacier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/sEz01Dwdsa2zl4XMJ4peip4mBeM6yO7jy5wzn99V.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/sEz01Dwdsa2zl4XMJ4peip4mBeM6yO7jy5wzn99V.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255404&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Pengfei&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(our reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don&#39;t shave, Stop shaving.&quot; Chen Pengfei recited silently every night. It wasn&#39;t until the seventh day when new tents and new generators were used that the team members began to work continuously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As everyone in the cryosphere knows, ice coring is hard work. Chen Pengfei’s teacher, Vice President and Researcher of Northwest Institute Kang Shichang wrote in his Antarctic scientific expedition diary: “Compared with the glacier scientific expedition on the Tibetan Plateau, the conditions for the Antarctic ice sheet expedition are much better... The glacier expedition on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, There are only tents, especially in high-altitude areas. They usually use stones to build a stove, use a box to support a chopping board, and cook and cook in a corner of the tent. Sometimes chefs and scientific expedition team members can only sleep in the kitchen tent. Large We don’t have beds for part of the time, so we lie on the ground.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For Everest expeditions, we usually camp on moraine ridges surrounded by rocks. We try to find a few slightly flat stones and lay them with moisture-proof mats. Leather mattress. Every night we are constantly moving and changing sleeping positions, trying to avoid the direct &#39;collision&#39; of sharp rocks and looking for a relatively flat and comfortable position. Sometimes, we also need to camp on the glacier. Once on Mt. During the inspection, I lived for a month on the 6,300-meter-high Rongbuk Glacier in the Far East. When I left, there was a complete human shape printed on the snow surface of the glacier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Shichang participated in the China-U.S. Joint Pearl River Delta Initiative in 1997 The scientific expedition team on Mount Everest drilled the first ice core on Mount Everest; in 2005, he served as the captain of China’s fourth comprehensive scientific expedition team on Mount Everest; in 2013, he led the team to drill 3 ice cores on the East Rongbuk Glacier, including 142 The meter-long one is the longest Everest ice core drilled in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The suffering on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau cannot be compared to the Antarctic.&quot; He said. Almost all work in Antarctica is mechanized, but on the glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau, all work relies on human power, such as shouting slogans to drag dozens of kilograms of ice cores across the ice ridge. Not only must we overcome altitude sickness, we must also do heavy physical work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Creating ice is also a laborious activity. Therefore, in addition to scientists, there are more workers in the team. Most of them have cooperated with Northwest Institute for many years, going to the plateau to climb snow-capped mountains, and walking far away carrying a 100-pound generator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/j9gcOLRvL7U9oBvhhtHO2xip2WHxU3DuARq9qLuk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/j9gcOLRvL7U9oBvhhtHO2xip2WHxU3DuARq9qLuk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255410&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Zhaofu (left)&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(our reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 6500 After working continuously for more than ten days at Mi Chu, everyone felt weak. The strong wind not only damaged the tents and generators, but also made the team members unable to walk every night. &quot;It was obvious that the team members were a little out of control, their tone was a little tough, and they were a little broken.&quot; Chen Pengfei said. Sometimes everyone would sing in the tent, singing loudly without knowing the words or music, which was more like a way to vent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I couldn’t eat or sleep well, and there was strong wind and heavy rain. Everyone has had the experience of getting lost, either using Mani Stones to identify the direction, or relying on teammates&#39; calls to find someone. Everyone has worked on the plateau until they were exhausted. Kang Shichang once chased a frightened yak carrying samples at an altitude of 5,000 meters for samples, until both the yak and he were unable to move due to lack of oxygen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In your subject, will there be more children from rural areas?” We asked Kang Shichang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s absolutely true.&quot; Kang Shichang replied loudly, &quot;Almost all are rural children, and rural children can endure hardship.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The youngest member of Kang Shichang&#39;s team is Hu Zhaofu, 2023 He left his postdoctoral position in 2011 and joined Northwest Institute. He is from Suzhou, Anhui and grew up in a village next to the Lianhuo Expressway. Before going to middle school in the county town, he not only often climbed mountains, but also caught scorpions: he would lift up rocks, and when he found a scorpion, he would hold its tail and blow on it, and then skewer it with chopsticks. Small scorpions are sold for 1 or 2 cents, and larger ones are sold for 40 or 50 cents. Hu Zhaofu, a primary school student, can get more than one yuan of pocket money every time he catches a scorpion. I was stung four or five times, but I didn&#39;t deal with it, saying that the pain would be gone in a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Hu Zhaofu participated in the scientific expedition to the Geladandong Snow Mountain. He worked for 20 days at an altitude of about 5,800 meters, and was able to eat, sleep, and be physically strong. That time he was particularly happy and a little proud. &quot;I see that other people are a little high-reflex, so I feel that my body is capable of doing this job, and God is giving me food.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/10/25/8WI03FcUtgWZ3wQwrIKW9NwgjxT1P60rH0SGtYmo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/8WI03FcUtgWZ3wQwrIKW9NwgjxT1P60rH0SGtYmo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255406&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guo Junming&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Reporter Dashi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The ice tower forest is gradually melting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“The ice tower forest is getting less and less.” Hu Zhaofu said. The first time he climbed Mount Everest was in 2019. In the past four years, the shrinkage of the seracs was visible to the naked eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 5800 and 6300 meters on Mount Everest, the seracs gradually shrink to become sparse and low, making them hard to find at a glance. You have to walk to the mountain col to see them. The seracs look like the teeth of a giant shark and are a form of ice unique to high-altitude areas. Seracs that appear in groups are called seracs. Unlike most seracs that are not as tall as a person, the Everest seracs are scattered in heights, with the tallest ones exceeding 30 meters. Because the seracs on Mount Everest are so tall and resemble a Gothic spire church, Western explorers call them the &quot;Penitentes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seracs are remnants of the melting glaciers. Due to the different movement speeds and ice densities of various parts of the glacier, some cracks and gaps will appear on the surface of the glacier. Mount Everest is located at 27°59&#39; north latitude, which is a low latitude and uneven sunlight exposure. When glaciers melt, the ice in the cracks melts faster, and seracs gradually form. As the temperature rises, the seracs gradually melt and may accumulate into glacial lakes or merge into rivers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Permafrost areas are most sensitive to climate change. The Tibetan Plateau is warming at a rate more than twice the global average, and scientists warn that by 2100, the Tibetan Plateau will lose two-thirds of its glaciers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where is the boundary between man and nature changing each other? Every time he goes out to work in the field, some broad, abstract, and unanswered thoughts will envelope Guo Junming and last until he goes down the mountain. &quot;Human beings are part of the earth. When people adapt to the earth, they will inevitably change the earth. What degree of change is appropriate? The future temperature control value we call is actually the boundary where humans feel comfortable. What about the earth itself? The earth has never experienced such violent activities. Where is the boundary of the earth?&quot; He asked a series of questions and finally concluded, &quot;I sometimes wonder if the earth can be in any state without humans?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are no answers to these questions, but these questions give meaning to Guo Junming’s research. His recent research focus is on the mercury cycle in the cryosphere of the Tibetan Plateau. Human activities cause large amounts of mercury to enter water bodies, atmosphere and soil, and then enter the ecological cycle. Mercury can be detected at all three of Earth&#39;s remote poles. In the 1950s, mercury-containing wastewater was discharged from Minamata Bay in Japan. Fish and shrimp were contaminated, and then entered the bodies of birds, cats, and humans through the food chain. The victims ranged from slurred speech and staggering, to neurological disorders and death. This is the &quot;Minamata Disease Incident in Japan&quot; that shocked the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2017, the Minamata Convention on Mercury came into effect, and so far 128 countries have signed it. In Guo Junming&#39;s view, it was batch after batch of scientific researchers who used research results to clarify the environmental behavior and hazards of mercury, which promoted the birth and signing of the Minamata Convention. He hopes that his research can help all parties understand mercury more fully, and then promote the implementation of the contract by signatory countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Currently, mercury emissions in many countries in Europe and the United States have dropped, but emissions in South Asia are still very large. What I want to study is what impact and how mercury emissions in South Asia have on our Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.&quot; He explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/WU7AmICxijsST7iuLs8uDqokazvx1aj00Q5JnVBx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/WU7AmICxijsST7iuLs8uDqokazvx1aj00Q5JnVBx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255405&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gao Tanguang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(our reporter’s food/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Enjoyed this Such freedom, no longer wanting to do regular work&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The ice cores that were drilled were all buried in the snow. After the ice core penetrated to the bottom, the team members walked back from the pass to the camp at 6,350 meters, packed the boxes until late at night, and waited for the yaks to carry the insulated boxes down the mountain the next day. They then stored them in the base camp freezer and transported them back to Lanzhou by truck. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not two days after returning to Lanzhou from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Guo Junming returned to the office to be busy. He is 36 years old, in his prime academic years, and the breadwinner of his family. Every day he receives a steady stream of phone calls, routine work one after another, and noises he wants to avoid again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice coring is different. There is no signal at 6,300 meters, and Guo Junming’s mobile phone hardly turns on. &quot;It&#39;s so cool not to have a mobile phone, hahaha,&quot; Guo Junming laughed, &quot;I said it a bit harsh, and that&#39;s true. As soon as I got back to the city, I kept calling, emailing, WeChat and all kinds of things. Even if I couldn&#39;t receive them on Mount Everest, I would reply. No, I didn’t do it on purpose, I just couldn’t help it.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He called his home satellite phone every two or three days. In addition, Guo Junming only has three things to do on Mount Everest: eat, sleep and make ice cores. &quot;Creating ice cores with peace of mind.&quot; Guo Junming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having been to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau many times, Guo Junming is now quite proficient in climbing Mount Everest. He knows how far it is to walk from an altitude of 5,300 meters to 6,300 meters. He can always reach it by walking slowly at his own pace and taking his time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tjNJmoO8ystPHYNqgPbyjL9xgC3zDj1wrykNdOPl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tjNJmoO8ystPHYNqgPbyjL9xgC3zDj1wrykNdOPl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255399&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; =&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zou Qiao/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going out into the wild is work, and it is also an adjustment to one&#39;s life. &quot;It&#39;s really depressing to stay in the office for a long time. Go out and see the mountains, lakes, and climb mountains. There will be a few days where you can experience another kind of life, and your mental state will be better after you come back.&quot; Guo Junming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although going out into the field is no longer a necessary condition for geological research, and samples taken by colleagues or partners can also be used for research, in our interviews, everyone participating in the 2023 Mount Everest scientific expedition Scientific researchers all love nature and love going out into the wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Tanguang, associate professor at the School of Resources and Environment of Lanzhou University, offered to take us mountain climbing during the interview. &quot;Let&#39;s change places. It&#39;s a bit silly to sit here (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;café&lt;/span>;),&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who would have thought that the interview would be in Wuquan Mountain, the northern foot of Gaolan Mountain, a natural barrier in Lanzhou city. Not only does Gao Tanguang take his children to climb Wuquan Mountain every Saturday, he even holds group meetings for students by climbing the mountain first and then talking about academics after climbing to the top. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is the senior brother of Chen Pengfei and Guo Junming. He also graduated from the Tibet Institute and studied for a doctorate in Beijing for five years. As a native of Shandong, he worked as a teacher at a key high school in Beijing after graduation and also worked in his hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/GKxiX67cZQvbT3hDKbojRgth2FIx0tQ9ss06yVG7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/GKxiX67cZQvbT3hDKbojRgth2FIx0tQ9ss06yVG7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255398&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 22, 2023, near the Mount Everest Mountaineering Base Camp, scientific expedition team members from the School of Ecology and Environment of Tibet University collected aquatic life samples&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both of these work experiences were very short because they were boring. &quot;When you have experienced the scenery of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for several consecutive years, when field work accounts for a large part of your life, when you have enjoyed the atmosphere of the research group chatting and laughing in the wild, and enjoyed the abundant time to search for something for several days in a row, I have been running around in the mountains, not caring about anything, completely isolated from the outside world. I have enjoyed this kind of freedom, but once I enter a regular job, it is really unbearable.&quot; Gao Tanguang said, &quot;I have always felt that cities are just reinforced concrete. It&#39;s hard to never get out of the forest.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wanted to live freely and live freely. It is difficult to tell whether this is his nature or whether it was shaped by his five years of studying at the Institute of Tibetan Studies. In the past five years, he not only went out in the wild, but also loved to ride mountain bikes in Beijing. He rode from his dormitory to Yanqing, a round trip of more than 100 kilometers. He spent a year as a visiting scholar at the University of Jena, Germany, and traveled through Northern Europe (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;focused on playing in the Arctic Circle&lt;/span>;). He spread out a blanket at the train station and slept, not afraid or alone. &quot;I was in a small town in Norway. I was going to sleep at the train station at night. A group of German college students came in and sat together and took turns reading to everyone. My German is not good, so I couldn&#39;t understand anything I read, but it was so interesting. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tJ3R0BpP98C1XsEeQVFiJopSqi3mArE4kkE7kZYH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960 &quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tJ3R0BpP98C1XsEeQVFiJopSqi3mArE4kkE7kZYH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255401&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 22, 2023, near the Mount Everest climbing base camp, scientific expedition members collected soil samples&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Danger&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Pengfei refuses to miss every sunshine on the Golden Summit, Guo Junming finds peace in making ice cores, and Gao Tanguang is free due to field scientific research. But the romance and charm of glacier scientific research often belong to the lucky and brave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the interview, the name Lin Shubiao was mentioned. In 2011, 29-year-old Lin Shubiao, a doctor from the Institute of Tibetan Studies, disappeared while inspecting the Muztag Glacier in Xinjiang. After completing the installation of the automatic weather station on the Muztag Glacier in Xinjiang, he lost contact while descending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most speculations are that he fell into a deep and winding ice crevice and could not be found by search and rescue. He is a native of Tangkou Natural Village, Zhendong Village, Jiushi City, Zhaoqing City, Guangdong Province. He won the &quot;township top scorer&quot; in the high school entrance examination. He walked out of the mountains in the college entrance examination and was called &quot;the pride of the mountain people&quot; by the villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice crevasses are the biggest danger in glacier scientific research. Most of the time, the crevasses are covered in snow and difficult to see. Kang Shichang once fell into a half-meter-wide ice crevasse. He held his feet on both sides of the crevice, and his body was suspended in the air, waiting for rescue. &quot;I wasn&#39;t afraid at all at that time. The other team members would definitely look for me when they saw that I was missing!&quot; Today, 22 years later, when he talked about this past incident, he suddenly slapped his thigh and said, &quot;Hey! I&#39;m really scared when I think about it now, but I didn’t panic at all at that time! I was so courageous at that time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if they have never fallen into an ice crevasse, everyone can tell a story about a serious case of high fever that they witnessed with their own eyes. Urgent transports down the mountain often encounter dangerous moments: they may get lost halfway and fail to arrive late at night; or they may have become incontinent, and the consequences would be unpredictable if they were slower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, modern glacier scientific research was born along with mountaineering expeditions that represented human courage. Early scientific expeditions to Mount Everest were always closely tied to expeditions to Mount Everest. They also began with human curiosity and desire for unknown territories. Mountaineers not only want to climb Mount Everest, but also get back precious basic information, such as images or samples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The first expedition made very valuable geological surveys, and both expeditions also observed and collected many geological and botanical specimens. The geologists wanted a stone from the summit of Mount Everest , so that you can determine whether the peak is at the top or bottom of the fold.&quot; In 1922, Mallory, the British explorer who first attempted to climb Mount Everest, introduced the scientific gains of climbing Mount Everest twice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time China organized scientific researchers to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the 7,000 square kilometers centered on Mount Everest was in 1959, in order to cooperate with the national mountaineering team in preparing for the first climb of Mount Everest. The first modern glacier scientific expedition in China was just two years ago, in 1957. At that time, regarding the activities organized by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to climb Mount Gongga, He Long, then director of the National Sports Commission, instructed: Mountain climbing should serve scientific research and expand social effects. Three scientific workers were selected to climb Mount Gongga: Cui Zhijiu, Ma Wenfu and Ding Xingyou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;That&#39;s a hero! Our hero in the glacier world!&quot; In a chat, someone mentioned Cui Zhijiu. Kang Shichang gave a thumbs up and said in a loud voice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Zhijiu’s glacier career began in 1957 when he climbed Mount Gongga. The following year, he published &quot;Preliminary Observation of Modern Glaciers in the Gongga Mountains&quot;, filling the gap in the study of modern glaciers in China. The subtitle of this paper is: &quot;In memory of the comrades who died heroically in the conquest of Gongga Mountain.&quot; In Gongga Mountain, four team members encountered mountain disasters, including scientific worker Ding Xingyou, who was an assistant professor in the Meteorology Department of Beijing Agricultural University at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next 10 years, Cui Zhijiu visited the Everest region twice and climbed Nyenchen Tanglha, Muztagh and Shishapangma. He lost five fingers from the cold, suffered from severe snow blindness, and experienced the sacrifices of 12 teammates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that such tragic stories have rarely been seen in glacier scientific expeditions in the past 30 years, but what the older generation of scientists experienced and persevered still has lasting power for those who come after them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Tan Guangzheng, who was born in the 1980s, read &quot;Qinghai Tibet: 50 Years of Scientific Investigation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Published by Sanlian Bookstore in 1999), I have been fascinated by the Qinghai-Tibet scientific research since college. He also loves to read &quot;National Geographic&quot; and goes to the old market every month to buy back issues with their covers torn off. &quot;It&#39;s said to be a back issue, but it&#39;s actually only one month away. It only costs 3 yuan a copy. Hahahaha, for only 3 yuan, you can own a copy of last month&#39;s National Geographic.&quot; He learned from National Geographic&#39;s I learned about the Qinghai-Tibet Institute and Kang Shichang in the special episode of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and later became a disciple of Kang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/HfsJGXoMZdcG0Vr9R6cVG4oSNNbTt0HNaEXptuvu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/HfsJGXoMZdcG0Vr9R6cVG4oSNNbTt0HNaEXptuvu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255403&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 10, 2023, at the Everest Atmospheric and Environmental Comprehensive Observation and Research Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, scientific expedition members used scientific instruments to collect greenhouse gases in the air&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Vast Tibet&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, it seems that due to the update of scientific research results, &quot;The Vast Tibet&quot; is no longer a good book. popular science readings, but the hundreds of people mentioned in detail or in detail still exude the charisma of passing on scientific research from generation to generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1968, glaciologist Xie Zichu signed up to participate in the scientific expedition to Mount Everest. He returned home with a full load. As soon as he got off the train, he was dragged into a fight and locked up in a cowshed that night. He was criticized for three years, but he quietly compiled the investigation data in the bullpen and completed a thesis on the ice-forming effect of infiltration on Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 1972, the Qinghai-Tibet Scientific Expedition Team was established. Many experts who had lost their jobs and had been working in the &quot;May 7th Cadre School&quot; all year round told each other that they called it a &quot;safe haven&quot;. Through this scientific expedition team, our country began to establish an understanding of the Tibetan Plateau from different subject dimensions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from the 1950s, the main achievements of the 30-year first phase of modern glaciology in China were the completion of regional and national filling of snow, ice, and frozen soil. This basic work means long and arduous field expeditions and a lifelong dedication of a group in particularly harsh conditions: the starting point of the work of glaciologists is where the snow line lies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the snowy swamp area, the car was stuck and dug repeatedly, and on the extremely cold night when the wind and snow overturned the tent, you would feel the burden on the lungs and heart every step you took, and for those with severe mountain sickness, emergency rescue, the joy of surviving a desperate situation, the fragility and magnificence of life that can be experienced in the snowy mountains and ice fields, as well as the relief and countless emotions at the end of each expedition... After every danger is saved, they will always I was overjoyed: &#39;It was so dangerous!&#39; After every field trip, I couldn&#39;t help but sigh with regret. But when I went out to the field again the next year, I was brave enough to move forward courageously. Choosing this career also meant accepting it. Everything related to it.&quot; There is such a passage in &quot;Qinghai-Tibet Vast&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;The Vast Tibet&quot;, in 1980, when the International Scientific Symposium on the Tibetan Plateau was held, Deng Xiaoping smiled loudly and replied in Sichuan dialect: &quot;We in China have With so many mountains, it doesn’t matter if you take away a few stones. They can take them if they want.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, international exchanges and cooperation in Tibetan Plateau research have become routine work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My mentor is very far-sighted.” Kang Shichang talked about academician Qin Dahe, the first Chinese to cross the Antarctic continent on foot and the author of the assessment report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When my supervisor trains students, he must first be international. When I was studying for a Ph.D., he asked me to study abroad several times, and my postdoctoral work was also done in the United States.&quot; Kang Shichang was a little emotional, &quot;When I was in After traveling around the world, I realized that there are differences in culture and good and bad politicians, but people are very amiable. Many times, group interests and political interests lead to many conflicts on our planet. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because the subject research he is engaged in is always related to the changes of the entire earth. In Kang Shichang’s eyes, the earth is the dust of the universe, and human beings are the dust of the earth. Disputes and conflicts are inevitable in the face of the vast universe. Lost meaning. &quot;Global warming is not caused by any country, but by all mankind.

Here, the scientific expedition team members can use the power supply from the national grid, sleep in bed with air conditioning, and use the toilet normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its completion in 2005, in the past 18 years, the Everest Station has evolved from a tent to a prefabricated house to a building, and its observation and monitoring instruments have gradually been completed. After Xi Zhenhua came to the Everest Station, he added several people as helpers to perform data collection on different scientific research tasks, such as regularly monitoring the hydrology of the Rongbuk River, observing the growth of alpine shrubs, and guarding against local plum blossoms being eaten by plateau sheep, instrument The battery was stolen. During the peak season of the scientific expedition, he helped the scientific expedition team communicate with the locals, arrange food and accommodation, and deal with various practical problems, such as driving injured workers to the hospital in Shigatse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, in order to prove that he could stay at the Mount Everest station, Xi Zhenhua stayed on the mountain for more than half a year for the first time. He had diarrhea as soon as he drank water and lost more than 20 pounds. It was not until he spent the New Year at the village cadre&#39;s house that he learned that boiling water in a pressure cooker could cure his acclimatization. &quot;Now it doesn&#39;t matter whether I use a pressure cooker or not. I just get used to it as I drink,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Zhenhua is already half a local. On the way up the mountain with him, he chatted enthusiastically with his &quot;three brothers and three sisters-in-law&quot; and regretted that he missed the horse racing festival. There are two boys from the nearby Basong Village who often come to play basketball in front of the Everest Station. Xi Zhenhua watches with gusto. He went to a Tibetan home to celebrate the Tibetan New Year, where he ate steamed vegetables, drank wine, sang, danced and played dice. After the round, he came back to eat, drink and sing. He also collects donations of clothes from his circle of friends and distributes them to villagers with financial difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is not good at sociability, but he has become familiar with the locals because of his time. &quot;Over the past few years, they have become familiar with this place. Maybe they think that I am very honest and I will not treat them badly, so they are very willing to help me with many things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This place was only opened in 2016 When the power was turned on, the violent storm cracked the window glass. Peppers, potatoes, leeks and rapeseed are grown in the vegetable greenhouse. During the meal, eight people share a plate of scrambled eggs with leeks. The weather is getting colder, and I shiver with cold every time I go down the river to measure data; when going up or down the mountain in the middle of the night, there are frequent rockfalls, and swarms of moths and lime hit the windshield. Every time I go forward, it is like breaking through the fog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once upon a time, Xi Zhenhua’s closest friend was a native dog named Dahuang, who had been there since he entered the station. Every time he returned to the station in the middle of the night, Dahuang would lie at the door waiting for him, and would rush at anyone he saw. Wags the tail forward. &quot;Last year, before I got on the plane, I found out that Dahuang was dead. I couldn&#39;t stop crying all the way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a secular sense, Xi Zhenhua has many disappointments. But after seeing mountains and rocks for months and years, he forgot about that. &quot;Sometimes you can live very easily if you don&#39;t think about the messy things. Day by day passes like this, very fast.&quot; Xi Zhenhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is not stingy with time, has few desires, and is somewhat insensitive. Staying at the Mount Everest station for 10 years is not painful for Xi Zhenhua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He loves to pick up stones and relies on his imagination to select stones: like a lady dancing, like a white tiger lying prone, like a Tibetan antelope leaping. When I was most lonely, stones were piled up on the wall behind the Everest station. He doesn&#39;t smoke and doesn&#39;t drink much, so he passes the time by recreating stone textures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Zhenhua’s real pain is his relationship with his daughter. He spends little time with his family and knows that his children have a weak relationship with him. Sometimes the video only hangs up after saying two or three sentences. &quot;We will face this kind of problem in the wild for a long time. It is always a problem and there is nothing we can do about it,&quot; he sighed. Every time he thought about this, he felt a little regretful about coming to the Everest Station. &quot;I want to stay with my wife at home.&quot; Children.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After coming down from the mountain in 2023, Xi Zhenhua went to his daughter&#39;s school to participate in the &quot;Parents in the Classroom&quot; activity. He told the primary school students about the origin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, his work on the station and interesting stories. The daughter was very happy that day and thought her father had done a good job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At least I can gain some status in the children&#39;s hearts.&quot; Xi Zhenhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking from the open space in front of the Everest Station, if the sky is clear, you can see a small section of the Golden Summit at sunset. Sometimes there are colorful auspicious clouds, so colorful that they have the gentle power to soothe people&#39;s hearts. In the middle of the night, I looked up and saw the starry sky, with the Milky Way brushing across the night like a brush. Many steep unknown mountains have names in Xi Zhenhua&#39;s mouth: This one has a lion&#39;s face, that one has a horse&#39;s body. His favorite saying is: Compared with Mount Everest, these are nothing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/ZQxbMx6X9tJPsw9g9DNDvqUFfmpHNtIZ1Mqdr3fi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/ZQxbMx6X9tJPsw9g9DNDvqUFfmpHNtIZ1Mqdr3fi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;British explorer Mallory&#39;s photo spot&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zou Qiao/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cross Two photos from the year 102&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before reaching 6,500 meters in 2023, the scientific expedition team will stay at the base camp for many days to complete glacier end sampling, glacier lake measurement, and an idea of ​​​​slanting out: find Here’s another photo of the location of the Rongbuk Glacier in Mallory’s 1921 photo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest existing image of the Everest glacier was taken by British explorer Mallory. Mallory once said a famous sentence in the history of mountaineering - when someone asked him why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, he replied succinctly:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Because the mountain is there.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;The dream of climbing Mount Everest has attracted the British elite for many years. Veteran and mountaineer Mallory was selected by the British Mountaineering Club to become the hope of seizing the afterglow of the once &quot;empire on which the sun never sets&quot; after entering the 20th century. Since the second half of the 19th century, British exploration has ceased to lead. They repeatedly failed in the race to open the Northwest Passage and reach the North and South Poles of the Earth. After the end of World War I, Mount Everest, known as the &quot;Third Pole&quot;, became Britain&#39;s last hope to prove itself. Many newspapers in the UK published a speech by Younghusband, chairman of the Royal Geographical Society - better known as a colonist who led troops to invade Tibet in 1903-1904 and killed many people - saying that he was the first to stand on Everest. Those at the top will inspire countless comers and cheer up the whole country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mallory climbed Mount Everest with the team in 1921 and 1922. The first time he reached an altitude of 7,000 meters, he photographed the Zhongrongbuk Glacier; the second time he reached an altitude of 8,320 meters, with 7 people on the way. Sherpa killed by avalanche. His teammates found a trail leading up through the East Rongbuk Glacier: a rise of dirt and rock right in the middle of the glacier that made it possible to hike directly across the glacier. Since then, climbers and scientific expedition team members of all generations have walked through this road to reach the 6,500-meter mark of Mount Everest. Western explorers call it the &quot;Miracle Highway&quot;, and Chen Pengfei said they call it the &quot;Yak Trail&quot;: This is the last section of Mount Everest that yaks can pass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1924, Mallory climbed Mount Everest for the third time. This time he had a young partner, Andrew Owen, a student from Oxford University. On the morning of June 8, the two set off from 8,300 meters with new oxygen equipment, and then disappeared on Mount Everest. It was not until 1999 that an American mountaineering team sponsored by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) discovered Mallory&#39;s body at about 8,170 meters on the north slope of Mount Everest, but there is still no trace of Owen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether the two men had ever reached the summit during their lifetimes has become one of the most famous mysteries in the history of modern mountaineering. The climbing team did not find a photo of Mallory&#39;s wife in Mallory&#39;s well-preserved belongings. He once promised that if he reached the summit, he would leave a photo of his wife on Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Rongbuk Glacier photographed by Mallory is a photo familiar to permafrost researchers. Kang Shichang even used this photo as the cover of a course teaching the changes in Mount Everest glaciers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finding Mallory’s shooting spot was Gao Danguang’s task, and he was quite excited about it. Mallory was his favorite explorer: full of grit, heroic tragedy, and unsolved mysteries. He initially did not know that the 1921 photo of Zhongrongbu Glacier was taken by Mallory and that it had appeared in his study materials. When he learned that the photographer was Mallory, a sense of intimacy came over him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many years ago you read bits and pieces about someone, and then suddenly discovered that you had already met him in your work, and it was like the intimacy of meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign country. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glaciers are changing all the time: accumulation and melting constitute the material balance of ice and snow. Climate change can tip this balance off at any time, causing glaciers to advance or retreat. Therefore, scientists always want to obtain as much data as possible on changes in glaciers over time to study the changing processes of glaciers and climate. Although glacier monitoring in the Himalayas has made rapid progress in the past 20 years with the help of satellite remote sensing technology, long-term continuous observations are still lacking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we can take another picture of the Zhongrongbuk Glacier at the Mallory shooting point, it will move the time scale of observing glacier changes forward by 102 years. This is the scientific significance of finding Mallory&#39;s shooting spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gaotanguang failed three times, for different reasons: unable to cross the moraine on the west side of the Rongbuk Glacier; there was a problem with the instrument; the shooting point was found but was blocked by clouds and fog. Finally, his junior brother Wang Shaoyong and an accompanying reporter took a picture of the Zhongrongbu Glacier in 2023 at the Mallory shooting point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the first glacier distribution map of the Mount Everest region drawn by the British mountaineering team in 1921, Gao Tanguang compared the two photos spanning 102 years and was surprised to find that the distribution of the Rongbuk Glacier in mid-1921 The seracs are about 4 kilometers below the current terminal seracs, and the huge glacial lake at the end of the glacier today did not exist back then. This means that as the global climate continues to warm, the end of the Zhongrongbuk Glacier is retreating by an average of 40 meters per year, and the retreat rate is increasing year by year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, the end of the Halong Glacier in the Animaqing Mountains in the Yellow River source area has retreated by 450 meters in the 11 years from 2006 to 2017, while the Gangjiaquba located in the east of Geladandang, the source of the Yangtze River The glacier has retreated more than 4 kilometers since 1969. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SGCzy0HK8bSTD86oxanq9IR03P3EWHWGGyFL5Yvq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SGCzy0HK8bSTD86oxanq9IR03P3EWHWGGyFL5Yvq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255408&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At about 12:30 on May 23, 2023, the 13 summit members of the 2023 Everest Scientific Expedition successfully climbed to the top of Mount Everest, the top of the earth. After that, they will complete important scientific research tasks such as collecting snow and ice samples from the peak&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The memory of the disappearing glaciers&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;At this time, one day in October 2023, Chen Pengfei went to the Geladandong Peak of Tanggula Mountain to take ice cores again. On the way to the foot of the mountain, the falling snow enveloped the surroundings in a white mist. The spray-like snow blown off from the snow-capped mountains looks like endless white scarves against the blue sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 40 centimeters of snow in Gradandong delayed Chen Pengfei’s work progress: every step seemed to be opening a path. &quot;I thought I could move everything in two days, but now it seems it will take five or six days.&quot; When he thought he would lose the signal, he shared a photo of the snow with us. It was a vast area. &quot;Under the snow are stones and straw bags. , It’s easy to sprain your feet and you have to return to the tent before dark. If you are too tired from walking, the team members will collapse easily.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time Kang Shichang’s team took ice cores from Gradandong was in 2005. Chen Pengfei This time we walked higher than 18 years ago: the higher the altitude, the less likely it is for the glacier to melt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2005 Gradandong ice core was cut into more than 3,000 small pieces. Zhang Qianggong, a researcher at the Tibet Institute, tried to date it by testing indicators related to nuclear explosions - this is the most mature method for dating ice cores. one. But it took him two years to locate the peak of tritium activity in the 1960s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We expected that the peak should appear at about 20 meters, but in fact it appeared at 5 meters. In another ice core from Nyenchen Tanglha Mountain, we did not find a corresponding nuclear explosion Value, this has caused us a lot of trouble, what is the problem?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, Zhang Qianggong brought the ice core to the Paul Hill Institute in Switzerland. &quot;This is the world&#39;s largest nuclear energy and chemical laboratory. The research finally determined that the top of the Gladandong ice core corresponds to 1982, but this ice core was drilled in 2005, and the top should correspond to 2005. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In other words, the records of the Gradandong ice core from 1982 to 2005 are missing. The information loss of the Nyenchen Tanglha ice core is even greater. The records only stop at 1950. Ten years of memories have disappeared.&quot; Zhang Qianggong shared this research experience in a speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Global warming is melting the ice. Research by two generations of scientists has confirmed that human activities are causing rising temperatures. Based on the six climate change policies issued by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as IPCC&lt;/span>;) from 1990 to 2003) Take the first assessment report as an example. The 1990 report stated that “there is very little observational evidence to detect the impact of human activities on climate.” By 2007, the report stated that “global warming since the mid-20th century is likely to be caused by human activities.” By 2023, the IPCC is very convinced that &quot;there is no doubt that human activities have caused warming of the atmosphere, oceans and land.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glaciers remember human activities, but human activities are also erasing glaciers memory. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Fairness&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As temperatures rise and glaciers melt, the consequences are of course not only the disappearance of serac forests, but more importantly, the occurrence of avalanches, floods, and the reduction of fresh water resources. There are an increasing number of large glacial lakes in the Himalayas that could burst their banks at any time and destroy high mountain communities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Global warming is not only about the environment, but also about fairness. The most vulnerable people and ecosystems are disproportionately affected by loss and damage and are suffering a disproportionate share of the adverse impacts of climate change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2006, the village of Harji in western Nepal has been hit by glacial lake floods every summer. Floods and reverse currents flew down from the glacial lake on Namunani Peak at 5,300 meters in the western Himalayas, sweeping away houses, horses and crops; in 2012, an avalanche in the Himalayas caused river flooding and killed more than 70 Nepalis; In 2016, the Nepalese military spent several months dredging Lake Imza, the glacial lake on Mount Everest. In 2018, scientists warned that climate warming will cause the glaciers in the Himalayas to melt at an alarming rate, and Lake Imza may continue to expand. Eventually it collapses, possibly causing horrific floods in Nepal. Rishi Ram Sharma, director of the Nepal Hydrological Meteorological Service, said: &quot;As a small country, it is difficult for us to prevent what happens to the glacier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, the IPCC&#39;s Sixth Assessment &quot;Synthesis Report&quot; stated , almost half of the world’s population lives in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Over the past decade, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15 times higher in highly vulnerable areas than in low vulnerability areas. “Taking the right actions now will bring about fundamental changes that are crucial to building a sustainable and equitable world.” IPCC emphasized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 1961 to 2016, the Tibetan Plateau lost more than 43 billion tons of ice, but this is less than one percent of the global ice retreat. The global ice volume has lost more than 9 trillion tons in 55 years. In the 1990s, about 0.8 trillion tons of ice melted every year. From 2000 to 2017, the annual ice melt volume was about 1.3 trillion tons. In simple calculation, 1 trillion tons of ice is a large ice block with a length, width and height of 10 kilometers, which is higher than Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Now is the warmest time in the past two thousand years. Recovery is a very slow process. I can&#39;t imagine how to cool the earth and restore the seracs. You won&#39;t be able to see this by the end of this century. &quot;Arrived.&quot; Kang Shichang said, &quot;The amount of water released by the glacier ice sheet causes the sea level to rise by 3 millimeters per year. If the global sea level rises by 15 meters, it is equivalent to the demise of the Greenland ice sheet. Then the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, The Pearl River Delta will be in catastrophe.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists have made many early warnings, but the power of change often does not belong to them. IPCC Chairman Li Huisheng told government representatives around the world during discussions at the 2023 conference: “Mainstreaming effective and equitable climate action will not only reduce loss and damage to nature and people, but also bring wider benefits. If we take action now, we can still provide a livable and sustainable future for everyone.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time we take ice cores, the team always asks some Tibetans to help, 24-year-old Dundang Also among them. He is from Quzong Village, one of the villages closest to Everest Base Camp. Everest tourism, Everest scientific expeditions and commercial mountaineering have brought new livelihoods to the people of Quzong Village. Dundang said, &quot;Here, Everest is our greatest resource.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What do you think of Mount Everest?&quot; Has the peak changed?&quot; a reporter asked him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mount Everest has not changed, it is still the majestic Mount Everest.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Do you want to leave?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No, we are here There is a relationship between people and Mount Everest.&quot; He gestured a thumbs up to the camera and said with a smile, &quot;Welcome to come back next year!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Thanks to the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environmental Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences and He Peiyun for their help with this interview.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[科幻作家糖匪：被AI替代的人如何生活？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259000]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/o4Pd43WOaAdR06Ey8U48hjSWoGqg6aRVdO7dPqZ8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/o4Pd43WOaAdR06Ey8U48hjSWoG qg6aRVdO7dPqZ8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254468&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;An electronic zoo in an urban apartment&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;How do you think about killing a person in a place with complete surveillance?&quot; Intermittent voices came from the phone. . In the early autumn of 2023, in a cafe on the streets of Shanghai, science fiction writer Tang Bandit talked about the original idea of ​​the new novel collection &quot;Later Humanity&quot; in a telephone interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, when it was difficult to travel freely due to the fluctuations of the new crown epidemic, Sugar Bandit began to re-examine the house where he lived. At that time, she lived in an old house in downtown Beijing. The house was small and the study was filled with books. Sugar bandits prefer this kind of tranquility amidst the hustle and bustle of urban life. Although many friends have equipped their homes with a complete set of voice-controlled smart appliances, there are not many smart appliances in her home. Sugar Bandit lives alone, and the only camera installed in his home is to take care of his dog, which has been with him for 18 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you look at your home again, you will feel a sense of alienation: a house is like a building block that makes up a city. People live in it and use their mobile phones to pull a series of smart appliances in the house—— They are electronic creatures in the technological age, listening to their master&#39;s call. When smart appliances are domesticated enough to be intelligent, will they protect their owners and families like pets? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science fiction writing is the prism through which Sugar Bandit observes the world. Winner of the Hugo Award and Nebula Award, Chinese-American science fiction writer Yukun Liu translated Sugar Bandit&#39;s first science fiction novel &quot;Dirty Stories&quot;. When he saw Sugar Bandit, he felt that she was just like the stories she wrote, not bound by conventions. , do not write fast food dessert literature for sales. In the science fiction collections &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Saw Cetus&quot;, the sugar bandit is obsessed with traveling through cities, illusions and the universe. &quot;Whether it&#39;s aliens or time travel, whether it&#39;s urban horror or virtual reality technology, Sugar Bandit&#39;s novels are good at using these common metaphors in science fiction to express and question our insights as human beings.&quot; In Liu Yukun&#39;s view, this is exactly what Characteristics of the science fiction world, &quot;Reality is more science fiction than fiction, and science fiction thinking has become a way to tell the truth.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The future has arrived, but it&#39;s just not popular yet.&quot; Although Kevin Kelly has already stated in &quot; &quot;Inevitable&quot; reminds people of their attitude towards technology, but when AlphaGo and ChatGPT arouse social attention, it is still difficult for people to regard artificial intelligence as the current reality. Instead, they either imagine the broad future opened by technology, or continue to maintain this alert. Sugar Bandit is a technology enthusiast who is keen on researching new technologies. However, in her collection of science fiction novels &quot;Later Humanity&quot;, she has set her sights on the &quot;posthumanity&quot; left behind by the technological era. She writes about those Ordinary people who have disappeared from society unknowingly use science fiction to re-describe the lives of those abandoned by the times, revealing the profound changes that technology has had on people&#39;s lifestyles and interpersonal communication patterns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sugar Bandit’s novel, the future has arrived and mankind has entered the era of comprehensive artificial intelligence. However, people still have memories of their past lives. Half of them have entered the clean future in the cloud, and the other half of themselves have entered the era of comprehensive artificial intelligence. The memory of the body stuck in the ground. In the cyber world where humans and machines are coupled, people have virtual clones uploaded to the cloud, brain-computer assembly surgeries to enhance brain power, artificial intelligence &quot;family masters&quot; that control everything in their apartments, and machines that satisfy the sexual desires of family members. &quot;Happy&quot;, people can also rent out their bodies in the spherical vibrator field... The sugar bandit describes the later human beings with delicate brushstrokes: He Lai who disappeared with his memory, Xin Min, the housewife who was monitored by the &quot;family mastermind&quot;, &quot; Chen Keqing, a beauty blogger who has a stable mentality and is like a plastic person...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;These stories tell the most common daily things of human beings, but they write about Zhang Ailing-like feelings in the technological age and touch the softest of human beings.&quot; and the hardest parts, I have never seen science fiction express them in such a detailed, lingering and heart-wrenching way.&quot; Science fiction writer Han Song said that he feels that such science fiction novels are real literature that belongs to the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Happy Days,&quot; Sugar Bandit imagines a new kind of apartment in the future. In the future, people will no longer worry about mortgages and rents. The housing problem that once strained the entire society has long since dissipated. The right to residence is people’s birthright. “The younger generation has forgotten that era of housing tension. Due to the climate Conditions shortened the durability of a large number of buildings, living resources were highly concentrated, and housing supply was once very tight. Even if the last generation of baby boomers has passed and the urban population has dropped sharply, the habitable land area still cannot satisfy the existing population. The emergence of new apartments has ended that period Chaotic and crowded days.&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Happy Days&quot;&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, intensive and intelligent Smart apartments are given temperature by technology, and the temperature is passed on to those who choose it in the future.

Technology provides a happy, efficient, and convenient life for the people who live here, and it also controls and monitors everything in these homes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in these families, who is qualified to control the machines? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/WtMDY37206Cqnz5LHmqwUUSwMS9JIHXl40wpwm6V.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/WtMDY37206Cqnz5LHmqwUUSwMS9JIHXl40wpwm6V.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254470&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At the event site of the 4th Another Planet Science Fiction Conference, from left, Liu Cixin, Sugar Bandit, Han Song&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewed (Photo courtesy of author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Man and machine, are they enemies or friends? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Novelist Liao Jing felt a little horrified when she read &quot;Happy Days&quot; by Sugar Bandit.

In the novel, the &quot;family master&quot; of the apartment is omniscient. &quot;It appears as a server, knows everything, and takes care of the couple in every possible and subtle way, but in fact it is a monitor.&quot; , and even became a ruler.&quot; Liao Jing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Actually, in the past few years, everyone has often felt this way. It&#39;s like I spent money to buy a mobile phone, and after downloading some software, I put a chain on myself.&quot; Liao Jing shared his feelings at the Sugar Bandit&#39;s new book salon, &quot;We feel that we are the owners of the mobile phone, and that the mobile phone is about me, but if I forget to bring my mobile phone when I go out, I may not be able to go anywhere. When you think technology When you are cared for and taken care of all the time, you are actually trapped in some kind of shackles.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the penetration of technology in the digital age, people&#39;s sense of being monitored seems to be everywhere. When writing &quot;Happy Days&quot;, Sugar Bandit was curious that if people lose their initiative in the apartment where they live every day, then whether this apartment where people are taken care of in every possible way is more like the &quot;French philosopher Michel Foucault&quot; proposed &quot;Panopticon&quot;, can technology really empower the disadvantaged, or will it intensify exploitation and accelerate differentiation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the novel, even in the technological future where people can upload all their memories and ways of thinking to the cloud, families living in future apartments will still have a family model of &quot;the man is the head of the house and the woman is the head of the house&quot;. This comes from sugar. The bandit&#39;s special setting. The wife does housework at home. By arranging the &quot;domestic mastermind&quot;, the wife controls all matters in the home and appears to be the master of the home. However, the control authority of the &quot;family mastermind&quot; lies in the hands of the husband. Even if he just adjusts the electrical parameters in the home, he needs to wait for his permission after he comes home from get off work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Although it is a story that takes place in the future, the actual reading experience is very contemporary. As a housewife’s situation that we often talk about, it has also appeared in many movies and TV series. She is in her Her status in family life is even lower than that of the &#39;brain&#39; of the apartment. She has always been in an environment of being controlled and monitored. Although she seems to be the master and has constant needs, in fact she does not even have the authority to modify the parameters. She would not get this permission.&quot; Liao Jing said, &quot;She was thinking, what do I need AI for? To enable me to be more proactive and better at completing housework. The question raised actually involves a core issue, which is who is it? Who is taking advantage of whom is enslaving whom.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the technological leaps one after another, what is seen is technological progress, what is not seen is the hidden labor. In the novel, Sugar Bandit specifically depicts the relationship between this woman and the family AI: at home, the person who understands her best and gives her the most time to spend with her is the &quot;family mastermind&quot; AI that she has trained with her own hands. Her job is also to use human experience and emotions to &quot;feed&quot; AI, type it into text and input it into the AI ​​backend, so that AI can better serve humans. Faced with the ubiquitous family boss in the smart apartment, her cheating husband who turned a blind eye to her, and the sudden death of her best friend, the protagonist Xin Min fell into a fear of losing her subjectivity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of sugar bandits, the most cruel punishment is &quot;the disappearance of a person.&quot; &quot;Lock a person in a small space and pretend she doesn&#39;t exist. You seem to be free in this society, but you are made transparent. No one cares about what you think or what you like, and the occasional conversation with you is It all revolves around his needs. Your labor is small because it is covered by technology, and personal value cannot be realized through intellectual labor. Domestic labor does not count as labor, and your emotional labor is also exploited. In this case, this The heroine is the person who &#39;disappeared&#39; and does not exist.&quot; Sugar Bandit said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Science fiction is a way of thinking that saves us from our daily stereotypes and inherent thinking through extreme situations, the construction of different worlds, and other unfamiliar creative methods. Come out. So as to change the scale and angle of how we look at problems, and re-examine our current lives.&quot; In the master class of the 7th China-Europe International Literature Festival, Sugar Bandit pointed out when she was invited to share her knowledge and understanding of science fiction novels The significance of science fiction is not just to create spectacles that are different from reality. The key is to break away from ordinary perspectives and thinking. This imagination is rooted in the heavy reality and gains the power to grow upward from the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The setting of the machine in the novel is different from previous novels. When the &quot;family mastermind&quot; faces this seemingly inseparable couple, its only need is to maintain the stability of the family. It quietly helps the couple cover up traces of each other&#39;s derailments and protect the existing family&#39;s orbit. Like a parent, he wants this to happen. The home runs well. The desire of women in the novel is also to restore order, but they are not satisfied with the beautiful order restored by machines, but hope to obtain their own subjectivity. In the extreme setting of the novel, she kills her husband and disposes of the criminal tools through the smart apartment, and in the end the &quot;family mastermind&quot; also helps cover up the crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It is not so much about revenge, but about her finding a way to exist as a living person after her own human value has been erased. This is not an opposition between men and women, but a social structure problem.&quot; Sugar Bandit said that the novel transfers people&#39;s helplessness and indignation towards the world into personal plight. Breaking free from it and breaking through it are actually a matter of personal confrontation with the plight of the entire world. With the help of the machine, the woman gains freedom and her true identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How will the relationship between humans and machines change in the future? In the view of the sugar bandit, people today no longer treat technology like the confrontation or blind worship they had in the early 21st century. In the future, people may stand together with machines to fight against the so-called &quot;inhumanity&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/NQwtjJ1QnbZJt7xvxWizVueWRn7FuM6aITaSoEru.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/NQwtjJ1QnbZJt7xvxWizVueWRn7FuM6aITaSoEru.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254473&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot; Later people&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The sugar bandit is in poor health and had a major operation in 2022. &quot;My condition this year is worse than last year. I have been sleeping only two to three hours a day for a long time. And in When I was in Beijing, I couldn’t go out. My whole person was in a shaky state.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the disease came, Sugar Bandit felt that he had finally entered an excellent writing state. Several novellas have been written. Different from previous novel collections, she has developed a very complete and systematic world in the new novel collection. She feels that she has found a very clear writing direction and has a very clear understanding of science fiction. Concept, can&#39;t wait to enter a new stage of creation, &quot;At that time, if you gave me an apple, I could write science fiction novels. That state was very stable and very wild, and I felt like I could do anything.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; &quot;The result was all of a sudden. I went to the hospital for a check-up and found out all of a sudden... Then I started to be rubbed by death for two years.&quot; Sugar Bandit recalled the medical treatment at that time in the noisy cafe, about her going to the hospital during the epidemic. Surgery in the hospital is difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology is always improving, and people tend to move forward with time and are good at forgetting. The English title of the new collection of novels &quot;After Humanity&quot; has two translations. The first one is &quot;posthumanity&quot;, which is a very important concept in science fiction novels. The second is to use Shanghai dialect to say that &quot;latecomers&quot; are those who are left behind. &quot;Those who arrive first will become more successful and resourceful people. Those who come later will obviously be more passive and will slowly and unknowingly slide into a marginal position. The future in the novel is very pessimistic.&quot; Sugar Bandit Said, &quot;The novel is the best mirror for the author, and the understanding of the world is presented in the text in a very honest and undisguised way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sugar Bandit&#39;s view, science fiction is not just about carrying science and technology A fanciful literary type, she loves science fiction because it is so lively and full of possibilities. In ancient China, novels developed from myths and legends to fantasy novels. The authors presented these fictional objects to readers with a naive and enthusiastic belief. Although technology has long dispelled the darkness of human pre-modern civilization, reality and fantasy have been confused again in another form. Especially in the years of the COVID-19 epidemic, shock has become the norm. Many incredible things happen, and people use science fiction to describe reality, whether it is a dream life given by highly developed technology or a nightmare reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When people are already living in science fiction, how should science fiction literature express and respond to reality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the writing of &quot;Later Humanity&quot;, Sugar Bandit felt that this process was a &quot;flying close to the ground&quot;, and several novels imagined future cities along the lines of real life. &quot;Such science fiction gives Will the huge sense of surprise make men feel excited? Not necessarily, but I want to be a little provocative and stinging, making people understand that even if technology is so advanced, family work still requires a huge amount of labor, patience and time. . Not only family labor, but also in modern life due to the emergence of technology, many labors have been covered up due to the advancement of technology.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People often say that AI will replace humans, but when AI replaces humans, At this time, what do humans do? Humans serve and train AI.&quot; Sugar Bandit said that &quot;technology is green&quot; is a huge illusion. Whether it is ChatGPT or many well-known artificial intelligence software, it requires a lot of manpower to train it, and these simple, repetitive and boring tasks often correspond to people in less developed areas of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the novel, she writes about the future of many people who have been left behind by the technological era, but these science fiction novels are almost becoming reality. In &quot;Half Articles and Half Tune&quot; written two years ago, residents living on an island are affected by ocean microplastics and gradually become plastic people. Recently, reports about microplastics harming human health have been appearing in the news. The body for rent in &quot;Running Ball&quot; involves the exploitation of the lower class by the upper class. When productivity develops to a certain extent, what people are exploited is not their labor power and intelligence, but their subjectivity and the joy of being a human being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why should we arouse concern for these people? Because today of these people may be our tomorrow. Now everyone seems to have no worries about food and clothing, live and work in peace and contentment, but it is possible that tomorrow due to something, the trajectory of life will continue. If we take care of those on the margins and speak for them, we will do something for our future,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
