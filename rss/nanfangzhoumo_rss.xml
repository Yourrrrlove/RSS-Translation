Going out of the palace means going home. At this moment, it is lying quietly in the Xu Wei Art Museum in Shaoxing. This is the first time it has been unfolded so completely. Prior to this, due to the limitations of the exhibition space, this long scroll had never been completely opened. Visitors to the exhibition could only see part of it. Even in the album, it could only be broken down piece by piece. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flowers in the four seasons have never been in full bloom at the same time. Peonies and peonies in spring, grapes and bananas in midsummer, osmanthus and pines in autumn, bamboo branches and old plums with snow in winter, all splashing together to create a wonderful achievement. The &quot;Rise of Smoke and Clouds&quot; by Xu Wei, the founder of Chinese freehand brushwork and a giant of the generation. The self-revealed poem at the end of the volume is even more sophisticated: &quot;I am dripping with ink while playing games. Flowers and plants will be mixed all the time. No wonder there are two strokes missing in the painting. The way of heaven has been very bad recently.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening time of Xu Wei Art Museum is different. It was only officially put into use in 2021, which was still during the COVID-19 epidemic. Since the opening of the museum, there have been only three large-scale exhibitions, but each of them was &quot;flawless&quot;. The opening exhibition was the exhibition of the &quot;freak Ivy&quot; Xu Wei himself, followed by Chen Laolian. By 2023, It is a special performance by Ren Bonian, and each performance is worth a special trip. The 13-meter &quot;Flowers of the Four Seasons&quot; came from Ren Bonian&#39;s exhibition. Although Xu Wei and his fellow countryman Ren Bonian are more than 300 years apart in time, the intersection in space and the transmission of culture can be called the inheritance of pen and ink in a broad sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/HPXewWe9C11GQigdCrEXNX4QPRGcowIm1pwsasyB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/HPXewWe9C11GQigdCrEXNX4QPRGcowIm1pwsasyB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259263&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhong Kui in the works of Ren Bonian&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ren Bonian, a painter in the late Qing Dynasty, was a leader among the &quot;Shanghai School&quot; and the &quot;Four Rens&quot;, especially the figures. Good at painting. When Ren Bonian was young, his family ran a rice shop, but his father was good at painting and taught him in his spare time. It is said that Ren Bonian was able to draw lifelike figures very early. It is said that one time someone came to see his father, but his father was not there. When he came back and heard about it, he asked Ren Bonian who the visitor was. Bonian was only ten years old at the time and could not answer the guest&#39;s name, so he had to take a piece of paper and draw the person&#39;s name. His appearance was obvious to his father at a glance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ren Bonian was 22 years old, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom invaded Shaoxing and his father was killed. Ren Bonian was also involved in the war and held the flag for the Taiping Army. He later lived in Ningbo and Shanghai and made a living selling paintings. Ren Xiong and Ren Xun among the &quot;Four Rens on the Sea&quot; are Ren Bonian&#39;s clan uncles, and they both taught him painting, but he soon became better than his master. In this exhibition of Ren Bonian&#39;s paintings titled &quot;Impermanent Brushwork, Elegance and Richness&quot;, his paintings are displayed together with the other &quot;Three Rens&quot;, making a judgment, although he learned from Ren Xun The complicated &quot;nail head and rat tail&quot; brushwork, but the same painting of people, Ren Bonian&#39;s stylist Fa Chen Laolian immediately got rid of Ren Xun&#39;s vulgarity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Su Wu shepherding sheep, Xizhi loves geese, Zhong Kui...these are common themes in Ren Bonian&#39;s works, and they are characters he repeatedly painted. The Zhong Kui he painted is especially chic, with a high attitude and a swaggering look. The knights, often in these works with new and surprising shapes, you can get a glimpse of the painter&#39;s true temperament and sense of humor. The same goes for his paintings of flowers and birds. The fat bird with its big white eyes comes from Bada Shanren, but the extraordinary rise of Bada turned into joy in Ren Bonian&#39;s place. The chicks that have just emerged from their eggshells under the crape myrtle flowers are fluffy and childish. His gait and expression are like those of a gangster, he is still young and arrogant, which makes people smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/Egpnr7tr8haTxsmnwxwnPmwCUl88sESebNpNhPcg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;461&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/Egpnr7tr8haTxsmnwxwnPmwCUl88sESebNpNhPcg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259264&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Aunt Gongsun is considered the best master of sword dancing in the prosperous Tang Dynasty&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most interesting one is &quot;A Picture of Aunt Gongsun Dancing with Swords&quot;. It is said that Aunt Gongsun was the number one dancer in the prosperous age of Kaiyuan, and was promoted to be the best dancer in the prosperous Tang Dynasty for her sword dancing. Zhang Xu, the grass sage, understood the essence of cursive script from her sword skills, and Wu Daozi, the painting sage, also learned about Gongsun Auntie’s dance by watching her dance. Use the sword to learn how to use the pen. What the actual situation is cannot be determined now, but look at Ren Bonian&#39;s painting of sword dancing. Gongsun danced the two white blades as if they were practiced softly. The artist did not hesitate to draw hundreds of circles to record the imaginary and the real. All the traces of the sword flying across the air, the leaves on the big tree branches behind Aunt Gongsun trembled, as if they felt the sword energy, but Aunt Gongsun herself remained unmoved, her expression was quite calm, she was the one who stood firm among the thousands of changes. The core of change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Beihong once said: Ren Bonian is &quot;the first Chinese painter after Qiu Shizhou (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qiu Ying&lt;/span>;) &quot;I don&#39;t care whether this statement is fair or not, but at least it reflects Xu Beihong&#39;s preference for Ren Bonian. This preference may be related to Ren Bonian&#39;s position. He lives in Shanghai all year round and makes a living selling paintings. Therefore, his paintings combine literati paintings and fireworks. Indeed, we can see many traces of connecting the past and the future, connecting China and the world. It is a rich and flexible tradition of calligraphy and painting, which is at the confluence and turning point of the tide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都新力量]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261516]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;The power of a city to move forward largely comes from the new strength of the new youth.

Image source: Pinduoduo Weibo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 28, 2023, Beijing time, Pinduoduo’s intraday trading repeatedly hit new highs, rising by more than 18%. Within fifteen minutes, the market value increased by $100 million. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the opening to the closing, Pinduoduo’s total market value soared from US$156.4 billion to US$184.7 billion, a surge of nearly 30 billion. As of the close, Pinduoduo was only tens of billions away from Alibaba, which has a market capitalization of US$195.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If compared according to the price limit rules of China&#39;s A-share market, Pinduoduo is only one &quot;price limit&quot; away from Alibaba. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s rapid rise has triggered heated discussions among investors. Some people lamented that the throne of e-commerce is about to change hands and that &quot;an era of great things is coming&quot;, while others joked that &quot;the higher the stock price rises, the poorer everyone becomes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fierce reaction of the capital market stems from Pinduoduo’s outstanding performance in the third quarter of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 28, Pinduoduo (PDD.Nasdaq) released its financial report for the third quarter of 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;financial report&quot;), with revenue of 68.84 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 94%, not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP), net profit attributable to Pinduoduo’s ordinary shareholders was 17.027 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 37%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We can clearly feel the continued recovery of the economy, as well as the potential and resilience of the consumer market. At the same time, we also see from user behavior that consumption upgrades are both about quality and price. The optimization of price-performance ratio is consumers&#39; ultimate pursuit of good products at good prices.&quot; said Chen Lei, Chairman and Co-CEO of Pinduoduo Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reviewing Pinduoduo’s past financial reports, it achieved (Non-GAAP) quarterly profit for the first time in the third quarter of 2020, a year-on-year increase of 89%. Since then, although revenue has doubled on average every quarter, it was not until the second quarter of 2021 that Pinduoduo achieved double growth in revenue and net profit in a single quarter for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to now, Pinduoduo has drawn a significant upward curve of revenue growth and net profit doubling for two consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Buy a lot of groceries, a hidden revenue tool&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei attributed the revenue growth to the improvement of the consumer environment and the implementation of the company&#39;s &quot;high-quality development&quot; strategy. Judging from the financial report, Pinduoduo’s 94% revenue growth was due to the double increase in revenue from its two main businesses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Online marketing services and other services increased by 39% year-on-year, and transaction service revenue increased by as much as 315% year-on-year. The two account for about half of the total revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What supports the growth of transaction service revenue is generally an increase in the number of active merchants on the platform and an increase in the average transaction service revenue of each active merchant (i.e. commission). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter learned from a Pinduoduo merchant that the transaction commission is charged based on the sales price of the completed order, and the commission will not be refunded if the consumer returns the product. Pinduoduo did not release GMV (gross merchandise transaction) data in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Lichong, President of Huisheng International Capital, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that transaction service fees actually include the income of Duoduo Maicai. This quarter’s unexpected growth is due to the rapid expansion of Duoduo Maicai. Huang Lichong once served as executive director and managing director of the investment banking department of China International Finance Securities (Hong Kong). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduomaicai was launched in August 2020. Since then, Pinduoduo’s transaction service fee income has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei commented at the 2020 third quarter earnings conference call that Duoduo’s grocery shopping business is “a platform that consumers use very frequently.” Entering the fourth quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s number of active buyers surpassed Alibaba for the first time, reaching 788 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment, Duoduomaicai has gone through many rounds of fierce battles between platforms and has survived the dark moment of community group buying. According to reports from many media including Qilu Evening News, nine provinces have been shut down in order to target the prosperity of the sinking market. Jingxi Pinpin is only left in Langfang, Hebei and Beijing. Other community group buying has also been shut down one after another. Currently, Pinduoduo and Meituan Each controls half of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2023, the US asset management company HAYDEN CAPITAL estimated that by 2025, Duoduo Maicai will contribute at least about 14 billion yuan in EBIT to Pinduoduo, which may start in 2023 Achieve overall profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial performance meeting, Chen Lei introduced that Pinduoduo started out in agricultural products and retained a number of users through agricultural products services. However, the current online rate of this category is low, and there is huge potential in the future. potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Duoduo’s grocery shopping, the market generally speculates that Duoduo’s cross-border services may create a new revenue growth curve for Pinduoduo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, Pinduoduo launched the cross-border e-commerce project Temu, which Chen Lei regarded as his &quot;third venture.&quot; At that time, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance, Liu Jun, said that cross-border business was in its early stages and would have little impact on financial reports. Temu’s revenue data was not announced in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduo’s cross-border project is led by Gu Pingping, the former head of Duoduo’s grocery shopping, and inherits Pinduoduo’s domestic supply, talent, and marketing advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial report meeting, Liu Jun said, &quot;Pinduoduo&#39;s global business is still in a very early stage, and the team is still increasing its understanding of consumer needs in different markets around the world.&quot; Currently, Temu has launched a In 2016, it has expanded to 40 countries and regions around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Getting out of the quagmire of losses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 28, in contrast to the upward trend in Pinduoduo’s stock price, the stock price of Alibaba (BABA.NYSE) dropped all the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumption downgrading is an increasingly clear trend. Consumers are moving from platforms with high unit prices to low-price platforms. Low price is still the key for Pinduoduo to occupy the sinking market in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at Pinduoduo’s growth history, the “10 billion subsidy” strategy has not only opened up the market for it, but is also the main reason for dragging down its financial performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo has faced significant losses since its listing. From 2018 to the first quarter of 2020, losses continued to expand. In June 2019, after the &quot;Ten Billion Subsidy&quot; was launched, it achieved GMV growth and increased user activity. The price was that its sales and marketing expenses exceeded profits, which was equivalent to all the revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the second quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s losses have narrowed. Ma Jing, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance at the time, said at the earnings conference call, “Profitability will not be considered this year.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the third quarter of 2020 that Pinduoduo achieved profitability for the first time, which was also when CEO Chen Lei took office. The first report card after. This year, Pinduoduo launched Duoduo’s grocery shopping business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo really &quot;taken off&quot; in the second quarter of 2021, with both revenue and profit increasing, and getting out of the mire of losses. Since then, it has almost maintained a double-digit profit growth. In particular, three quarters in 2022 will achieve multiple growth, with profits in the second quarter nearly tripling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jing responded at the second quarter 2021 conference call that revenue growth stems from the increase in the number of users and the increase in user psychological share, and the second quarter is the off-season for marketing, so marketing expenditures are small and there are seasonal factors. Special reasons for sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Pinduoduo executives also made no secret of the fact that the increase in profits comes from cost reduction and efficiency increase during the 2021 financial results conference call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Lichong said that over the years, Pinduoduo has optimized its operating costs, reduced some unnecessary expenses, increased profit margins by increasing product prices and reducing after-sales service costs, while investing in technology, logistics, agriculture and other fields. , improve its own competitiveness and business efficiency. These strategies have effectively helped it get out of losses and achieve profits beyond expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s executive director and co-CEO Zhao Jiazhen revealed in a recent earnings conference call that during the just past “Double Eleven” promotion, the number of users of Pinduoduo’s “10 billion subsidy” has exceeded 620 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the first trading day after the financial report was released, employees on Alibaba’s intranet discussed Pinduoduo’s performance in the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba partner Jack Ma rarely replied, &quot;All great companies are born in winter. The era of AI e-commerce has just begun, and it is both an opportunity and a challenge for everyone. I would like to congratulate Pinduoduo for the past few years. Decision-making, execution and efforts. No one is better, but those who can reform for the sake of tomorrow and the organization that are willing to pay any price and sacrifice are respected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戏骨云集的《风声》姐妹篇，砸了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261518]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The new theatrical film &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; is the latest version of &quot;The Wind&quot; &quot;Sister volume of &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also an original work by Mai Jia + director Gao Qunshu, with a spy war theme + a bone drama, but the reputation is far different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1511&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259921&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Today, 14 years after its release, &quot;The Wind&quot; is still the leading Chinese-language spy suspense film. 600,000 people gave it a high score of 8.4 on Douban, which is better than 95% of dramas and 98% of thrillers.

The identities of Jin Shenshui and Lin Yingying were two bright cards that were played too early, and there was no suspense left.

But the characters who appear in the second half, such as the members of the military command team stationed in Nanjing, Lin Yingying&#39;s relatives, etc., these supporting roles are too homogeneous. In fact, there is no need to type subtitles for every person who appears, nor do you need to give everyone equal time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such a passing character and hasty explanation of the ending give the second half a sense of deja vu, as if you have finished the plot and left work early, and the narrative is cohesive&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; span>;Compared with the first half, it can be regarded as loose prose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To use a common saying to describe the impression of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot;, it is that &quot;it is full of energy, then fades, and three times it is exhausted.&quot; The more you watch, the more discouraged you are, until it collapses thousands of miles. The film wants to portray the change of mentality of the triple agent. It stands to reason that the character will be highlighted and sublimated at the end, but this mechanism obviously fails in this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/88632c0053d9c80d3cbd10e11477fa59.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/88632c0053d9c80d3cbd10e11477fa59.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259931&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Edge of the Knife&quot; is not as good as &quot;The Wind&quot;, which has a lot to do with the tendency of film and television adaptation. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The original work of &quot;The Sound of the Wind&quot; is divided into Dongfeng, West Wind and Jingfeng. From the perspectives of different narrators, it restores the ghost-catching past events in Qiuzhuang with different versions that are difficult to distinguish between true and false.

Based on the size of the original work, it would be a good choice to make a 40-episode TV series. The 120 minutes of the film version is really difficult to carry such complex characters and emotions.

For financial services such as finance, business travel and employee commuting are the three main composition items, but because of the difficulty of accounting in this part, there are fewer life insurance companies that have actively disclosed. In addition, although the insurance industry attaches great importance to ESG reports, most ESG reports have not obtained third -party certification, so objectivity and independence are doubtful.

The former refers to the fact that Hengdian Film and Television Base is now dominated by the &quot;vertical screen short drama&quot; shooting team; the latter refers to the short drama application platform ReelShort, which has begun to conquer overseas markets and even topped the U.S. iOS entertainment list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22, the &quot;2023-2024 China Micro-Short Drama Market Research Report&quot; released by iiMedia Consulting showed that China&#39;s online short drama market size will be 37.39 billion yuan in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 267.65%. A total of 481 new short dramas were released in the first half of 2023, exceeding the level for the whole of 2022. It is estimated that the size of China&#39;s short drama market will reach 100.68 billion yuan in 2027. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rise of short videos has not only reshaped the audio-visual habits of netizens, but also accommodated netizens’ search, shopping, entertainment, and social needs: from search engines to short video platforms, from TV series to Switching to short dramas, switching from playing online games to watching short videos, switching from e-commerce shopping to live streaming... &quot;Short Video+&quot; is profoundly affecting the ecology of the Internet industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, various major Internet platforms have derived new business models of &quot;short video + advertising&quot; and &quot;short video + e-commerce&quot;, which have greatly subverted the traditional profit model: ByteDance recently announced the contraction of its gaming business, Short videos are fully embraced; the time spent watching short videos by netizens has exceeded the time spent on online games; traditional online writers are rushing into new tracks; major film and television bases have turned into &quot;vertical screen versions&quot;... These phenomena show that the short video era has created a new era of short videos. The rise of the drama has also profoundly changed the overall ecology of the upstream and downstream industrial chains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2023 China Online Audiovisual Development Research Report&quot; shows that among the 1 billion short video users in 2022, about 50.4% of users have watched short dramas within 3 minutes. The size of the short drama market in 2023 will almost reach half of the national movie box office, creating many traffic miracles and myths of sudden wealth. For example, in September 2023, the traffic miracle of &quot;Wushuang&quot; exceeded 100 million in revenue in 8 days, which caused a sensation. , the myth of getting rich &quot;completed in one week, released in one month, and achieving financial freedom&quot; is also widely circulated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The success of short plays is rooted in human nature, which is a deep need that people cannot erase. Human nature naturally loves &quot;refreshment&quot;, &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;relief&quot;, seeks emotional catharsis, and longs for emotional compensation. While the audience scolded the stereotyped short drama, they still couldn&#39;t help but finish watching a short drama with dozens of episodes before going to bed and experiencing the excitement of &quot;it turns out that success and love can come so quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short plays can often satisfy people&#39;s certain &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; the inherent pleasure mechanism of human nature. Themes such as &quot;Grand grudges between wealthy families&quot;, &quot;Marriage first, love later&quot; and &quot;The domineering president fell in love with me&quot; are everlasting. Revenge, counterattack, the boss&#39;s sweet pet, a golden son-in-law, marrying into a wealthy family... Such plots are also repeated many times. Can&#39;t get tired of watching it. The protagonist of the short drama has either become an alternative Count of Monte Cristo, or a film and television version of &quot;Long Aotian&quot; or &quot;Mary Sue&quot;, or it seems to be the product of pressing shortcut keys on a long and drawn-out urban emotional drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slightly different from the previous Internet ecology, the current industry supervision has become more and more synchronized, which is a new situation worthy of attention. The recent news that &quot;Tik Tok, Kuaishou, and WeChat platforms are jointly cracking down on illegal short dramas&quot; is also consistent with the fact that the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has &quot;already removed 25,000 short dramas from the shelves. The next step will be to launch a one-month special rectification work on online short dramas.&quot; ” echoed the announcement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the Internet industry has indeed been &quot;leading the way for three to five years.&quot; Past success may not be maintained for a long time in the face of new trends. The rise of short dramas with the help of short videos fully illustrates this point. At the same time, the &quot;reckless state&quot; of the Internet industry&#39;s barbaric growth and turf racing has passed, and the advancement of technology and industry and the follow-up of regulatory regulations are increasingly showing a &quot;same frequency&quot; state. In compliance with regulatory requirements, the pursuit of high-quality and high-quality content will still be the main focus of the short drama market in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[七百岁村庙的“一生”：东南最早元代建筑被发现]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261520]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/29/9cbb99999f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 29/9cbb99999f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259937&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Overlooking Fook Sin Hall.

It is a group of vernacular temple buildings, which conforms to the usual orientation rules of Chinese architecture: &quot;sitting Different from &quot;north to south&quot;, Fushan Hall conforms to the mountainous terrain of Zhengwei Village and faces south as a whole. The main hall is dedicated to the Three Treasures, and the left and right side halls are dedicated to Guanyin and King Dongping. It is a blend of Buddhism, Taoism and folk beliefs that are common in village temples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The main hall faces a Qing Dynasty stage across the courtyard, and is integrated with the main hall through the corridor. Before the main hall was confirmed as a Yuan structure, the stage was the narrative center of the entire building complex. When people in the village talked about Fu Shan Tang, they would always talk about the story of the stage, but they were completely unaware of the main hall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;discovery&quot; of Fu Shan Tang was not to find the existence of this building, but to confirm its identity as being built in the Yuan Dynasty.

Through rough dating of style, it is not possible to judge that the structure of Fushan Hall is no later than the early Ming Dynasty, and may even be in the Yuan Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On that day, Liu Yan was not taken into Fushan Hall for the time being.

Before Zheng came to the village, the main families in the village were Zhang and Wei. I don’t think this legend is likely to be an attachment, but Fushan Hall was probably built in the Song Dynasty, because the inscription mentions “reconstruction”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2021, Zhou Miao met Fu Shan Tang for the first time. He stayed there for a long time, &quot;it was really beyond imagination,&quot; he recalled his feelings at that time to the Southern Weekend reporter. He is a young teacher in the Department of Architecture of Zhejiang City University and is fond of ancient dwellings in northern Fujian and southern Zhejiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liang Sicheng, in &quot;The History of Chinese Architecture in Pictures&quot;, described the three periods of existing ancient architecture in China from the perspective of the history of artistic styles. The architecture of the Tang Dynasty was &quot;grand. &quot;Jing&quot; became &quot;mellow&quot; from the Song and Yuan Dynasties to the early Ming Dynasty, and &quot;straight&quot; during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Zhou Miao&#39;s research focuses on the transformation of architecture in the Tang and Song Dynasties. When he saw Fushan Hall, his professional intuition told him that the combination of columns, beams, and brackets had a &quot;Song style&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this era, to be able to find a metastructure in the humid south is a rare thing for any architectural scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the field of ancient architecture, there is a saying that &quot;Look to Shanxi in the north and Fujian in the south.&quot; The quantity, quality and density of preserved ancient buildings in these two provinces are far behind. more than other provinces. But Fujian is more unique than Shanxi. &quot;Shanxi is close to the Central Plains and the capitals of past dynasties, and the overall evolution of architecture has been relatively synchronized with the Central Plains dynasties. Maybe some styles have changed in the Central Plains, and Shanxi will also change in about 50 years.&quot; But Fujian is different, especially in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian and southern Zhejiang. , the development of architecture lags behind. If we see a style from the Song Dynasty there, it may be as late as the early Ming Dynasty. &quot;So when we see a house in Fujian with a fairly old style, we dare not make a judgment.&quot; Zhou Miao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Jian&#39;ou, located in the upper reaches of the Min River, is a mountainous area, but it was the first area in Fujian to be developed by Han immigrants. In 206 AD, the Sun Wu regime established Jian&#39;an County, the first county-level administrative region in Fujian history, in today&#39;s Jianou. Until the Song Dynasty, Jianzhou, centered on Jianou, was the cultural center of Fujian. At that time, Jianban books were popular all over the world, and Zhu Xi&#39;s Neo-Confucianism was also nurtured here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Miao later realized that although the mountainous areas of northern Fujian further north were developed very late, the narrow valley area in the upper reaches of the Min River was not too late. Specific to the style of architecture, there may also be a &quot;time difference&quot; between the Jian&#39;ou area and other northern Fujian areas. This time difference &quot;hedges&quot; the time difference between northern Fujian and the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Weird power confuses the gods,&quot; Liu Yan said, pointing to the intricately carved cat beams and dou bao on the beams of Fushan Hall. Based on this intuition, he also boldly speculated that Fushan Hall was built in the Yuan Dynasty. &quot;It feels like it is earlier than the Ming Dynasty, but it is unlikely to be in the Song Dynasty. Because both the Song and Ming Dynasties tend to be orthodox and regular. Only the buildings of the Yuan Dynasty can have this kind of unconventional and unconventional style.&quot; Weird and weird approach.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a94ef1b375.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a94ef1b375.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259940&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The beams of Fushan Hall are carved with complicated and strange cat beams and fighting arms.

After posting it, I refused all media interviews, &quot; He feels that he has completed his historical mission,&quot; Liu Yan said. In October 2023, Liu Yan completed the surveying and mapping task of the covered bridge project. Before returning to his workplace, Kunming University of Science and Technology, he decided to go to Fushan Hall again to conduct the first surveying and mapping of it. &quot;Do you want to come? You may come, we may be able to persuade him to be interviewed.&quot; He asked the southern weekend reporter. At the end of October, Southern Weekend reporters met Fu Shan Tang and its discoverer, and also watched Liu Yan&#39;s team conduct a brief survey and mapping of Fu Shan Tang. What impressed me deeply was not only the building itself, but also the people who were bound by Fuk Sen Tang. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Living - &quot;Growth&quot; in the eyes of architectural archeology&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Witnessing the discovery of Fushantang with her own eyes made Liu Yan feel that there was a kind of destiny The fate is inside. He is currently writing a series of studies on buildings &quot;sitting south and facing north&quot;. This architectural form that &quot;conflicts&quot; with the norm fascinates him. Fushantang appeared at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yan studied for a PhD in &quot;Architectural Archeology&quot; in Germany, and &quot;fine surveying&quot; is the core tool in this field. For a large building, complete architectural archeology may take several years, even decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Germany, where Liu Yan studied, precision surveying and mapping is a &quot;basic plan&quot; for carrying out cultural preservation work. &quot;There are no levels of cultural preservation in Germany. As long as it is cultural preservation, it is necessary to do such a complete and in-depth survey and mapping.&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A scholar of architectural archeology may not be able to do a few cases of precise surveying and mapping in his lifetime. Liu Yan&#39;s German mentor spent thirty years of his energy on a church. For the country, “this set of things is too luxurious. There are only a handful of cases across the country that can achieve the depth of architectural archeology through precise surveying and mapping. In Fujian, even the Luoyuan and Chen Taiwei Palace built in the Song Dynasty may not have been built yet.” Do enough mapping to match his identity,&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Architectural archeology is an emerging discipline in China. Liu Yan vividly described archeology as digging down layer by layer, &quot;and their strata are spread horizontally.&quot; Architectural archeology discussed the overlapping historical layers in above-ground buildings. For example, a Song Dynasty building was replaced in the Ming Dynasty. A certain component, a corridor was added in the Qing Dynasty... Just like archeology, there are also &quot;strata&quot; layer by layer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/6c5fd28f5c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/6c5fd28f5c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259941&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The interior of the main hall of Fuxiantang. Photo courtesy/&quot;No name for now&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Miao described Fushan Hall as a &quot;growing&quot; building: &quot;Obviously, it was expanded and expanded in different periods. Renovated.&quot; At the scene, Southern Weekend reporters were not given a detailed explanation of this development: there is an inscription from the Hongzhi Year of the Ming Dynasty under the purlin in the front of the main hall, an inscription from the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty under the porch, and an inscription from the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty in the side hall. , the stage shows the style of the late Qing Dynasty. The main hall itself contains different components and structures from the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, not to mention the rich &quot;strata&quot; overlapping of the entire building complex. &quot;Using &#39;Yuan to Qing&#39; to describe the age of Fushan Hall is more accurate and closer to the essence of architectural heritage.&quot; I don&#39;t think so yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yan said that architectural archeology is &quot;architectural detective science.&quot; Through comprehensive collection of on-site clues, architects can find subtle changes in buildings in the river of time, thereby inferring social and personnel changes in the past dynasties. This is what he wants to do to Fuxiantang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;What the early Architecture Society did was architectural archeology, but at that time the focus of scholars&#39; work was still to find the earliest buildings, and to find Tang Gou structures. , Looking for Song Gou, I can’t wait to peel off all the historical coverage of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.” Liu Yan said. The main hall of Hualin Temple in Fuzhou is such a classic representative. &quot;The original survey map did not even record the Qing Dynasty corridor. During the restoration and repair, the Qing Dynasty corridor was directly demolished.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today&#39;s architectural archeology is different from the pursuits of early scholars. On the one hand, it pursues more detailed surveying and mapping, and on the other hand, it pays more attention to the &quot;life story&quot; of a building - the completeness of a building. The life narrative of a city not only focuses on its &quot;first construction&quot; or &quot;original&quot; youthful and heroic appearance, but also understands its changes through the ages and its life state until its twilight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To understand the &quot;growth&quot; of Fu Shan Tang, we must not only start with the building itself, but also the historical environment where the building is located is also a key factor. Before the road was opened, the only way to enter and exit Zhengwei Village was through an ancient post road across a mountain stream. The ancient post road was connected to covered bridges. There was a covered bridge, Xian&#39;en Bridge, at the entrance of the village, and a covered bridge, Desheng Bridge, at the end of the village. The two covered bridges marked the entrance. The only access to the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The ancient post road was paved with wide stone slabs. &quot;The ancient road was so wide, it can be seen that the village itself had financial resources in ancient times.&quot; Liu Yan speculated. There are two more covered bridges next to the village. &quot;Those who have the ability to build covered bridges must be because the village is located on an important passage. It may be an important trade route in ancient times. People must pass through here to have the motivation to build it.&quot; Such a large covered bridge.&quot; Zhou Miao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What surprised Zhou Miao even more was the Ming Dynasty residences in Zhengwei Village. &quot;It is already a great thing to have Ming Dynasty residences in a village, and Zhengwei Village There may be more than five or six Ming Dynasty residences, and there are also many exquisite Qing Dynasty residences, which shows that this village has been prosperous for a long time. Its population reproduction and wealth accumulation must far exceed that of other surrounding villages.&quot; The accumulation of wealth has made Fushantang Large-scale reconstruction was carried out in the Yuan Dynasty, and during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there was the possibility of continuous growth, with side halls, corridors, and stages...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/bf8914da2f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1188&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/bf8914da2f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259942&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;福There is a stone tablet next to the entrance of the charity hall, which is engraved with the &quot;Yicang Stele&quot; written in the 50th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign. It has a chronicle on the front and a name on the back. According to this monument, there was originally a Mingjiao temple not far from Zhengwei Village. After it was abandoned, the villagers reclaimed the land and set up a charity warehouse in Fushan Hall, which could not only support the village, but also invest in public affairs, just like the current charity foundation. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The main industry in Zhengwei Village is timber. The towering ancient trees in the surrounding mountains are the village&#39;s greatest wealth. In ancient times, villagers cut down trees and put the wood into the river. Following the water flow, they arrived in Fuzhou. Until the reform and opening up, the village had always been an important part of the timber industry chain in northeastern Fujian. &quot;We still have land in Fuzhou, and we were relatively wealthy at that time.&quot; Zheng Fawang said that his ancestors were also engaged in the timber business. His ancestral house was built in the late Qing Dynasty and is located in the middle of Zhengwei Village. It is also a tall building. A mansion with deep walls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;By combining clan power with industry, the Zheng clan controls large areas of surrounding mountains and forests. Now several surrounding villages are also dominated by the Zheng surname. In ancient times, it was the &#39;sphere of influence&#39; of Zhengwei Village.&quot; said Zheng Jinlan, a staff member of the Dikou Town Cultural Station. Her hometown is in a village not far from Zhengwei Village, and her family&#39;s Zheng surname is derived from Zhengwei Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bad - As long as there are people’s activities, the buildings will be changed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walking in the alleys of the village, there were once tall ancient houses on both sides , many of which are only ruins. Not long after the Bailu solar term passed, a red paper notice for &quot;Bailu Tomb Sweeping&quot; was posted on the notice board in the village. It read &quot;Guimao Year, Bawu Cemetery&quot; - Bawu Gong was Zheng Hao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different from the general Qingming tomb sweeping, Zhengwei Village arranges ancestor worship and sweeping in the Bailu solar term every year. This custom is said to have lasted for hundreds of years. According to the villagers, during the white dew, the water comes out and the water steps in the stream are easier to walk, so it was decided to visit the tomb at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fushantang plays the role of the faith center in the small regional community centered on Zhengwei Village. When women in the village reach the age of 60, they will go to Fushan Hall to hold a grand ceremony, wearing special cyan clothes and bright red flowers on their heads, &quot;just like primary school students registering at school when they are old.&quot; Zheng Fawang said that the local People call them Qingyi Zhaipo. The Tsing Yi Zhaipo&#39;s daily chanting place is Fu Shan Tang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a7e2df5f17.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a7e2df5f17.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259943&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;There is a close relationship between Qingyi Zhaipo.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the few days of interviewing in Zhengwei Village, I met Tsing Yi Zhaipo women in Fushan Hall every day. They chanted sutras, burned incense and chatted. Joking and basking in the sun, the laughter often drowned out the sound of chanting sutras. Obviously, the religious space has become a public space. During the days of chanting, they temporarily leave their families and spend some time with their sisters without worrying about trivial matters. Fu Shan Tang is a small sanctuary for the Tsing Yi vegetarians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guanyin&#39;s birthday on February 19th, Buddha&#39;s birthday on April 8th, Amitabha&#39;s birthday on November 17th...

The busiest days of the year for Fu Shan Tang are from the 13th to the 15th day of the first lunar month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Every year on the twelfth day of the first lunar month, people from Zhengwei Village drive more than 80 kilometers to the Linshui Palace in Gutian County next door. Please come to the Water Queen, come A tour around the village. The Linshui Empress&#39; name is Chen Jinggu, which is a popular folk belief in the mountainous areas of southern Zhejiang and northern Fujian. There is Lin Mo Niang on the seaside, Chen Jinggu in the mountains, and Gutian Linshui Palace is her ancestral temple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At four or five o&#39;clock in the morning on the 13th day of the first lunar month, the people who invited the gods set off from the Gutian Ancestral Temple and returned. The trucks carried the statues of the gods, and a group of cars followed them. Drive back to Zhengwei Village. In the first month of 2023, Zheng Fawang followed the team on a trip to Gutian. It took more than an hour on the highway and was a difficult mountain road in ancient times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Please return to Linshui Empress, walk across the covered bridge at the entrance of the village, and first settle in a small temple at the entrance of the village. The architectural history of this temple is more than 200 years old. There are inscriptions from the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty written on the temple beams. In the afternoon of that day, the villagers carried the statue of the god and walked around the whole village. Along the way, believers worshiped and made vows. Finally, it was carried to the main hall of Fushantang on the left side of the village. Facing the stage of Fushantang, everyone placed the statue properly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the 14th and 15th days, there are lively activities to watch theaters and reward gods. The play is for the gods, and of course the mountain people from all over the country can also take advantage of it. The village troupe performed hard, the villagers prayed for God&#39;s blessings, firecrackers and red candles filled the sky, and the activities of wandering gods in the first month reached a climax. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is rare that a village in the mountains has its own theater troupe. The Zheng Long Theater Troupe in Zheng Weicun has a history of more than 200 years. On the wooden wall behind the stage, there is an inscription of the troupe&#39;s performance in the seventh year of Guangxu&#39;s reign. If Zheng Fawang&#39;s grandfather is still alive, he would be over a hundred years old. Zheng Fawang remembers that his grandfather played the erhu in a troupe before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/8d36a45d45.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1228&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/8d36a45d45.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259944&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The stage of the Qing Dynasty directly opposite the main hall of Fu Shan Tang, every year on the 14th and 15th day of the first lunar month, the Zhenglong Troupe performs here to reward the gods.

The neighboring Nanya Town just invited them to perform there last month. Today there are still 20 to 30 people in the troupe, and the actors and musicians are all elders and aunties in the village. &quot;Now there are no young people joining, and there is no fixed income.&quot; Zheng Fawang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Miao studied ancient architecture in Shanxi in his early years. He found that many temples in Shanxi, especially the older ones, had been controlled by the cultural relics department, and their incense was gradually cut off. Local residents have become increasingly alienated from it. &quot;Architecture here is still very closely related to people&#39;s lives. Traditional sacrificial rituals, belief spaces, and belief habits can still be bound to this settlement and this building.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align : left;&quot;>;In 1951, Zheng Weicun Primary School was founded in Fuxiantang, with dozens of students. In 1960, Fu Shan Tang was turned into a public canteen. Different from the village temples in Shanxi, after the reform and opening up, the policy was relaxed, and Fushan Hall quickly became the center of religious activities in Zhengwei Village again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, religious activities and the protection of ancient buildings seem to be an intractable contradiction. After the Fushan Hall was discovered, the leaders of the Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau repeatedly asked Zheng Fawang about the issue of open flames in Fushan Hall. Zhou Miao remembers that on New Year&#39;s Eve in 2019, Buyue Bridge, an ancient covered bridge in Jianou City, caught fire, &quot;because there were too many people burning incense on the bridge that day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As long as there are human activities, the building will be changed. Sometimes, this change is slow, like the slow growth of Fuxiantang, and human activities wash away gently like waves. But some drastic changes have been common in recent years. In early November 2023, it was not discovered that the Yu family ancestral hall built in the twelfth year of Hongzhi (1499) in the Ming Dynasty in Lu Village, Gutian County, Fujian Province had been completely demolished by the villagers. The new ancestral hall being rebuilt &quot;looks like a nondescript, nondescript A monster that is not a horse but a donkey.&quot; It is human nature for villagers to want to rebuild their ancestral temple when they have money, but they do not think this is a mismatch between cultural level and economic level. &quot;Such an out-of-print ancestral temple with a clear date of more than 500 years , until it was demolished by the villagers, it was neither a cultural relic nor a historical building, and had no protection status at all.&quot; Let’s not talk about it for now. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;Empty - what to keep&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the founding of New China, Zhengwei Village was an armed village with its own village. At most, the village was armed with more than a hundred guns, making it look like a sizable army. To this day, there are still signs on the streets of the village that read, &quot;It is forbidden by law to keep guns privately.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/1b56481471.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1192&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/1b56481471.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259945&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Slogans posted on the streets of Zhengweicun in October 2023.

Many people speculate that Zhengwei Village controlled the nearby mountains and forests at that time, and the Zheng family was a powerful local clan. In troubled times, the clan members used arms to defend themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the spring of 1936, the Communist Party of China established a 50-kilometer northeastern Fujian province centered on Dikou Town in Jianou, including Jianou, Songxi, Zhenghe, and Gutian. Guerrilla base area. The villagers&#39; armed forces soon integrated with the Northeastern Fujian guerrillas and became a reliable backup for the guerrillas. Since the villagers of Zhengwei Village are very familiar with firearms, the Zheng Family Ancestral Hall located in the center of the village naturally became a firearms repair shop for the guerrillas. The five-pointed star above the main entrance of the ancestral hall is the symbol of the Northeast Fujian guerrilla gun repair shop at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/16fb3c28ba.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/16fb3c28ba.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259946&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Above the main entrance of the Zheng Family Ancestral Hall in Zhengwei Village.

On May 13, 1948, Zeng Jingbing, Secretary of the CPC Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi Provincial Committee, and more than 200 guerrillas watched Gan Opera with local villagers in Fushan Hall. Later, Fu Shan Tang became a general cultural relic site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1982, villagers partially repaired the main hall of Fu Shan Tang. According to temporary observation, the materials used at that time were crude and small, &quot;far from the original structure.&quot; Maybe the conditions are too limited. In 2017, Zhengwei Village received protection funds from the &quot;Traditional Chinese Village&quot;. The main hall and porch of Fushantang were partially repaired. The components that did not meet the specifications in 1982 were replaced and the roof was renovated. Now inside the temple, the light-colored wood was replaced in 2017, and the difference from the dark old wood is clearly distinguishable. It was this careful renovation that allowed many of the calligraphy inscriptions in Fu Shan Tang to be remembered until six years later, when I would visit again without carrying an infrared camera...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;Compared with the Yu Family Ancestral Hall, the Fu Shan Tang Hall is lucky. It has enjoyed hundreds of years of incense, and because of the special status of the attached building and stage, it has escaped the vicissitudes of the 20th century until a group of right people discovered it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7287a7732b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7287a7732b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259947&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Looking down from the hill behind Fu Shan Tang, the Fu Shan Tang building complex is hidden among green bamboos. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to unavailable statistics, among the well-documented early wooden buildings newly discovered in Fujian Province in recent years, in addition to those that have been Among the demolished Yu family ancestral halls are Baofengyan in Anxi (Yongle period of Ming Dynasty), Longjian Palace in Zhangping (1482), Zhuo family ancestral hall in Youxi (Chenghua period of Ming Dynasty), and Hongnong Hall of Datian (Chenghua to Hongzhi years of Ming Dynasty). ), Yongtai Fairyland (1513)...most of them do not have any protected status. &quot;They have a very accurate and complete sorting of historical buildings.&quot; Liu Yan and Zhou Miao have a lot of contact with local ancient building enthusiasts in Fujian. Compared with official statistics, they sometimes rely on these people material. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;One problem now is that many local governments are actually unwilling to bear this risk, knowing that it is a valuable cultural relic, but it is not willing to report it. The situation exists. &quot;Zheng Jinlan told the reporter from the southern weekend. As long as it is not reported as a cultural relic point, no one needs to be responsible after being damaged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Protecting as many ancient architectural samples as possible is the basis for scholars to conduct systematic research. What is the position of Fu Shantang in the Yuan Dynasty architecture? Zhou Miao, who specializes in the Song and Yuan architecture, is difficult to say, &quot;because there are too few Yuan Dynasty architecture in the south.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The Yuan Dynasty buildings in the north are relatively retained, and in specific areas, the number can be analyzed as much as possible. &quot;In the north, it can be a level distinction of architecture in the Yuan Dynasty to comment on what different levels look like.&quot; Zhou Miao said. If Fushan Hall is placed in the northern yuan structure, then it is undoubtedly the level of low -level village Buddhist temples, but its hall is much larger than ordinary villages and temples. &quot;After the Northern Yuan Dynasty The combination of the structure of low -level buildings began to become messy, mixed, or messy and not particular about it. But the regulation and order of Foshantang are still pretty good, which is unexpected. &quot; /p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The Hall of Foshan Hall has gone through the storm of history, and now it is facing the empty nest of the countryside. Before the 1950s, there were more than 500 households in the village. Nowadays, there are only less than 800 people left in Zhengwei Village, and the entire administrative village (including 6 natural villages in the surrounding are). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Behind ancient buildings are not only discoverers and researchers, but also users who are closely related to them. After the logging industry disappeared, the village was in fact. The entire village costs about 200,000 yuan a year. The salary of the village committees and the village&#39;s sanitary expenses are sometimes difficult to guarantee. There are no young people in the village. After this generation of Tsing Yi Zhai&#39;s death, the daily maintenance and use of Fushantang is likely to lose activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Liu Yan is also very interested in the rituals and costumes of Tsing Yi Zhai, as well as the village&#39;s drama class. &quot;This village seems to have a magical power and is able to preserve so many ancient things.&quot; He plans to come back for research and mapping during the winter and summer vacations next year, and &quot;soak&quot; in the local area as long as possible to do real fieldwork in architectural anthropology. “It will be more interesting if we combine people and architecture to discuss it.” He also understood that if it was not recorded as soon as possible, the entire cultural system surrounding Fushantang would disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Jian&#39;er&#39;s &quot;upgrade&quot; movement of Fu Shantang is unfolding. Originally, Fushantang was just a general cultural protection point, and even the county insurance was not. Now it is promoted by &quot;cross -level&quot;. You can do a promotion work. &quot;Zheng Jinlan said. The provincial insurance is prepared for the future of the national security. &quot;The southern wood structure of the Yuan Dynasty will definitely enter the national insurance.&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Qingyi Zhai&#39;s daily lesson will definitely be affected by the upgrading of cultural relics protection levels. Zheng Fawang intends to prepare a tripod for them outside the temple so that the fragrant candle will no longer enter the hall. After bidding farewell to Qingyi Zhai, Liu Yanhe did not continue to drive north to visit Yunfeng Temple in Mountain Mountain. For the time being, it is a national security building in the west and east. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《再见爱人》：婚姻里谁都没错，日子怎么就没法过]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261541]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/92I6YaI3L2s2KiC36TxIsoT8b4MEQEvR9IDfU0Kz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/92I6YaI3L2s2KiC36TxIsoT8 b4MEQEvR9IDfU0Kz. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260006&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; producer Liu Le&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; reached its third season, and producer Liu Le finally realized his dream when he proposed the plan - bringing guests with him Entered the Civil Affairs Bureau for a day of filming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The service hall of the Aheqi County Civil Affairs Bureau is less than 200 square meters, and marriages and divorces are completed here. Three pairs of guests who didn&#39;t know whether they would get divorced witnessed the union of several local couples and the separation of families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Le used to be a social news reporter and worked in the Civil Affairs Bureau. After deciding to make &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, she asked the team to squat in front of the Civil Affairs Bureau. Although it was fruitless, the members all faced the original shock. They couldn&#39;t say anything at the moment. After returning, everyone had ups and downs. &quot;I want to shoot joys and sorrows all in the same place, and human feelings are not the same. When you made the promise, did you ever think about separation? When you separated, did you remember the promise?&quot; Liu Le said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the first season of the reality show &quot;Goodbye Love&quot;, which is closely related to &quot;divorce&quot;, will be launched. In the program, three pairs of guests who have problems in their marriages went on an 18-day trip to review the beauty of love, analyze marriage problems, and find answers to relationships. The program presents the trivial and difficult-to-discern life in public, and explores the details and deep conflicts of marriage, which resonates with the audience. In the autumn of 2023, the third season of &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; will be broadcast. Fu Seoul and Lao Liu, Ji Huanbo and Wang Shiqing, Wang Sleepy and Zhang Shuosheng are three lovers who &quot;look beautiful&quot; to outsiders, exposing the illusion, facing their respective dilemmas, and once again Generate discussions about intimacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Le, the core producer and chief director of this show, has been a social news reporter for four years and the director of &quot;Happy Camp&quot; for ten years. In the past three years, in addition to the &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; series, her His other works include &quot;The Delayed Departure of Spring&quot; - also related to divorce. She has been paying attention to emotional topics for a long time. She liked to post emotional jokes on the Internet from time to time many years ago. She has written most of the program copywriting for &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; and &quot;Spring Departs Again&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is the summary of Liu Le&#39;s more than ten years of experience in the industry, which combines the touch and sensitivity of a traditional journalist, the entertainment and dexterity of a variety show director, and the sharpness and sharpness of an emotional blogger. As a single woman, she has pushed many married people to take a step forward in their exploration of marriage and intimacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the show was broadcast, Liu Le received more concern and support than expected. Some colleagues even wanted to get married after reading it. Hu Yanbin, a guest in the observation room, told her: &quot;If parting is not so terrible, and we still have such deep care for each other, such good wishes, and such a decent separation, then I would also long for marriage.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《 After the recording of the third season of &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; ended, Liu Le accepted an exclusive interview with us and talked about the joys and sorrows related to the show in the past three seasons and the subtleties of human nature she has explored. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Can&#39;t we get a divorce without quarreling? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; reaches its third season and is still touching What&#39;s yours? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What shocked me the most this season was the sense of blamelessness between Seoul and Lao Liu. Before coming to Seoul, tell me, is it okay if I don’t quarrel? I said that whoever said &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; would quarrel, and if there is no quarrel, there will be no quarrel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we went to the Civil Affairs Bureau, the director asked why we couldn’t survive. What happened? Are you not going home? Was it drinking? Did he hit you? He has a lot of &quot;clinical experiment&quot; experience, and the questions he raised are very valuable. When we hear about other people’s divorce in our daily lives, we also ask what questions there are. If he said that there was no problem, why would he divorce? Good days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inertial thinking of many people is that I have to have an affair, have a violent family, and have to defraud me of money before I can get divorced. no. So our main concept this season is dull pain and slow growth. I can&#39;t tell you exactly what it is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the first few episodes were aired, you may have thought that you were complaining for no reason, that you were forcing yourself to express your sorrow, and that you just made up a set of words just to be on the show. Like Seoul, in the first half and second half of the broadcast, I read some public accounts and wrote from the beginning that Fu Seoul must be here to make money, and she will definitely not get divorced. After a few episodes, another public account wrote that Fu Seoul must be here to make money, because she had already planned to leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How people will recognize her is also the most difficult part to convince Seoul. Everyone will doubt whether she is motivated by utilitarianism. I told her, if you are willing to face your real dilemma, come. This sound will never dissipate. The most important point for persuading her is that she has real emotional demands. The marriage of more than ten years has truly taken root in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have known her for several years. When I was still in &quot;Happy Camp&quot;, she came to be my guest. She said that I am particularly envious of your state, a state where you can fall in love at any time. I said, did you encounter any confusion in your marriage? Chatted with her a bit. After doing &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, she often sent me some comments after watching the first two seasons. I felt that what she said actually brought her own personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seoul is very defensive. She will protect herself, but she wants to speak, but she won’t speak very thoroughly. She looks happy and cheerful, but there must be a lot of devastation in her heart buried under the surface of her wanting to make everyone happy, and I really want to dig this thing out. I mentioned it to her after the second season ended, and there must have been a process of persuasion. I told her that as long as you make up your mind, nothing will happen. The problem is a problem, but it can be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My judgment is that she will face it sooner or later. I am not saying that she must come on the show, but she has many knots in her heart that cannot be relieved by chatting with friends. On the one hand, she wants to seek change, and on the other hand, she also longs to be understood by more people. She still has the &quot;old script&quot; part to a large extent. I have been married for more than ten years and no one has made any mistakes. We have all tried our best. Why can&#39;t we live well? If so, can we choose to separate? I feel that she and Lao Liu are both in a trapped state. She can&#39;t really reconcile this matter, so much so that she is willing to go on a show to reveal everything to everyone. The real situation is like this, then I Can it be understood? She is so eager to be understood. She is pioneering and conservative, active and passive. She is a very charming contradiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope that one day she can accept her real difficulties and not move forcefully towards another life. This may be easier, but Seoul is not an easy person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/l2mMKm7vnUfWoevoLlB9wzEMH9GCU4sFugv5gJIt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/l2mMKm7vnUfWoevoLlB9wzEMH9GCU4sFugv5gJIt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260011&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the third season of &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, six guests celebrated the 14th wedding anniversary of Fu Seoul and Liu Yi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Don’t separate easily, and don’t drag it out to death&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you find the other two pairs of guests? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The other two pairs signed up by themselves. Wang Shiqing signed up for the second season, but when I talked to her at the time, there were no such big conflicts as this season. This year, I feel much more profound. After we reopened from the closed state last year, we entered a dynamic that will bring many severe impacts. If the relationship itself is good, this dynamic has the potential to make you even better. If it is not good in the first place, it will fall apart faster. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shiqing has more job opportunities, and she obviously feels that she is stronger. Her connections and feedback from society have become extremely concrete. She really feels like &quot;I am flying high.&quot; &quot;. As for the person who wanted to hold me back, his actions became more obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Sleeping signed up after the second season. At that time, the many quarrels between Zhang Wanting and Song Ningfeng reminded her of herself. She felt that she also liked to curse people and was unhappy, so she filled out the registration form. When I first looked at their materials, I didn’t see as many problems as those presented in the show. In the first round of contact, many directors judged them to be trivial and the problems were too trivial. They didn’t seem to be worth analyzing in daily life, not so thought-provoking, and not so promising. Expansion space, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it possible that trivial things are really worth extending? Could the program team be trapped by the so-called desire to pursue quality? Is it that when we present intimate relationships, we are too obsessed with those things that are invisible, intangible, and unclear, while those things that can be clearly seen, touched, grasped, and can be directly judged as right or wrong? Are we all excluded? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s reflect on it. In the first season, Zhu Yaqiong expressed a lot of feelings, but in the end what people remember is that one-minute hug. Or implement it on specific events. Specific events can give people something to grasp, reflect on whether they have behaved like this, and better establish a comparative coordinate system, so we set them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many people say that &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is to rely on fierce quarrels to attract attention. No, the show group does not want to be endless. That thing makes people despair and suffocate. But since it’s a reality show, we can’t interfere once they start. It is impossible for us to go up and tell them to stop quarreling and make peace with me quickly. It is even less possible for us to tell them that you two can start quarreling now. This is ridiculous. All we can do is record it truthfully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What topics will the flying guests bring when they join, and what new projects can they do? We can invisiblely implant these into the journey to trigger changes in them. The others exploded without even knowing what game they would be in, and any one sentence made him angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look, Zhang Shuo sent a WeChat message to the best man at that time &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (In the first issue, Wang Sleepy and Zhang Shuo had a dispute over their marriage. They had a quarrel, and the two broke up. Later, they quarreled over other things. At this time, Zhang Shuo sent a WeChat message to the best man to try to ease the conflict with Sui Suo. His most real feeling at that moment was that it was a good thing to do. , it can definitely be undone: She was angry with me because of other things, and I immediately had to do something to make up for it. But precisely because he did these things, the audience intuitively felt that his model was to tear down the east wall to repair the west wall, and the demolition was not good, and the repair was not good, and the whole person was very perfunctory. Is this perfunctory social norm? yes. So it resonated the most. A quarrel can only make people watch the fun, but what can make everyone stay after the fun is the pain behind the quarrel. It’s a point of empathy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think Zhang Shuo still represents a very common phenomenon: I don’t need to achieve 100 points in this matter, I always control my efforts, just achieve 10 points, 20 points That&#39;s it, lay flat everywhere, whether it&#39;s work, socializing or love for him. Huang Zhizhong is right, he is very stingy with his energy. Now that I have paid 10 points of energy, if you don’t recognize the value of my 10 points, I will not be happy. Is this selfish? of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of the hot search for &quot;Mirror of Society&quot; posted by Zhang Shuo, I think the audience can also very intuitively feel how powerless such an emotional model is for contemporary young people. Why do so many people not want to fall in love? Everyone said that I don&#39;t need to be so full, if love is not deeply loved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Zhang Shuo has many advantages. We are angry at him, but we cannot hate him. He is indeed a very kind-hearted child who is very considerate of the emotions around him. But why is this the pattern in intimate relationships? It’s been explored in the program, and it’s also being talked about in the observation room. (One of the reasons may be) People crave positive feedback, which is a physiological mechanism. If I make a mistake, do I want to get some advice instead of being asked if I am wrong? No one likes to be whipped all the time. After being whipped, I may do worse. This is a behavioral mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are many words &quot;Sleep, sleep and run&quot; in the program barrage. No one can understand why the two of them are still together. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the audience has directly seen a presentation, and they will think that since this is the case, why don&#39;t they break up? But as far as Suisie is concerned, this person is my first love. We have been together for 10 years. He used to be very good to me. It is not easy to decide to break up. When encountering problems, I must first think about how to solve them. What has changed? Can I change it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People must have hope, this is a very positive thing. Most people in the past went to the other extreme. No matter how hard, how tired, how many grievances we suffered, we had to live this life and never get divorced. Now the new trend is: if something is slightly wrong, say goodbye immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; has always wanted to find a middle balance, neither to separate easily nor to drag it out to death. We hope to have the ability to leave and repair. Maybe this is a healthier love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that for Wang Sleepy, when she decided to appear on the show, she just wanted to give the relationship one last chance. If it works out well, she will continue it, and if it doesn&#39;t, she will break up. In this process, every wavering, anger, and softening of her heart is extremely sincere. She is trying to re-recognize this person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After the program was broadcast, Zhang Shuo’s behavior caused a lot of controversy controversy. What was his feedback? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;He is in pain. I feel like my self has been completely shattered and completely denied. During the broadcast, he would come to discuss with us from time to time, basically introspection, which I found very difficult. No one can really quickly admit that they are a terrible person. This is a cruel thing and takes time, but we see that Zhang Shuo has been working hard. He still has an exploratory attitude. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shuo is considered a very sunny person in the show, and he is quite able to have fun for himself. Whether these public opinions are correct or not, they have a great impact on him. He was in pain, but he had to admit that some of the comments might be quite reasonable. Just like when a person wants to digest a knife, a knife is already in the flesh. It is cutting my tumor. I scream in pain, but I have to endure it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nLyveKvA0eqTxGrsUpslEL6wyPrRU1fvAaZcq6UT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nLyveKvA0eqTxGrsUpslEL6wyPrRU1fvAaZcq6UT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260013&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; Season 3 guests Wang Sleepy (left) and Zhang Shuo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The strong men&#39;s weak comments on this season, this is your intention For that? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was not intentional. Usually we don’t save materials just because they have something in common. We discover that we can come up with something during the process of saving. The title of the first issue, &quot;Looks Beautiful,&quot; is the commonality we picked out. The three couples were all collected separately. From the massive amount of material about each of them, we came up with the point that our marriage may look good to outsiders, but in fact it is not. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for whether women are strong and men are weak, I think we are just providing a discussion angle. Maybe everyone will come to this conclusion after reading it. In fact, none of these three couples are absolutely strong women, and they also have weaknesses. So we discussed what is strong, is it economic strength? If there is only one dimension, it can be considered that the three pairs are all strong women and weak men. But what about the right to speak? What about the need to be loved? What about the sense of presence in marriage? What about ease and comfort? Who is the emotional superior? Returning to these dimensions, they may not be strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You just said that you hope this program will be a platform for exploration. This is The original intention of the show? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have this direction only by doing it. Every time we meet a couple and they come to our show, their behavior may be somewhat beyond the threshold: too manipulative, too insecure, too patient, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For all parts that exceed the threshold, we hope to make everyone realize that this is a bit beyond the limit and you can come back. We strive to stand in a safer area. But sometimes, when some problems occur, I hope that everyone will not think that this matter is such a big deal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now NPD&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(narcissistic personality disorder)&lt;/span>;, gaslighting&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(a means of psychological manipulation)&lt;/span>;, borderline personality and other terms often appear. When people encounter something, they may immediately make a conclusion. So what are the real meanings of these words? What is the definition of professional? Will there be any overkill? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have also been thinking about this question since the second season. Can we conclude that this person is a lunatic once his behavior exceeds our daily cognition? Or once we make a judgment on a person, will everything he says next be untrustworthy? I don&#39;t think so. Teacher Guo &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Guo Keyu)&lt;/span>; said in the first season: &quot;People have too many sides.&quot; I particularly agree with this sentence. . There are all kinds of people, including crazy, depressed, high-value, and low-value people. People themselves are complex and imperfect animals, but their desire to be loved is true. Everyone is equal in love and everyone is equal in intimate relationships. This is why &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; does not strictly distinguish between celebrities and amateurs. We put them all in one field for discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I read a review that said &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is like untying a Luban lock, making those that are not tight enough buckle tighter and letting those that are on the verge of falling apart fall to the ground smoothly, rather than violently dismantling or never untying them. Open, let’s find a final ending for all the shaky Luban Locks. I agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;No more shame when talking about intimate relationships&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;How did you come up with the idea of ​​doing such a show at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From an industry perspective, there was a vacancy in the divorce track. At that time, all major platforms were exploring divorce IP. In the existing domestic and foreign divorce IP, some problems have not been really solved. For example, what is the appeal? If you are divorced and you are put on a trip together, do you have any appeal? Or is this the appeal of a program? Is it a request to watch? If the character has no appeal, what is presented may be very empty and ungrounded. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The divorce cooling-off period is the key to why I think of this IP. It can be used as an appeal. The first people I target are couples who have entered a cooling-off period. We only have 30 days to see if we can get this order. In marriage, everyone may have thought about divorce countless times. Why? What actions did you take after thinking about it? Repair it, or ignore it? ...There are a lot of character dynamics that can be told here, and because the divorce has not really been completed, we still have room to explore. The guests in the third season should be said to be the most suitable for my earliest plan, and they are not finished yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first two seasons are also based on this idea. The people we choose are not cold at least in our judgment. If they are cold, there will be no stories to tell. It is not good to divorce for too long, preferably within two or three years. The two people still have some contact from time to time, and some people have even proposed getting back together, etc. There are still ties, demands, and some confusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In daily life, I see other people&#39;s affairs very clearly, but I can always put off my own affairs, and maybe they will get better again. Without a huge incident, it is not easy for people to start a knife in a relatively smooth and ups and downs. We are not aware of the deep-seated rifts. How can we have the strength to detect this? Who would take an X-ray to illuminate their emotions? Many people do it either out of fear, laziness or avoidance. That&#39;s almost enough. Why do you keep saying this? It&#39;s so pretentious. This is especially common among men in relationships. Is there anything to discuss? I&#39;m going out for a drink. I have many colleagues and the company has many things going on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Communication and communication are often a matter of two people, not a unilateral choice. If I tell others, I want to talk to my lover about the problems in our eight-year marriage, but He doesn&#39;t talk to me properly, so if I want to divorce him, others may say you are sick. But in the context of &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, no matter how small the issue is, it will be taken seriously, and everyone will discuss it. So how do you talk about this, and whether you should divorce your marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; focuses on many issues in intimate relationships. I took a magnifying glass to this area, and everyone said that your issue seems to be really worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is at least a starting point for people who are stuck in marriage, people who want to get married, and people who want to talk about these things but are embarrassed. I am no longer ashamed, I want to talk to you today. Chat, let’s communicate your neglect of me. I don’t think it’s very abrupt, I don’t feel ashamed, it’s healthy, it’s also a kind of courage, and it’s also a kind of bravery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why do most of the travel destinations chosen have beautiful scenery, but Somewhere relatively off the beaten track? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Choose these places because they look good. The original and natural beauty is very important. People should get in touch with nature when they are confused, but few people do this. The place we chose is because we hope to stay there for a long time, making it very difficult for them and allowing them to feel the vastness of the world and the insignificance of human beings. This is an intuitive psychological suggestion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nature still has a strong healing effect. We strive to create a high-purity (shooting) environment so that they can safely enter deep water areas to discuss. This process is not easy, the beautiful scenery is a short-term comfort, no matter what, they are a very, very brave group of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/G88G4ZHWNzmH6EHkOGMANJgGwKJAOQbYgcR9CwpO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/G88G4ZHWNzmH6EHkOGMANJgGwKJAOQbYgcR9CwpO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260017&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; Season 2&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Praise to love, praise romance&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have no marriage experience, and the sweetness and pain of marriage in daily life are very small. And really, how do you grasp these subtleties in a divorce show? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have to understand why he did this at this moment. Why does he feel this way? Why make such a judgment? It’s certainly not 100% empathetic, but in this process, what are the questions worth asking? These can be developed through training, which is asking questions about intuition. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it is a good thing that I have never been married. I have contacted some colleagues, and I heard that I was going to do this subject, and I especially wanted to chat with me. After talking with me, I felt that everyone was too focused on themselves, and it was easy to draw conclusions, &quot;What is marriage?&quot; With sentences like this, I I heard a lot during that time, and they were all very different. The only thing they had in common was that they all believed in their own judgment in marriage. At this time, I clear my mind. I don’t listen to anyone’s words. I only present the words of all of you as a sample. The sample can have many cores for the audience to summarize on their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If I already have a marriage, I dare not guarantee that I will say that this does not exist, because I did not encounter this situation in my marriage. This is too ridiculous and cut him. Not having an open mind is very dangerous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Love must come in all kinds of different forms. When I was doing the show, I would also look back on my past relationships and realize that I had made mistakes of one kind or another. This is a very interesting thing. You can see it clearly in others. When it comes to yourself, who is a perfect partner? So looking back at myself, I feel that love is a long-term lesson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I prefer that my views on emotions come from real emotions rather than from the show. I hope &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is an auxiliary, it should not be the main course. You have to feel the specific people and real people, not some truths. Fu Seoer is already very reasonable, and Wang Sleepy is also very reasonable, but why are they still not so happy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The program has progressed to this point, and the audience has also experienced a lot of laughter. . But laughter cannot offset the real pain in a marriage. What do you think the meaning of &quot;laughing&quot; is? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Pain is pain. If pain is downward, laughter is upward. It may increase a little energy to resist pain, or allow people to see the full picture of pain more clearly. Responding to pain with a smile is art. As Mu Xin said, a person who comes out of sadness with grace is an artist. This smile is a kind of generous. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fmMsEze0OeD4DDlhxS62rJ0TiM23umaiU2JTGhDs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;872&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fmMsEze0OeD4DDlhxS62rJ0TiM23umaiU2JTGhDs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260019&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; Season 1&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;South People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you come up with the program&#39;s slogan &quot;Goodbye is easy, goodbye is hard&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, I felt that young people gave up too easily. I used to like to persuade people to get sober, but when more and more people were saying that it was no big deal to get sober and give up, I realized that this might be a new trend. When we discussed it, Talk about bringing together these people who want to break up. Is the act of &quot;Let&#39;s talk again&quot; a bit old-fashioned and inconsistent with the current situation of young people: &quot;I always want to find new people&quot;? That&#39;s why we say goodbye is easy or hard, and we think of &quot;goodbye&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;, which in English are &quot;see you&quot; and &quot;see you again&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern people are too easy to see the flaws of others. They cannot enter the deep water area and always swim in the shallow water area. No matter how many people they come into contact with, they will all be the same after a few months, and they will miss the conversation very much. When we have been in love for several years, it seems that people receive different nourishment at that time. Nowadays, short videos are teaching you, &quot;You should be wary if he does this&quot;, &quot;If he doesn&#39;t say this, he doesn&#39;t love you&quot;... This kind of dismantling is very rough. There are still many unattributable parts in relationships. It would be a pity if everyone is influenced by these crude logics and thinks that we can just play on the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an era when you can get a lot of happiness without falling in love, it is an extremely romantic thing to fall in love. I hope I can sing (this kind of love and romance). In the past, people may have had many practical needs when getting married. I needed someone to face life with me. But now, it seems that mobile phones have solved everything. Even if we don’t fall in love or get married, everyone can live quite well. In such a situation, it is such a romantic thing to find intimacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think people still need to seek intimacy in this situation? What is the reason? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Le: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because it is really good. If you have been to that mountain, you will know that the scenery there is very good, but the mountain climbing The process is very tiring. I hope you won’t stop climbing just because you are tired. Don’t think that the most fun is on the ground. The ground is safe, relaxed, comfortable, and ok, but you don’t. I’ve been up there, so I don’t care about the scenery on the mountain. &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; shows everyone the rugged mountain road, but everyone can still climb their own mountain. Those who work hard will gain more scenery, this must be the case. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style = &quot;color: Orange &quot;target =&quot; _blank &quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style:oraange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: //feedx.run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广东最能生但也最多单身，四川离婚人数遥遥领先，趣说人口数据]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261460]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 17:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[保障性住房，如何让城市居民顺利安家]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261407]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 15:26:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Removal, replacement, and acquisition of existing housing...

According to the &quot;Historical Dictionary Series of the Communist Party of China&quot;, in order to straighten out the relationship between state-owned assets and establish and improve the state-owned assets management system in the process of reform and opening up, in November 1988, the state established the State-owned Assets Administration Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the Chinese Government website, in 1994, the State-owned Assets Administration became a national bureau (deputy ministerial level) managed by the Ministry of Finance. Its main task is to comprehensively manage state-owned assets within and outside the People&#39;s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1998, the State-owned Assets Administration Bureau was officially abolished. In the same year, the Large Enterprise Working Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was formally established. During this period, the management structure of state-owned enterprises changed several times until the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council was established in 2003. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the time of the organizational reform in 1998, Hu Jinglin entered the Property Appraisal Department of the Ministry of Finance, and then served as Director of the Economic Construction Department of the Ministry of Finance, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Finance, and Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the official website of the State Council Information Office, Hu Jinglin has long been engaged in state-owned enterprise reform and macroeconomic theoretical research and practical work.

In January 1994, China began to implement the reform of the fiscal and taxation system with the tax-sharing system as the core, which significantly increased the central fiscal revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the reform of the tax-sharing system, the State Administration of Taxation has successively had five directors, namely Liu Zhongli, Jin Renqing, Xie Xuren, Xiao Jie, and Wang Jun.
