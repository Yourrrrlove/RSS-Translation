In fact, this is a common problem among the middle class in various countries. Let’s analyze the lifestyle and spiritual feelings of the middle class in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Europe and the United States, the middle-class life seems to be very good. They can vacation overseas, live in a house with a garden, and build a swimming pool. In the United States, companies purchase commercial insurance for their employees. Even if there are elderly people or children at home, the burden is not large. Life in the American middle class seems easy and comfortable. However, this may not be the case. On Buzzfeed, an American news aggregation website, an American netizen summarized &quot;what is the middle class&quot;, defining it as a life experience unique to the middle class that neither the rich nor the poor understand. The experience was not that great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen summed it up like this: The middle class in the United States can take a vacation, but they need to be careful with their budgets, while the rich do not need to be careful with their budgets, and the poor do not take vacations; the middle class can buy a house, but they are struggling with what kind of house to buy and the loan, while the rich In many houses, poor people don&#39;t think about this at all; the middle class has double garages, but one of them is full of messy things and can only park one car, while the rich have large garages and storage rooms, and the poor have fewer cars and less stuff. ; The middle class has a lawn, but they need to mow it themselves, while the rich hire a gardener, and the poor have no lawn; the middle class goes to Costco to kill time and buy a large cart, but the rich are not interested in shopping at this level, and the poor cannot afford to go; Children have to bear heavy college loans, and the children of the rich have their parents to pay, and the poor can apply for various subsidies; middle-class families have various facilities, but they have to buy a complete set of tools to repair them themselves, because labor costs are very high in the United States, and the rich It doesn&#39;t hurt to hire someone to fix it, but the poor can&#39;t afford so much equipment...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, this netizen said three words: enough is enough. In fact, to a certain extent, the embarrassment of the American middle class is inevitable. Since we are middle class, we must be caught in the middle, neither above nor below. Compared with the lower class, it is more than enough. The middle class has got rid of material poverty and lives a relatively prosperous life. However, compared with the upper class, their abilities are limited, their desires are hard to satisfy, and they cannot take it easy like the truly wealthy class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of the times has deepened this feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the information technology revolution, although all classes of society lived on the same land, they were isolated from each other to some extent. Although the lower and middle classes also know about the life of the upper class, they only have a superficial understanding of it. The means of communication are only hearing and writing. Therefore, there is such a ridiculous cross-class imagination that &quot;the poles used by emperors and empresses to carry water are all made of gold.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the advent of movies and television, the lower class’s understanding of the life of the upper class has deepened. In the era of social media, this barrier has been completely broken by smartphones, Douyin, TikTok, and Twitter. Videos, live broadcasts, and real interactions all make cross-class showing off direct and intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People’s desire to consume is often influenced by the scenes they see on social media, movies, and friends circles. Those who exert influence are of course high-income people, and the goods they consume are regarded as symbols of &quot;accessible happiness.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This influence is dragging the middle class with their desire for a higher level of consumption. The middle class strives to imitate the lifestyle of the upper class, from clothing and diet to hobbies. The middle class can grit their teeth and save money to achieve expensive purchases such as pianos, horse riding, mountain climbing, and studying abroad. At the same time, this has also become a source of pain for the middle class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason is that the middle class feels more tax pain. The famous politician Benjamin Franklin once said a famous saying: &quot;In this world, the only things that cannot be escaped are death and taxes.&quot; For the poor, although they also have to pay taxes, such as consumption tax when shopping, but The welfare received by the poor is greater, and the net welfare received by the poor is greater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the rich, it is first of all more difficult for the state to collect taxes from them. There are many ways for rich people to avoid taxes, such as donating to charitable funds they set up and putting consumption into company costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, U.S. President George H.W. Bush signed a new law: levying taxes on high-end cars over $30,000, yachts over $100,000, valuable furs over $100,000, and private jets over $250,000. 10% &quot;luxury tax&quot;. The purpose of the luxury tax is to allow the rich to pay 10% more when buying a yacht, and the increased fiscal revenue can be used to help the poor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, although the wealthy can afford the 10% tax, their purchases are very flexible: they can buy yachts abroad and then bring them back to the United States as second-hand yachts. Moreover, they can no longer buy yachts, but take vacations, buy luxury watches and diamonds. But the yacht industry is not that flexible. It is impossible to switch to other products in the short term, and it is impossible for workers in the yacht industry to change jobs in the short term. As a result, taxes from the wealthy were not collected, but the U.S. yacht industry was severely damaged, causing industrial workers to lose their jobs. In 1993, President George H.W. Bush repealed the luxury tax on yachts, private jets and furs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, most of the middle class are engaged in mental work or manual work with basic skills, and mainly rely on wages and salaries to make a living. This makes their taxes easy to collect and easy to check. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, although the rich are richer and the absolute amount of tax burden borne by a single individual is higher, the number of rich people is very small. Therefore, for the country, the middle class is the largest tax base. A country&#39;s expenditures are all borne by the middle class, and the benefits the middle class receive are far less than the taxes they pay. More taxes are paid to support the poor and the state&#39;s expenses, which means that the consumption of the middle class is less than their own labor income. This also forms part of the source of pain for the middle class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The drag on consumption and the pain and burden of taxes will all lead to one result, which is the embarrassment of the middle class, thereby suppressing the fertility rate of the middle class. Of course, overall, the middle class invests more in education than the bottom class, and the quality of their offspring is also higher. From this perspective, making the life of the middle class easier is also a blessing for the country’s future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[外国游客飞无人机撞坏安阳文峰塔？当地称确有碰撞正了解详情]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258682]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some netizens claimed that “several Korean men were operating drones to photograph Wenfeng Temple in Tianning Temple, Anyang, Henan Wenfeng Tower was destroyed by a drone when the tower was being destroyed.&quot; On October 16, Anyang Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau responded to Nandu reporters saying that a drone did indeed collide with Wenfeng Tower, and the specific situation is still being understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/0e27823c9e8a08f33ef86bc33f78928f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1234&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/0e27823c9e8a08f33ef86bc33f78928f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254147&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Netizen posts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 15, some netizens posted, “Several Korean men operated drones to photograph the Wenfeng Pagoda of Tianning Temple in Anyang, Henan. Improper operation caused the drone to destroy the Wenfeng Pagoda. Crash a piece.&quot; Netizens questioned why drones could be flown inside the temple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters asked the netizen for details, and the netizen added, &quot;The incident happened on the morning of the 15th.

Nandu reporters called the Anyang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, but could not get through as of press time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned that the full name of the Wenfeng Pagoda is &quot;Anyang Tianning Temple Pagoda&quot;. According to the official website of the Anyang Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau, the Anyang Tianning Temple Pagoda is located in the ancient Tianning Temple on Dasiqian Street, Anyang City, Henan Province. The pagoda was first built in the second year of Zhou Guangshun (952) after the Five Dynasties, and was repaired in the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. In 2001, the Anyang Tianning Temple Pagoda was announced by the State Council as the fifth batch of national key cultural relics protection units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[火锅吃微微辣？广东人四川人湖南人都不服]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258603]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 21:25:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以色列的“不可能三角”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258710]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Be my enemy”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Igor ·Amir is still in prison. He is 53 years old and has been in prison for nearly thirty years. In the past ten years, lawyers have repeatedly applied for him to have his sentence commuted or even released from prison, but each time he was rejected. From November 4, 1995 to the present, many extreme things have passed away, and the title of &quot;the most dangerous person&quot; in Israel still belongs to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amir fired three shots with a semi-automatic pistol, staining Prime Minister Rabin&#39;s blood red that day. At that time, Rabin attended a rally in Tel Aviv&#39;s Kings Square. After speaking, he was about to get into his car when he was shot twice and his bodyguard was also wounded. After Rabin&#39;s death, King&#39;s Square was renamed Isaac Rabin Square. Even now when I walk there, I still have a strange feeling: not because I am immersed in sadness, but because of the monument in the square commemorating Rabin. The sculpture looks so strange: it looks like a pyramid frame composed of three huge triangular wooden fences, with the tip pointed to the ground, and it is all rusty red. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/jimLNhy65dBQ1iOPFmsQ6dymlgNkafRUoqioRDOS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/jimLNhy65dBQ1iOPFmsQ6dymlgNkafRUoqioRDOS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254180&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Orthodox Jewish ghettos are often messy and quiet, but this is where the hearts of the fanatical believers belong. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Ye Tui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously from 1993 to 1995, Amir completed his compulsory military service and was among the best in Israel. He studied law and computers at Bar-Ilan University. During this period, Israel, under the leadership of Prime Minister Rabin, negotiated peace with Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and signed the Oslo Accords. The conciliatory gesture angered the country&#39;s extreme right wing. Amir and his brother were both extreme right wingers and conspired to kill Rabin. In 1996, Amir was sentenced to life imprisonment, and the bodyguard who was injured outside was sentenced to six years. His brother Haggai was sentenced to 16 years in prison. After the arrival of the new century, the left-wing parties led by Rabin and Shimon Peres gradually declined. The right-wing has long occupied the leadership position in Israeli politics, but Amir has never been released from prison. However, after 2003, a Russian-Jewish woman named Larisa Trumpovler kept visiting him in prison. The two got married in 2005, and two years later, they got the child of love through in vitro fertilization, named Yi Nong. Amir has never been released from prison, and their union and offspring were all carried out with approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, when Larissa first started dating Amir, a 77-year-old man named Herz Frank followed her with a camera. Frank is a Jewish citizen who immigrated to Israel from Latvia in 1993. When Larissa appeared, he seemed to realize that the thing he most wanted to do in life had appeared. He wanted to find out about Amir, the man everyone talked about. How did the perverted and terrifying prisoner come to associate with Larissa? What’s more, I want to know what motivation Larissa had to plunge into a hair-raising and absurd love, waiting for someone who would be impossible to return to freedom under normal circumstances. man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is an absolutely public personal act, and he also obtained the permission of Larissa and other relevant personnel. Ten years later, Herz Frank died. His Russian friend Kravchenko obtained the video materials he shot and spent another two years making a documentary called &quot;Beyond Fear (&lt;span style=) &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;or &quot;Beyond the Fear&quot;, Beyond the Fear&lt;/span>;)》. The film is dedicated to Herz Frank, and it mainly presents his shooting experience. He also appears in more places than Amir and Larissa, but the killer Amir’s sinister expression is impossible for viewers to miss. , which is also the &quot;selling point&quot; of the film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All of this content is information that can be searched and compiled, including the public opinion disputes that arose when the film was released. Amir is still in solitary confinement and is prohibited from using communication tools. His brother had some conciliatory words after his release from prison, but Larissa and the rest of Amir&#39;s family have always refused to apologize for his actions. They just hate Rabin and the &quot;Oslo System&quot;, but now that Amir has become a father, Larissa has pushed this love story as far as they can. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/7C448riAw5rqKRk8qb6rrQXDepLwLDqaIOApjuEO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;575&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/7C448riAw5rqKRk8qb6rrQXDepLwLDqaIOApjuEO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254186&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Igor Amir&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rabin His death was a huge wound for Israel. He was deeply loved by the people of Israel. He was self-denial and devoted to public service throughout his life. After his death, he had only a meager birth. Israel has designated November 14th as the anniversary of Rabin’s assassination. Every year on this day, the Labor Party led by Rabin organizes an organization to commemorate him. The crowds at rallies always look back on the past and express their sorrow with silent solemnity. Every year passes. , the speeches of the labor leaders became increasingly concise, no longer talking about the original details in detail, saying only that &quot;we are proud to be members of Rabin&#39;s party&quot; and &quot;we will continue to fight to bring the country on the road to peaceful dialogue.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The left has been in a slump. Even if no one dares to take the initiative to release Amir, right-wing parties have always controlled the political situation and used their tough external voices to prevent people from having any illusions about peace again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more things, things that are more important than the ins and outs of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict that anyone can say a few words about, are being ignored. It’s a feeling of exhaustion from thinking and feeling. Every Israeli citizen who looks healthy and sunny is fighting some shadows; every young parent will shrink his smile when thinking about his children having to serve in the compulsory military service in the future; every young and handsome man who looks like he blends in with the tourists The soldiers all have a lot to tell about being attacked, bombed, and killed in action. The relationship between security and danger is not just an opponent, but a neighbor. This seemed to be a foregone conclusion when the Israeli army retook Jerusalem and occupied the West Bank and Gaza through the &quot;Six-Day War&quot;. A poem by Yehuda Amichai best expresses this tension:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;In the old days On the roof of a house in the city&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The washed clothes are hung to dry in the afternoon sun:&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The white sheets of a woman who is my enemy,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Used by a man who is my enemy&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A towel wiping the sweat off his forehead.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People who are &quot;enemies of me&quot; all lead normal lives. The peaceful forces have always emphasized this and have always wanted people to realize this, but the main militant faction has used the opposite narrative: Those who live a normal life are always hostile to me. In Israel, there is a stone erected on the roadside. The Hebrew words on it are about an explosion on a certain day of a certain year. You will know when you see several candle niches on a wall and long-withered garlands on the ground. A shocking and horrific incident occurred there. If there were toys, it would indicate that there were children among the dead. Not to mention that there are various memorial facilities related to the Nazi Holocaust of the last century. Some of them are just a photo wall or a name wall, which you will encounter if you are not paying attention. After various encounters, you will feel that such a small country accommodates too much sadness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Israelis will tell you that the worst enemies come from within ourselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/afLJyhAYjNC7hOz4xJjxGWeAIgiG06N4wISvluJe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/afLJyhAYjNC7hOz4xJjxGWeAIgiG06N4wISvluJe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254178&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This is a sculpture commemorating a group of Israeli soldiers who were killed in a suicide attack. Among the many stele sculptures in Israel, it is one of the few with a relatively &quot;high-profile&quot; shape. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Enough blood and tears”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;There are no memorial buildings in Israel that can only be admired from a distance and cannot be approached. In Rabin Square, people can walk casually under the big triangle and pass through the shadows cast by the frames on the ground on a sunny day. Some children who are good at climbing on the fence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is impossible to see the meaning of this sculpture at a glance, and there is no unified explanation. Just as people&#39;s views, opinions, and attitudes towards Rabin&#39;s death are too diverse to form any natural consensus. Rabin is a good man, and in a 2006 national opinion poll in Israel, he was more revered than founding father David Ben-Gurion and topped the list of &quot;most beloved Israeli Jews.&quot; He was also an outstanding soldier. As Chief of Staff of the National Defense Forces, he played a major role in the victory of the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; in 1967. He was also an excellent diplomat. After the war, he proposed to the then Prime Minister Levi Eshkol to be the ambassador to the United States. Eshkol thought he had heard wrongly. The prime minister was famous for his humor and he was very fond of Latin America. Bing said: &quot;What? You say you want to stand in those long cocktail parties and sit in those annoying banquets? Are you willing to play those boring diplomatic games that diplomats have to play?&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/Le2uKYuHBFYILdHnzB4LJIt3l47LY65pcSUupYrx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot; 628&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/Le2uKYuHBFYILdHnzB4LJIt3l47LY65pcSUupYrx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254187&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rabbin in his youth&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Rabin wanted to What&#39;s more, the heightened hostility in the Arab world after the disastrous defeat of the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; will inevitably make Israel face a greater threat. The world was split in half during the Cold War. The Soviet Union stood behind the Arab countries. During the &quot;Six-Day War&quot;, Syria, Egypt and Jordan all relied on Soviet arms. So whose support should Israel seek? Of course it&#39;s the United States. Eshkol knew very well that Rabin, who never spoke any official language, became an ambassador for the benefit of the country. After Nixon won the election, Rabin often traveled with the newly appointed Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and became a celebrity in the White House. Not only that, as a core figure of the left-wing Labor Party, he also told his political opponent, the right-wing leader May Nachem Begin said how important diplomacy is to the country: When I do diplomatic work, I must use the adversarial relationship between the Democratic and Republican parties to promote Israel&#39;s interests, otherwise I might as well pack up and leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/UXp8jodD1S9kyotAeIxrHrNcnEY2xwon3rPshyRM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;528&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/UXp8jodD1S9kyotAeIxrHrNcnEY2xwon3rPshyRM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254183&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rabin and Clinton&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The close relationship between the United States and Israel It goes without saying how important connections are to Israel. However, after the 1986 Palestinian uprising known as the first &quot;Intifada&quot; in history, Rabin gradually realized that when the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; enabled the country to take over the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, it also took away these lands. The 1.7 million Palestinians brought in together. What to do with these people? What are their identities? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Rabin was the defense minister. He convened a group of left-wing writers and poets to learn about the situation of the Palestinians. Among these literati are Oz, AB Yehoshua, and David Grossman. They all believe that blindly ignoring the existence of Palestinians will make the country never have peace. Yehoshua often said with pride afterwards: No head of state would consult a writer on national policy. Rabin joked many times: Every Israeli is teaching me how to be prime minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/6qkFnYgSHnL33IplsswbR2zIJ9r6HOxvf74VIXTv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;675&quot; height= &quot;455&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/6qkFnYgSHnL33IplsswbR2zIJ9r6HOxvf74VIXTv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254185&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Grossman, AB Yehoshua, and Amos Oz are the iron triangle of Israeli left-wing writers. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Yehui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then to the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1994, Rabin firmly transformed from a war hero Transformed into a peacemaker. In August 1993, Rabin stood side by side with Arafat at the White House and delivered a famous speech entitled &quot;Enough Blood and Tears, Enough.&quot; After that, the management power of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was considered to be Officially handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Looking back at that time, people may think that &quot;land for peace&quot; was indeed the aspiration of the people in Israel at that time, but in fact, from the conclusion of the Oslo Accords to November 4, 1995, the Israelis were completely divided and targeted Protests and petitions against Rabin and the peace agreement continue one after another, month after month; even a bystander who knows nothing about Middle East affairs and only subconsciously agrees with &quot;peace&quot; will realize that this country Something serious has gone wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every anti-Rabin person regards himself as the master of the country, and what he says is usually intellectual. Those far-right Jews who have occupied a settlement in the desolate West Bank are only &quot;abominable&quot; and &quot;unreasonable&quot; in the eyes of rational people, but they are not &quot;ignorant&quot;. Everyone has knowledge and can defend their position eloquently. If a person holds a Bible in his hand and talks about the relationship between the Jewish nation and this land for three thousand years, you will definitely feel that he is very knowledgeable. On the other hand, another person, such as Shlomo Sander, the author of the &quot;Fictional Trilogy&quot; and a professor at Tel Aviv University, opened his mouth to refute the various narratives accumulated around the &quot;Holy Land&quot; and argue that &quot;Semiticism&quot; His origins and debunking the myths created by Zionism in the past hundred years, you will definitely be convinced by him, and perhaps deeply moved by his courage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The atmosphere of debate can be seen everywhere and can be felt since childhood. Children who grow up here learn early on that politics is not a &quot;meat-eater&#39;s plan&quot; but an urgent matter, and any stone with something written on it is a reminder to people to think about something. A person&#39;s habit of having an opinion on everything stems not only from the spiritual tradition accumulated by ancient scriptures and scripture interpretations, but also due to the &quot;oppression&quot; of the public opinion atmosphere. A person must not only form and demonstrate his own position, but also try to refute it. Seemingly profound philosophical creeds such as &quot;the opposite is the movement of the Tao&quot; are often just common sense in practice here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, politics is not a mental exercise. It requires people to take a stand. As a result of the peace talks and agreements, the atmosphere of hostility suddenly escalated. The official order to withdraw from the occupied territories ignited the hatred of the Jewish settlers there towards the Palestinians, and also made them full of anger towards the Israeli soldiers who came to dismantle the settlements. The confrontation between Israeli military police and black-robed Jews produced many photos that can be recorded in the history of photojournalism. They not only showed the extreme anger of extreme fanatics, but also engraved the internal divisions of a country where everyone is patriotic. Martin Gilbert tells the story of the first extreme suicide attack after the Oslo Accords in &quot;History of Israel&quot;: On January 22, 1995, 20 Israeli soldiers were killed in a series of explosions near Netanya. Die, that&#39;s the work of jihadist groups - no party seems to be satisfied with &quot;peace,&quot; and dissatisfaction can easily escalate into violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/wdrHPnQ4Es3D5ekZcrkLTFrrTnWRCxIm3GY0O4fk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/wdrHPnQ4Es3D5ekZcrkLTFrrTnWRCxIm3GY0O4fk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254182&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Common expressions of Palestinian boys in the West Bank. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Yehui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rabin used countless speeches to convince the people of the need for peace, but for the warring faction , the peace faction is always surrendering, ruining the future of the nation, and all the contributions Rabin has made to the country in the past can be wiped out. Does he understand this? Did he have a premonition that he was shot minutes after his last speech? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I feel more and more that Rabin’s death was a self-sacrifice: he had been willing to go among the people all his life, not guarding against the crowds surrounding him, and facing them with his shy and blushing face. Eyes of love or hatred. He probably understood that only his own blood could temporarily appease the excited emotions of all parties and interrupt the peace project he was trying to create, perhaps based on fantasy. He must use his own ending to serve as a warning to future generations: He would rather fight to the death with foreign enemies, and would rather spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build the most technologically advanced national defense system, than do so within the country (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To be precise, it is to cultivate enemies within the Jewish people&lt;/span>;) and stimulate those who have different political views to take action with weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xERYwpe2Vyv2xIHNBNTzU1IARVmlxPt8S1bA31Xu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xERYwpe2Vyv2xIHNBNTzU1IARVmlxPt8S1bA31Xu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254181&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the Old City of Jerusalem, you can see many people who do not seem to belong to the &quot;Jewish state&quot; of Israel. From this, you may have an idea of ​​the meaning of the &quot;Holy City&quot; comprehended. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Yehui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;He is a tragedy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; There are many tragedies caused by &quot;historical issues&quot; that will fade away with the passage of time. The most typical ones are the riots and wars in Algeria that started in 1952 and ended twelve years later, and the war in Afghanistan that started in 1979. It also lasted for ten years. These past events seem to have been turned over, and salvaging them is also the work of some writers and researchers who believe in humanitarianism. In particular, the pain they caused at that time was not universal. For many French and Russians, Tragic things are far beyond one&#39;s perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in Israel, where the space is small, and in the ancient city where the enemy is drying laundry opposite one&#39;s home, nothing will really turn the page; events are always current events, not a repeat or replica of what happened back then. Prepared for it: prepared for calm to enter the bomb shelter, prepared for sadness at the news of the killings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shlomo Sander once told me that the direct impetus for him to write &quot;The Fictional Jewish Nation&quot; was his sympathy for the situation of Palestinian students who were struggling in this country. Lack of &quot;at home&quot;; Sander deeply understands their pain. In this book, he demonstrates that the Palestinians who were driven out at that time are the true descendants of the ancient Israelites in the &quot;biblical era&quot;. He also said that the apartment where his home is located was a Palestinian village before the establishment of the state of Israel and had its own Arabic name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course Sander will not take the lead in exiting his own house. He was just doing what a scholar should do. Although he has endured attacks, reviles and even life threats from his enemies on the right, Sander is not alone. In Israel, he and others of all stripes continued to think, write, and publish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Democracy is also the biggest concession that Israel has made for its &quot;occupied&quot; land. In other &quot;one land, two peoples&quot; cases, horrific ethnic cleansing has occurred, but not in Israel; despite Zygmunt Bauman&#39;s sneer that there can be no enlightenment as long as there is occupation, Israel has sent troops in the past When suppressing Palestinian unrest, tanks were never fired at surrounding crowds. Tragedies have occurred when countries such as Syria, Jordan, and Algeria suppressed rebellions. Making this kind of comparison now feels a bit &quot;excessive&quot;, but it is also different now than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/gsKDXkKztV2yZeInYf2wcWViMJqrQwJTyj2qg6BN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/gsKDXkKztV2yZeInYf2wcWViMJqrQwJTyj2qg6BN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254179&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Israeli mother and child&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a &quot; The &quot;Impossible Triangle&quot; stands at the center of Israeli politics, with its three corners being land, security and democracy. Israel has wanted all three since 1967, but in fact it can only get two: if it wants land and democracy, it means sacrificing security; if it wants democracy and security, it must give up land; if it wants security and land, it Democracy must be abandoned, that is, the civil rights of non-Jewish people in the current population must be denied, and all voices of internal and external dissatisfaction must be silenced. This triangle can be used to explain the strange sculpture commemorating Prime Minister Rabin: Rabin decided to give up the land for the sake of security and democracy, and died here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let people freely &quot;pass&quot; the unstable inverted triangle and feel its meaning. This design also reflects the principle of democracy. When talking about Rabin with older Israelis, they will all say, &quot;He is a tragedy.&quot; But what kind of tragedy it is, and what is right and wrong, they won&#39;t say. It’s not that they dare not say it, but that they have long accepted all arguments about it. This is their way of understanding the tragedy and then moving on. Life is about &quot;passing&quot; every event and moment to form your own experience and your own thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/f9hLCsRfEcEHcR5MnF9SN7OzMZm8pEOG4l3ek3bW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/f9hLCsRfEcEHcR5MnF9SN7OzMZm8pEOG4l3ek3bW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254184&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Karavan&#39;s work &quot;The Road to Peace&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The sculptor Dani Karavan, who died two years ago, created many profound works in Israel’s deserts, cities and borders.

&lt;p>;望着眼前这个有点社恐、口吃的同龄人，秦潇越察觉他的表达中有很强的戏剧张力。房君睿说，做文物修复工作需要一定经济基础，他觉得家里条件不足以支持自己，但同时，也很自豪他们家在上海静安寺边上有一套房子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦潇越和摄影师带着摄像机进入这个家庭。那是一套30平米的老公房，85后房君睿与年过七旬的父母蜗居在此。最大的房间是客厅，也是房君睿的卧室，有一张床、一张餐桌、一张父亲看电视的躺椅。房君睿不断购入的艺术、宗教、文学书籍，塞满了家具间的罅隙。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/nLfPZpNxPpSyvbnEnr1Z1qlv5M4Kk9o9uWXdqP95.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height=&quot;1346&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/nLfPZpNxPpSyvbnEnr1Z1qlv5M4Kk9o9uWXdqP95.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254135&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;观念上的分歧与生活上的依赖，是房君睿（中）与父母的日常。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;房君睿受喜爱书画的父亲影响颇深，上大专时选择了文物修复专业。毕业后，父子俩发现这是一个需要高学历、强大资金支持才能做的行业。2014年毕业后的两年里，房君睿不仅未能找到对口工作，找到的其他工作也没有一份做满三个月。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父亲继续支持房君睿，帮他支付高昂的学费，报名参加文物修复大师班，房君睿断断续续上着，也在修一只碗，但一直没修好。不断碰壁，吞噬了房君睿的希望，他陷入消沉、忧郁，耽于纯粹的幻想，过着日夜颠倒的生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;房君睿的父亲年轻时，也没过上自己想要的生活。他喜欢画画，但没能以此为业；诗歌和文章都写得不错，却长期郁郁不得志。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦潇越本来预设，把一个热爱文物修复的男生的心路历程拍出来。但刚踏进他们家门口，她就感觉这种期待完全落空了。镜头像是火柴，点燃了他们压抑多年的矛盾。前几次拍摄，除了争吵，几乎拍不到什么内容。片子的走向完全改变了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月16日，广州映后谈，一名观众问起《巢》的命名原因，在他的理解中，“巢”更接近人们对于美好家庭的想象，但影片展现了被困住的一家人，令他想起的是“笼”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“巢不单单是一个很温暖的家庭的感觉，还有一种一直生活在父母羽翼之下的感觉，还有总归会幻想他什么时候可以离巢的期待。”秦潇越回应，“他的精神世界也是一个巢，他拿这些书，构建了他精神世界的巢，和现实世界的巢产生了非常大的反差。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xmmNdStZYSWXd9bozcBbEz9YRx1Qq9If6NXgrhGy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xmmNdStZYSWXd9bozcBbEz9YRx1Qq9If6NXgrhGy.jpg&quot;

&lt;h4>;三角形&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;拍摄这个家庭时，秦潇越想探索，同住一个屋檐下的人明明互相伤害、折磨彼此，是什么让他们继续生活在一起。在与南方周末记者的访谈中，她透露了心中答案：“可能他们拥有的很少，只拥有彼此，如果连这个也丢掉，就一无所有了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三口人很少出门旅行，社交圈亦窄。除了母亲偶尔会去走亲戚，多数时候，他们在小家里终日相对。秦潇越用“稳定的三角结构”形容这个家庭，“每个人都是又依赖又备受折磨”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;东亚家庭里普遍存在的否定式相处在代际间传递。房君睿的爷爷年轻时因得罪狱警，进了监牢，父亲因此非常看不起爷爷；父亲“文革”时遇上“下乡运动”，需要到边疆去，动员的人一来，他就逃，形成了喜欢逃避、怕事的性子，所以房君睿也看不起父亲。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而父亲经常用打压的方式和房君睿沟通。当房君睿抱怨找不到理想工作时，父亲会说，自己当时遭受到那么多不公，条件那么艰苦，还是走过来了，还在坚持画画，他指责儿子不努力，整天只知道睡觉，不去争取。房君睿谈到自己的阅读范围，说雕塑也是感兴趣的方向之一，父亲劈头一句：“雕塑？你懂雕塑吗？你懂啥？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这令房君睿在本就狭小的家里更感窒息，他在镜头前好几次崩溃，乃至以自杀相要挟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可与此同时，生活中的照顾却无微不至。每个月，房君睿都能拿到父亲给自己的三千元钱。在自己需要时，符合心意的食物、干净的毛巾总会递到他手上。拆书的包装随手扔在地上，也会有人帮忙捡起来。虽然煎熬，房君睿始终没有选择离开父母，独自生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有人看完《巢》，和秦潇越分享自己的理解：父亲在社会上一辈子没拥有过什么存在感，因此要在教育儿子这件事上去弥补。他试图给家里收养的猫立规矩，可挨打后的猫并没有被驯服，还是照样在饭桌上淡定踱步。房君睿也对父亲的耳提面命“免疫”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对镜头，母亲没有父子俩那么强烈的表达欲，大多数时候，她都在默默操持家务。收养的猫来来去去，母亲喂猫粮时，亲昵地、逐只呼唤她给它们起的名字。“好像妈妈一直是有无限的关怀的一个人，她其实大部分时间怨气都是往肚子里吞的。”秦潇越记得，拍摄后期，也许是因为镜头的存在，房君睿的母亲把委屈全部吐露了出来，用手指着镜头，“你让他们评理”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;房君睿的母亲一次在气头上对父子俩说，她要离开他们，自己去旅游，最终却还是落回到“你们都不去，我就不去了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/oHoWXRS2kU0yhyYIHBRaK0XY0aGSqqpoY0EefXS1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/oHoWXRS2kU0yhyYIHBRaK0XY0aGSqqpoY0EefXS1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254132&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;房君睿的母亲。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;片中，房君睿母亲透露了一件往事，房君睿上初中时曾要求养一只小狗，父亲没同意。她认为，自从这件事后，本来伶俐的儿子“脑子转不过来，坏掉了”。40多岁的两人老来得子，对房君睿宠溺万分，尤其是父亲，对他从小几乎是有求必应。秦潇越猜测，在这件事上，房君睿未得到满足，不能站在其他人立场去考虑问题，不能接受父亲的拒绝，性情可能变得偏执。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦潇越有一个比她小十多岁的弟弟，也深受父母宠爱，她有时会以此警示父母。“但我觉得从父母的角度来讲，有的时候好像也没办法，他们就是被自己的小孩拿捏。太在意一个人的时候你就不好掌控了，生活就会越来越失控，失控到一个无法解决的地步，然后痛苦地在一起。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;镜头的出现，让一家人把积压已久的情绪爆发出来，也暴露出在教育儿子的问题上父母截然不同的态度。房父还想借助镜头拉儿子一把，让他觉醒、改变，母亲则认为说了也没什么用，再在镜头前刺激他，只会更加让他想不开。在纪录片结尾，母亲说了一句，把老房子卖了，也够儿子吃一辈子。父母对于房君睿的态度像两股相向刮来的风，互相抵消了力量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;房君睿辞掉保安工作后，去做空气检测。母亲向父亲嘀咕：“空气检测是不是要一直站着，会很辛苦。”父亲直言：“你这人好奇怪，一边担心他吃不了苦，现在又怕他吃苦。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他在这样子的环境下很适应的，就这样自己做自己的，每天有人照顾他吃穿。关于觉不觉醒、人生的意义、生命的动力，这种很高谈阔论的东西落回到每一天的日程，就还是变成吃小馄饨，烧饭，一日三餐。”秦潇越对南方周末记者说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑到房君睿以后可能要结婚，二老在远离市中心的嘉定买了一套经济适用房。前不久，他们刚把房君睿的书搬到新房里去。秦潇越希望将来能拍下房君睿或他父母搬离老房子的镜头，那意味着，这个家庭的稳定结构极有可能出现突破口。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;两代人&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;房家祖上曾拥有风光的昔日，民国时期，房君睿的曾祖父辈迁至沪上，开黄包车公司，做买办，过起了他人艳羡的生活。日军入侵上海时，他们家族从虹口逃难至苏州河沿岸，在波涛诡谲的时代几经浮沉，到房君睿父辈这代，彻底没落。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与逼仄、灰暗的物理空间形成鲜明对比的，是这一家人的精神世界。父亲爱画画，会写近体诗，母亲也读繁体竖排的诗词，房君睿耳濡目染，承袭了对文史、艺术的兴趣。当初房君睿高考，还是父亲首先在报考专业中发现了“文物修复”。他把每个月的工资和父亲给的钱都用来买书，和教友谈起天主教中的文化艺术，头头是道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在秦潇越看来，房君睿与父亲的命运是“很雷同的，平行的”。房父从小喜欢画画，但没有机会从事相关工作，有二十年的时间，他在公共浴室做服务员。不过他始终没有放弃这份爱好，有时间就在家里画，当人才可以流动的时候，他跳槽到医院当美工，主要工作内容是出黑板报。一直等到40岁分配到了房子，他才开始考虑结婚生子。他常把类似的话挂在嘴边：“有多少人能真的过理想的生活？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不似父母那代人可以随遇而安，房君睿毫不掩饰自己“生不逢时”之感，他为自己坎坷的生活找到了一个怪罪的落脚点，幻想自己如果物质条件优渥，便可以从事文物修复，顺利结婚生子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在父亲的观念里，没有条件，没有房子的话，还谈什么朋友，结什么婚？而房君睿觉得，有房子住，可以结婚，是每个人都应该实现的基本需求。“难道只有有钱人才能结婚吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/4pw8RKm9m8gWpUK751TTxThDO734K3g89DSUOZRg.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;房君睿（右）与父亲（左）就个人遭遇争论。纪录片《巢》剧照。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（片方供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘汶蓉分析：“父亲和他有相似的个人理想，对事业和审美、艺术的追求上有相同之处，但是因为成长的社会发展阶段不同，选择了不同的人生道路。父亲把生存放在第一位，儿子却在自我实现和理想追求道路上不妥协。他们这个巨大的冲突就是那些不团结的、不和谐的&#39;啃老&#39;家庭共同的特点——价值观上无法契合，两代人的工具性支持就成了情感捆绑、道德绑架。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这对父子在同年龄段遭遇相似的命运——由于各种因缘，他们都没能过上自己理想的生活。但两人之间并未惺惺相惜，反而筑起高墙。房父以自己的人生经历激励房君睿，后者完全不吃这一套，觉得没有什么了不起的。而在房父眼里，房君睿生活完全不能自理，文物修复只是好高骛远的空谈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦潇越指出，房父经历过的动荡年代，把他的生活面貌、对于生活的感觉、整个内心秩序都摧残了。这导致他几乎所有认知、表达方式都是消极保守的。而房君睿与许多同代人一样，“没有经历过什么很大的痛苦，见证的是祖国发展最迅猛的阶段，而且受到很多外来文化影响，机遇也更多，看到的可能性更多，不太会为自己设限”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;房君睿与父母最大的区别在于，后者的生活处境是不干活全家没饭吃，前者则吃饱穿暖，工作更多是为了自我实现。当房君睿的抱负无法在社会上得到施展时，他既不愿、也不能像父母那样埋首于生存，接受平庸琐碎的人生。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;80后、90后的生活质量远高于父母一代，是两代人成长环境的核心变化，也是代际冲突的源头。类似房君睿与父母，代际之间的隔阂与认知差异是普遍的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“沟通很重要。当沟通没到位的时候，可能就会出现他们家这种情况。感觉他们是出于爱去讲这些话，但是这些话又完全到不了对方心里，关系就架在那儿了。”秦潇越说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦潇越也曾遭受过父母的否定。那时她从海外留学回来，坐火车环游中国，开始拍纪录片。在父母的想法里，女儿尝试过自己想做的了，就该老老实实找个班上，最好能进电视台、报社，稳定体面。不料后来秦潇越为《巢》折腾五六年，他们想不通女儿为何“又跳进了更大的坑”。后期制作时，她和父母起了矛盾，母亲对她说，“你再这样下去，也会变成房君睿的”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦潇越回望这一路，家人点滴支持都靠自己争取，如果有这方面的成绩，最能够打消他们的担忧，还没有成绩出来时，至少要有热情、行动力打动他们。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;影片陆续在上海、广州、杭州等城市放映，每一场，秦潇越都会接收到观众直接的共鸣，诸如想起了自己父亲讲话的方式，某个朋友的家庭也与之相似等等。这正是她期望的——观众能跳出对人物的指指点点，把片子当成一面镜子去映照自己身上的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;一只碗&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;房君睿一直没有修好那只碗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一次拍摄，父亲主动让他把碗展示给秦潇越他们看，鼓励他把这个碗修好，说不定大师觉得不错，愿意收他做关门弟子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二次拍摄，父亲在镜头前“戳穿”房君睿——如果他真的喜欢文物修复的话，这个碗老早就修好了。秦潇越顺着这话说，下次等他把碗修好再过来拍。房君睿眼神一变，直接表示，不可能通过他拍一部励志片。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/GY6u8OiCDlnQ6KS2IMfU1RXi2DpztTHqBwJYdyyX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/GY6u8OiCDlnQ6KS2IMfU1RXi2DpztTHqBwJYdyyX.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;《巢》的拍摄、制作周期远超秦潇越的计划。她觉得这部片子就是自己的那只碗。“你很想要做一个事情，也很擅长做这个事情，但是你却一直没有做出来，这种时候你就会觉得你的人生好像是失控的，你的人生道路不是你想象的样子，就会产生一种自我质疑。”在她看来，片子做出来，挺偶然，如果没做出来，她也会陷入很无助的状态，“如果很确定地说这个事情我就不做了，赶快转行，可能也没有那么痛苦。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;片子拿到Frist青年电影展最佳纪录片奖后，受到许多关注，其中不乏文物修复领域的工作者，秦潇越建议房君睿趁此机会把碗修好，好向关心他的人证明自己的能力。房君睿回应她，修好了又怎么样呢，而且自己现在完全没有时间。“其实工作也是有双休日的，他完全是沉浸在负面情绪里走不出来。”秦潇越说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;文物修复入行门槛高，通常需要读研，由导师引路。看过片子后，房君睿的大专同学告诉秦潇越，他们同学里，毕业后无人进入文物修复领域。房君睿尝试过包括房产登记、技术工人、医院安保等诸多工作，总是因工作能力、人际关系、个人意愿等原因难以持续。苦于收入与房子的问题，他也找不到对象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1970年代后期成长起来的刘汶蓉，观察到如今年轻人很难做到“脚踏实地”。这种心态的变化和整个社会信息环境密切相关，“网络、信息传播太发达，给人的无力感太强了——他参照的对象永远是最好的那一批人，没有办法对自己身边的人和事，包括对自己满意，活得非常不快乐”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;房君睿想过上一种更好的生活，并想象那样的生活存在于祖上的光辉岁月里。但他看不到眼前停滞的生活在短期内有松动的可能，失去了行动力。四五年光阴在屏幕上淌过，直到影片结束，几乎没有任何一件事得到解决，没有修完碗，没有找到合适的工作，家庭关系没有缓和，没有恋爱结婚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在遇见房君睿之前，秦潇越相信，每个人都应该过自己想要的生活。他打破了她的期待，始终不曾成为一个英雄式的人物。在纠结许久之后，秦潇越接受了这种失落感，接受了任何人都可以是一个平庸的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得像他爸说的没有错，你如果真的很热爱一个东西，其实是会去做更多尝试的，不会那么轻易地想要放弃，但是没有人可以真的做到感同身受，比如我现在这样说，对他来说是不公平的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她转而探究原因，试图用纪录片展现部分答案。片子剪了一个又一个版本，像一个个欲言又止的回答，现在的版本，涉及家庭、命运、理想等众多议题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“可能没有人能够说得清，（原因）是综合性的。他个人是有一定原因的，比如说他太脆弱了，太容易放弃，这跟他从小成长的环境、家庭关系有关，也跟社会环境有关，比如说他没遇到那种扶持自己去做这方面尝试的机会，没有衔接得很好的、培养自己的氛围。”秦潇越推翻了起初想拍一个郁郁不得志的理想青年的设想，“这些素材也够做一个短片出来。但我如果做那样一个片子的话，好像就忽略掉了他生命当中更重要的对他的影响。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;反氢原子（蓝色小球）在竖井里下落，同物质相遇发生了湮灭。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（美国国家科学基金会/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们生活在一个“物质世界”中，从宇宙到人体再到细胞，都是物质。但物理学家的研究表明，与物质相对应，宇宙中还存在反物质，他们对此进行了近百年的探索。 2023年9月27日，欧洲核子研究中心（CERN）的ALPHA合作组在《自然》（&lt;em>;Nature&lt;/em>;）上发表了一篇论文，公布了他们对反物质的最新研究结果。他们在实验中发现，反氢原子在引力作用下会自由下落，这和物质在引力作用下的运动方式相同。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ALPHA合作组发言人、丹麦奥胡斯大学物理学教授同时也是这篇论文的通讯作者之一的杰弗里·汉斯特（Jeffrey Hangst）表示：“这是首次直接在实验中观测到引力对于反物质运动的作用，在反物质研究的历史上是一个里程碑。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;反物质的谜团&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;1928年，英国物理学家保罗·狄拉克（Paul Dirac）提出了狄拉克方程，预言了反物质的存在。在他的理论中，存在一种粒子，除电性和电子相反外，其他所有性质都和电子相同，这种粒子后来被命名为正电子。 1932年，美国物理学家卡尔·安德森（Carl Anderson）在实验中发现了狄拉克预言的正电子，他也因此获得了1936年诺贝尔物理学奖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反物质被发现后，物理学家开始研究反物质的性质，并且思考反物质与引力的关系。 1915年，爱因斯坦提出了广义相对论，建立了迄今为止最成功的引力理论。从1919年的日食观测到2015年发现引力波，广义相对论的预言在一个世纪里不断得到证实，也经受住一系列实验的考验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在爱因斯坦提出广义相对论的时候，包括他在内的物理学家还不知道反物质的存在。但在广义相对论中，相同质量的物体受到的引力相同，而与它们的内在结构或性质无关。因此，物质和反物质受到的引力作用应该是相同的。过去的一些实验表明，引力对物质和反物质的作用效果相同，但这些实验都只能间接地证明这一点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数十年来，物理学家都希望通过直接实验来研究这个问题，ALPHA合作组此次完成的就是这样一次直接实验。在爱因斯坦之前，牛顿建立了成功的引力理论，他被落下的苹果砸中从而想出万有引力定律的故事可谓是家喻户晓。虽然这只是一个故事，但是物理学家在这个实验中希望研究的问题可以理解为：在一个由反物质组成的世界里，苹果还会掉下并且砸到牛顿吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;物理学家探究反物质在引力作用下的运动，还希望借此回答一个事关宇宙演化的关键问题。根据大爆炸理论，宇宙大爆炸发生时应该产生同等数量的物质和反物质，但是这些物质和反物质却没有发生湮灭而全部转化成能量，而且我们今天生活在一个几乎完全由物质组成的宇宙中。这被称为“正反物质不对称之谜”，是当今物理学中最大的谜团之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大部分物理学家根据广义相对论，相信反物质和物质在引力的作用下应该有相同的行为；但也有物理学家支持反重力理论，他们认为反物质在引力作用下不是向下掉落，而是反方向向上飞起。这样一来，在宇宙形成之初，物质和反物质在引力作用下就会向着相反的方向运动，经过138亿年的演化，我们今日所处的宇宙中就不会探测到反物质的存在，从而可以破解正反物质不对称之谜。因此，如果物理学家在实验中直接观察到反物质在引力作用下的运动和物质存在差异，就将获得解决这一难题的重要线索，甚至在物理学中引发一场颠覆性的革命。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;和牛顿最负盛名的“故事”一样，引力理论的先驱伽利略在比萨斜塔完成两个铁球同时落地的实验，从而推翻亚里士多德的落体定律，同样是一个后人杜撰的故事。不过，如果想研究反物质在引力作用下的运动，物理学家会很自然地想到可以用落体实验来考察反物质是否和物质遵循一样的引力定律。只不过，这个思路虽然理论上可行，在实验中却困难重重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在任何两个有质量的物体之间都存在引力。在已知的自然界的4种基本作用力中，引力是作用距离最长的力，因此在宇宙演化和天体相互作用中扮演着最重要的角色。但是，引力又是4种力中最弱的力，对质量极小的粒子而言，引力的作用效果可谓微乎其微。举例来说，对一个反质子而言，1V/m的电场施加的力的大小是地球施加的引力大小的40万亿倍。因此，如果使用带电的反物质粒子作为实验对象的话，几乎不可能完成检验引力作用效果的实验，研究人员只能选择电中性的反物质粒子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反氢原子是氢原子对应的反物质，由一个正电子环绕一个反质子组成。它既是最简单的反物质原子，又是电中性且稳定的反物质粒子，这些性质使得反氢原子成为研究反物质的引力行为的最佳选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，物理学家都是在实验室中获得反物质粒子。例如，在高能粒子碰撞中产生的粒子都是成对出现的，一个物质粒子对应一个反物质粒子。但是，把反物质粒子结合到一起形成反原子却非常困难，因为反物质粒子的寿命通常都非常短暂。当一个反物质粒子与对应的物质粒子相遇的时候，它们会发生湮灭，转化成能量。在一个由物质组成的世界里，反物质粒子很难相遇再结合成反原子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，虽然反氢原子是最简单的反物质原子，但目前世界上也只有欧洲核子研究中心能够制造反氢原子，物理学家在那里使用反氢激光物理仪器（Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus，ALPHA）对反物质进行研究。 ALPHA合作组的研究人员通过高速质子碰撞获得反质子。此后，一台名为ELENA的减速器可以将反质子的速度降到足够慢，以便物理学家进行下一步操作。在欧洲核子研究中心，有几个研究反物质的实验都依靠ELENA提供便于操控的反质子，其中就包括这次实验。与此同时，他们从放射源中收集正电子。接下来，他们把二者结合在一起，就创造出反氢原子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;下落的反物质&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在获得了反氢原子后，研究人员把它们推到一个3米高的竖井中，这个装置被称作ALPHA-g，其中“g”表示重力加速度。竖井的周围围绕着超导电磁线圈，从而避免反物质与物质接触进而发生湮灭。研究人员让竖井中较热的反氢原子逃逸出去，这样竖井中的反氢原子气体就会变得更冷，只比绝对零度高0.5℃。剩下的反氢原子以很慢的速度运动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接下来，研究人员逐渐减弱竖井顶部和底部的磁场，这就相当于打开了一个罐子的盖子和底部。当反氢原子逃逸出来并发生湮灭的时候，研究人员使用两台传感器来测量湮灭发生的位置。在实验中，他们一次在竖井里困住大约100个反氢原子，然后在20多秒的时间里，通过逐渐减小竖井顶部和底部磁铁中的电流的方式把反氢原子释放出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我们的日常生活中，如果打开一个气体容器的话，里面的气体会向各个方向逃逸。但是反氢原子此时的运动速度很慢，如果反物质和物质受到相同形式的引力作用，那么地球引力此刻就会产生明显的效应：大部分的反氢原子应该从底部逸出，少部分会从顶部逸出。计算机模拟显示，对于物质来说，这个操作将导致有大约20%的原子从竖井的顶部逸出，而大约80%的原子从竖井的底部逸出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究人员在这项研究中进行了7次实验，在每次实验中，偏置磁场的大小不一样，这个磁场既可以加强也可以抵消引力。通过将7次实验的结果进行平均，ALPHA合作组发现反氢原子从顶部和底部逸出竖井的比例与模拟的结果一致。经过计算，他们给出的反氢原子受到的重力加速度的值为0.75 ± 0.29 g，g是当地的重力加速度。因此，他们得出结论：在目前的测量精度范围内，反氢原子的加速同由地球引力引起的物质的加速是一致的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2010年，汉斯特领导的团队在历史上首次成功囚禁了反氢原子。 2016年，他们又成功测量了反原子如何吸收光线。但是引力实验的复杂程度前所未有，正如他所言：“这是到目前为止我们完成的最困难的事情。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然这次实验还存在一定的误差，但是研究人员认为，他们至少能够决定性地排除一种可能，即引力对反物质的作用是排斥的，也就是说，反重力理论不可能成立。由此我们能够确认：在反物质的世界里，苹果也是向下掉落，也许会砸到那个世界里的“牛顿”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ALPHA合作组计划在2024年进行更加精确的测量，精度将达到此次实验的100倍。汉斯特表示：“我们用了30年的时间学会如何制造反原子、如果使它们持续存在以及如何很好地控制它们，这样我们才能使它们在引力的作用下掉落。下一步是尽可能精确地测量这种加速。我们希望去验证无论是物质还是反物质都以相同的方式下落。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ALPHA合作组此次公布的结果是一个意料之中的发现，但正如汉斯特所说，这仍然是一项具有里程碑意义的成果。物理学是一门实验科学，以实验验证理论猜想正是其中最核心的部分。物理学家通过这项实验不仅验证了此前的猜想，也奠定了研究中性反物质的重要基础。在以此为起点开始的反物质研究中，也许会诞生一些意料之外的发现，从而改写我们对物质与反物质的形成和演化的理解，真正破解物理学中最大的谜团之一。 &lt;/p>;

We have been taught since childhood that it is a virtue to have the courage to face mistakes and correct them. However, in real life, some people regard virtue as a broom. Not only do they not correct their mistakes, but they also make them knowingly and add to their mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It rained in the afternoon, so I went to take the bus and found that the seat I wanted to sit in was occupied by a wet umbrella, so I had to find another seat. The same thing happened to the passengers who came up later. They wanted to sit in that seat but had to find another seat when they saw an umbrella. One of the old men had difficulty moving and had to stumble to the last row to sit down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sight of the old man walking with difficulty made people feel pitiful. An old man couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and asked the umbrella owner why he didn&#39;t pick up the umbrella. The umbrella owner explained that there were no other passengers when she got on the bus. She was answering the phone at the time, so she conveniently placed the umbrella on the seat. The old man continued to question, saying that the umbrella was wet and it was common sense not to put it on the seat. The owner of the umbrella argued that the seat was wet anyway and he couldn&#39;t sit on it. The two argued over and over again. After the surrounding passengers lined up for the old man, the umbrella owner suddenly changed her face and said arrogantly that she could put her umbrella wherever she wanted and that it was none of the old man&#39;s business. She also mocked the old man for not being able to afford an umbrella. Fortunately, the surrounding passengers reconciled the situation and the bus happened to arrive at the platform where the old man got off, otherwise a bigger dispute might have erupted between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the old man got off the bus, the old man sitting in the last row criticized him for being meddlesome, and some of his words were unpleasant. This really surprised the passengers. The old man obviously complained about the grievance when he saw that he was also an elderly man and had difficulty moving. Unexpectedly, he didn&#39;t appreciate it and even stabbed him. Seeing that someone was helping her, the umbrella owner talked about her reasons for letting the umbrella go, emphasizing that she had always been a rule-abiding person outside. She didn&#39;t shut up until a passenger asked her if she had bought a ticket for the umbrella, but she still didn&#39;t pick up the umbrella. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s a very small thing. I believe that most people will pick up the umbrella immediately when they are reminded that they should not put the umbrella on the seat. A simple action can avoid a heated dispute. Why wouldn&#39;t the umbrella owner refuse? There were no other passengers when she got on the bus. The umbrella was placed on the seat and it was not in the way. She thought it was reasonable to put the umbrella up. This was her first explanation. This is also the first reaction of some people when faced with their own mistakes. They do not correct the mistakes immediately, but look for rationalizations for the mistakes from their own perspective, standpoint and safeguarding their own interests. The more sufficient the reason is, the more self-justifying it is, the more it feels that it should be understood, and the more it feels that it is not wrong, so naturally there is no question of correcting the error. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second explanation given by the umbrella owner is that the seat has been wet and cannot be sat on. Fait accompli cannot be changed. Although it seems reasonable on the surface, it actually implies arrogance. This arrogance is related to environmental shaping. From childhood to adulthood, it is common for children to admit mistakes to their parents, students to their teachers, employees to their leaders, and subordinates to their superiors, but not vice versa. The subconscious mind that the strong and the powerful are justified is deep-rooted. From the umbrella owner&#39;s subsequent words, we can see her superiority and arrogance, that is, it is normal for my umbrella to be placed on the seat, and none of you have the right to criticize me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It takes courage to admit mistakes and correct them, and it takes even more courage to find mistakes and point them out. The historical allusion of Wei Zheng&#39;s blunt remonstrance has been passed down to this day, and we also know that &quot;it is enough to have one admonishing friend in life.&quot; However, in real life, people like flowers and applause far more than good medicine and criticism. Those who correct errors are often lonely, because their coming forward not only makes the wrongdoers feel resentful because they have no way to hide their mistakes, but also reflects the cowardice and cowardice of bystanders and beneficiaries, making them feel ashamed. The old man’s criticism is an example. If the old man heard what he said, would he come forward to correct his mistakes next time? If there are fewer people correcting mistakes, there will be more people making mistakes, so that even though they are making mistakes, they don’t know they are wrong, and they don’t know the difference between right and wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone has flaws and no one is perfect. It’s okay to make mistakes; mistakes are part of growing up. Whether a child or a parent, a student or a teacher, an employee or a leader, a subordinate or a superior, if you make a mistake, just face it bravely and make corrections sincerely. Give firm support to those who correct mistakes and sincere encouragement to those who correct mistakes, so that mistakes can generate the power to nourish virtue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为西南地区事业单位人员）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（南方周末App“hi，南周”栏目期待您的来稿。投稿邮箱：nfzmreaders@163.com）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2349名缅北电信网络诈骗犯罪嫌疑人一次性移交我方]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258688]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 15:37:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The public security organs have always been keeping a close eye on telecom network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar and have continued to carry out multiple rounds of On the basis of crackdown operations to resolutely eradicate fraud dens and arrest fraudsters in accordance with the law, the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau of Yunnan recently carried out border police law enforcement cooperation with relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar, and captured 2,349 Chinese telecommunications network fraud suspects and handed them over to us. square.

I don’t think there’s anything that shouldn’t be said. On the contrary, one-armedness is a very unique thing about me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You dare to face it only if you dare to speak, right? I don’t care about this at all now. In fact, there is no need to talk about whether I care or not. If you are still thinking about whether you care or not, it means you still care.

I actually don’t have particularly big ambitions, I just don’t like falling to the bottom. The so-called bottom does not mean material life. I am very adaptable to life.现在我也还是经常一天只吃两顿饭，不是没有钱，是没有时间，在船上有很多活儿要做，手上的工作中断了很麻烦，我宁可不吃饭也要干完。不喜欢底层是不喜欢那种没有目标、不能自己掌控自己的生活的感觉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从确立了参加2024旺代环球这个目标之后，生活就变成了一场战役。 2022年朗姆路单人跨大西洋、2023年咖啡路双人跨大西洋都是为了获得旺代环球的资格，我们没有那么多财力慢慢来，只能把一个赛季当成3个赛季，把一个人当成10个人用，我们赛队就5个人，德国赛队50个人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为这个是我自己的目标，我喜欢这个目标，所以我也没有觉得生活多苦，自己的牺牲有多大。一般人过我的生活会很难适应，会苦死，但我觉得这是我梦寐以求的生活。在一个非常美丽的码头，在一条非常棒的赛船上，做自己最愿意干的事情，做自己专业的事情，不用受任何人的支配、指挥和控制，我就觉得这已经非常好了，对吧？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/ps9YjERLoV0uQbWm6Z3XYKpkeQoZib9Sx4Oymdk1.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;航海跟我的天性甚至是相悖的，我特别稳妥、谨慎。我喜欢一个房间门窗关得严严实实的，没有任何小偷能悄悄进来这种。但是航海偏偏是四面漏风的，无论你在岸上做多么万全的准备，海上总是有状况出现，你就要拿着“盾牌”四面抵挡，很狼狈，我其实不喜欢那种意外。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也没有那么浪漫。有一种人是真的喜欢海上航行的孤独，比如法国传奇航海家伯纳德，对城市对人群他感到厌恶，疯狂热爱自由和航行，享受孤独。我不是那种人，我没有那么疯狂。我是一个“假疯子”，我也不是文艺范儿的那种。在海上，我总是会很想岸上的家人和朋友们，想靠岸后跟他们喝啤酒吃烧烤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论是以前作为国家帆船队的专业运动员，还是现在自己从事极限航海竞赛，我也不是那种非要拿冠军、崇尚金牌和胜者为王的竞技心态。有一些极限航海竞赛的人他们参加比赛就是为了赢，竞技策略很激进，如果不能赢，可能宁可选择退赛。我也不是这种。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/yST5LtCmWEI4dPPdC6KCdhDzm7YrmfK5wjv3OAfV.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，我非常理性。但似乎干着一件好像很不理性的很疯狂的事。环中国海、环球航行，驾驶6.5米的小船跨越大西洋，现在又买赛船参加世界上最难的极限环球航行竞赛。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;只能说明这个事情你真是特别喜欢。作为一个理性的人，你能对航海付出这么多，对你来说，这样真是已经疯狂到极致了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，是这样的。现在过的生活完全是一种疯狂状态。 2015年单人小船跨大西洋后，其实在国内就已经算是很顶级的了，当时在深圳一个游艇俱乐部做副总，收入和待遇都非常棒。放着好日子不过，2017年到2020年，跟阿九一起完成了为期三年的环球航行。结束后我们在海南也过得挺不错的，我又有了参加旺代环球的目标。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;青岛航海人才很多，在你前面已经有好几位传奇人物，为什么你能越走越远，特别是从2022年开始自己的世界顶级职业赛船船长之路？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我是一个“笨人”！一方面我很理性，还有一方面我不会想太多有的没的，当我觉得一个事儿很好，值得去做，我就不会想做了这个没做那个如何如何，不做这个去做那个怎样怎样……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我买了IMOCA60赛船后，开始回过味来了，因为理性开始分析了：咱一个普通农民家庭出身的人，每年不赚这些钱，还花这么多钱……就这种。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那个船光从岸上吊到水里，下水就要15000欧元，所以没有什么试乘试驾。钱付了，我第一次上船，真的感觉不真实，跟我以前开过的所有船都不是一个概念。那个船在海面上飞的时候，让我见识到为什么它被称为世界最顶级的赛船，“我终于站到了这条船上，这条船属于我们了！”心里这种感受刚升起来，下一秒就感觉到好大的压力，这条超级赛船好多的缆绳配件，真的很难在短时间内去学会，而且一个操作失误就会造成巨大的损失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我一看太复杂了，心想这根本搞不定啊，接手后就没有离开那条船，就在码头上停着，天天研究，两个月后才自己独自出海。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我不是很聪明的人，而且我很健忘，怎么也想不清楚当初买船的时候咋想咋算的。算了咱不想了，明天再说，明天又忘了这些事了，你又不想了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我喜欢机械的东西，对船可能有一点天赋吧。我们那个赛船特别复杂，欧洲很多船长都是有工程师学位的，同时还配有团队和教练，我就一个人去买的船。我初中都没有毕业，英语也是自学的，但是我不怵，花点儿时间我都能弄明白。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大部分时间我和赛船一起的感受都是愉快的，只是它太贵了，维修保养的账单都很昂贵。每次付账单的时候我很心疼，但我的理性就告诉我，赶紧付了得了，然后又忘了这个不开心了哈哈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/x2HEJrLwLBk7baJ6HnQgmSBo8lwDGmiNb3L1ZLHG.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我和大海之间是什么感情连接，我真得想一想。很长一段时间，我其实已经没有时间思考了，这种状态让我特别不舒服。海上航行是我的工作，我自己是喜欢这个项目的，但是这个事情现在确实让我很累，想到要回法国，我心里会有点抗拒，那边就像一个战场一样。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想要找到一个理性的原因，我不想轻易地说出来我为什么喜欢和为什么不喜欢。我需要想一想，我想找到一个真正的让我自己觉得能接受的答案。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;的确是。在天海之间行船是非常美好的享受，去过那么多海面连接的地方，看到的体验到的，都会让人觉得美好。但我其实可能还更喜欢极限航行比赛这种具体的目标感，让我一直漂在海上，我也会不满足。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我是一个完美主义者，还有点英雄主义。我不是说要做一个人拯救地球的那种超级英雄，我想做自己的小小英雄。在极限航行中顶住压力，跨越大海，每次完成回来，我会觉得我是一个小小的英雄。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于我来讲，从赛季开赛前的艰苦准备、开赛后的承受高压，到最后到岸时的那种释放，是我最享受的一个过程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/PRfAyTagmNJJWaGCsrssaVZ8gjAGh0PyPOXZ40sm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;航海拓展了我的身体能力和意志，我的身体特别好，都是在极限要求中发展出来的。我能感觉到自己身体的强大适应性和康复能力，身体的极限在极限环境中被激发出来了。这也是我特别喜欢航海的原因，我能感觉自己是人类中的强者，对我来说，这令我内心更加强大。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;航海不是浪漫向往或者一味勇猛就行的，要完成极限挑战，还要把赛船平安地带回来，要上岸给等待的家人一个拥抱。出发前需要做很多具体艰苦的工作让赛船有一个完美的状态，任何问题都要考虑到，有两套甚至更多预备应急方案。航海让我养成了超强的执行力，“说到做到”，目标有多高，自己就付出更多的努力，这个也刻在我骨子里了。凡事认真，绝对不会说说就算了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经历过独自航行的孤独和风浪后，我更加喜欢日常生活，发自内心地爱自己的环境和朋友。就像现在这样平静安稳、没有风暴的日常，都让人珍惜，让人想要赞美美好的天气和美好的氛围。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你有过非常孤单艰难的日子，青少年时代常有一种走投无路要掉到底层的恐惧和无望。 2012年独自启航开始环中国海的时候，抱着大不了一死的念头，心里很多愤懑。这么多年航行，你跟自己和命运都和解了吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;2012年那时候真的是带着一种跟命运赌气的感觉，心里有种壮士一去不复还的那种悲壮，甚至也带着一些怨念，说为什么我这个人一辈子要这么难，你们不相信我就拼死一搏，我要让这个事情去发生，对，带着这种劲。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在这些都被医治了，完成一个一个目标对我来讲很重要，你慢慢知道自己是可以掌握自己的命运的。小时候在农村，我又少了半条胳膊，周围真的是一个没有目标、生活漫无目的的环境。你不知道你的目标在哪，你也从来没有达成过一个目标，你会厌恶那个懦弱又不堪一击的自己，渴望充满斗志和勇气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过航海，我有了一个又一个目标，这也是自我医治和成长的过程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从我用7个多月修好了一条要报废的小船，把它命名为“梦想号”，并且实现了环中国海这第一个目标后，我学会了相信自己、相信梦想。其实如果那一次失败，可能我这一辈子也不会再起来了，可能就彻底被打垮了，不光是被外界的东西打垮了，自己那道防线也没了。现在回头看，真的也觉得当时别人说我不切实际是可以理解的，自己可以说太幸运了，那个开始让我学会了相信，这种信念帮助我一步步走到现在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;离岸远航，深入海心，在离两边大陆都有1500海里的那种场景，你会有什么感受？大海对水手来说，是善意的还是恶意的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我其实没有什么特别文艺的感受。对于我这条赛船来说，在大洋中心的时候反倒不害怕，它的安全性能特别好，设计出来就是为了对抗风暴的，只要你自己不操作错误，非常安全。反倒是靠近沿岸，渔网啊往来船只等各种东西都会对这条船构成威胁。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大海它没有善意，也没有恶意，它无意伤害你，它就按照自然法则客观存在着。在海上人自然会平静下来，不会那么愤世嫉俗。我说实话，我觉得我更怕人。有时候专心忙航海的事情不看新闻，心很定，一关注社会新闻，感觉自己无所适从。西方社会制定的规则是针对东方的，东方又要针对西方做些制衡，对吧？好多事情都没有一个客观裁定的规则，混成一团，超级复杂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/sHh7XjhhF6fTr6VquWLzIvx8bI30sFUYjc6vvFgX.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;其实我现在已经在开始做调整了，因为我知道确实这个东西压力太大了，真的会把人压断的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;调整的前提还是船的状况一定要极致，在岸上把船照顾好，到深海里，船才能把我照顾好，这一点是肯定的。咖啡路开赛在即，各个赛队非常紧张忙碌，而我却能回国休整，就是因为前面没日没夜做了很多工作，船已经处于最佳状态了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生活上也做一些调整。有一段时间我们都住在船上，方便工作，老外看我们也是很吃惊，早晨、晚上这俩中国人都在干活。前段时间刚租了一个房子，生活稍微正常一点。有一段时间，压力真的大到我看到那条船都已经厌恶了，失去乐趣了，我心里知道这肯定不行的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对接下来旺代环球那种魔鬼航程，你如果没有真诚的热爱，没有真诚的信念，你的初心如果丢失的话，你是不可能坚持下来的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;旺代环球被称为“海上珠峰”，是地球上最难的极限航海赛事，你现在的目标还在顺利拿到旺代环球的入场券上，等到你最终顺利跑完旺代，回到并没有那么具体明确目标的日常生活，到那时候，已经完成了最难赛事目标的你有信心可以投入到寻常生活中吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;确实我有这个问题。每次完成一个赛事目标，停下来以后，我确实有时候不知道怎么应对生活里边的事。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的天赋是我能够去管理好一个单一的事情，我把这条船打造到极致，做得非常好，全力以赴，不偷懒不耍滑，这是我的一个性格。但一回到生活当中，需要应对一些规则，有时候我就觉得不公平，就会让我很不舒服，我不喜欢被压抑，但有时候你又无力反抗，包括对于人事会觉得很头疼，对人事我非常不敏感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如你看我那么多好朋友和大哥，其实每次回来我经常会忽略了给他们带点东西或者是多一些关心回馈什么的。在这方面我是一个弱智，经常到了人家门口了才想起来今天什么也没有带，你又不是说不懂这种人情世故，你也一把年纪了你又懂，但是反应过来的时候总是晚了，生活中就总是不那么灵光。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;咖啡路你和英国传奇船长迈克·戈丁搭档，1200海里的资格航程，比去年朗姆路资格赛快了17个小时。迈克有过三次旺代参赛经验，十夺咖啡路亚军，你驾驭赛船也越来越娴熟，除了参赛完赛是否对名次还有更高预想？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;从我自己还有赛船的能力上，的确是可以冲击更快的速度的，我的船到现在还只释放了百分之七十的性能，没有往极限去狠跑。但是我们的策略还是安全完赛，拿到积分。说实话，我手上连大修一次的钱都没有，没有任性跑的资本。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一点我跟迈克·戈丁船长也有过明确沟通，他非常理解，他也经历过这种资金有限的困难时期。策略非常明确，但执行到位不犯错仍然会是一个挑战，我天天告诫自己千万别激进，别贪快！一定要慢，一定要慎重！但是在海上很多时候都是瞬间决断，那一瞬间很难说自己认为正确的决定是真正明智的。希望我和搭档能够配合好，在具体情况中能够做好平衡。 &lt;/p>;
