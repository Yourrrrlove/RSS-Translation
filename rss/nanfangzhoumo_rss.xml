A month ago, Ukraine used a Scalp cruise missile to destroy a Russian Black Sea Fleet submarine that was being repaired in a Crimean shipyard. This is the only submarine sunk by a cruise missile so far. In addition, the Scalp missile also accurately hit the headquarters building of the Black Sea Fleet, and its performance in actual combat was quite outstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this is not the only naval equipment that India has recently purchased from France. On October 28, 2023, the Indian Navy just submitted a purchase request for 26 Rafale carrier-based aircraft to the French government. It can be seen that India is preparing to The carrier-based aircraft will be completely replaced with French Rafales instead of upgrading the Russian-made MiG fighters that have been used for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The procurement plan is by no means simple. It is part of India&#39;s ambitious naval reorganization plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Indian Navy Vice Admiral Ajendra Bahadur Singh told the media: “Some naval ships will be decommissioned in the next few years, and at the same time By adding some more ships, we hope that the number of naval ships will reach more than 200 within 15 years (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;to 2037&lt;/span>;).&quot;&lt;/span>; p>; &lt;p>;Since India’s independence in 1948, the Indian Navy has always hoped to become a blue water navy with 142 ships and operating two aircraft carriers at the same time. However, so far, the Indian Navy has only about 132 ships and 200 ships. The ship&#39;s target seemed a bit difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difficulty of India&#39;s naval expansion is far from a matter of quantity being far from 200 ships. It is that India not only needs to add 68 ships within 15 years, but also needs to acquire most of the navy&#39;s main battle equipment within these 15 years. NATOization. This also means that India must eliminate at least one-third of its active main warships, that is, more than 40 ships, in order to achieve the initial goal of NATOization. In this case, India must equip more than 100 ships within 15 years, and India currently equips about 4 new ships every year. At this rate, the Indian Navy may only maintain its current scale, not to mention India&#39;s huge equipment expansion The plan also includes building a new aircraft carrier, which is undoubtedly more difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a realistic perspective, India&#39;s naval reorganization plan may not be as ambitious as it claims. The Indian Navy has long relied on Russia to supply equipment, and Russia suffered huge losses in the war. Most of the supporting supply chains for large surface ships in the Soviet era were in Ukraine. Since the Crimean crisis in 2014, Russia has been unable to obtain supporting products from Ukraine. As a result, its large surface ships have difficulty even in overhaul and maintenance, and may no longer be able to continue to supply India in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When India and Russia previously cooperated on the &quot;Chaori King&quot; aircraft carrier renovation project, the progress was delayed and the cost was seriously overrun. At that time, India realized that relying on Russia was unsustainable, so it had begun to build large surface ships on its own. Industry Planning. Unfortunately, India was sanctioned by the United States because of nuclear weapons issues, and could only make do with continuing military cooperation with Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As relations with the United States have heated up rapidly in recent years, India&#39;s plan to manufacture its own naval equipment is accelerating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first indigenous aircraft carrier &quot;Vikrant&quot; manufactured by India&#39;s Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) will be officially commissioned in 2022, marking that India has the ability to build its own aircraft carrier - although this The construction of the difficult-to-deliver aircraft carrier has been delayed from the start of construction to the official commissioning. The Indian Navy has been waiting for this for 17 years. However, compared with aircraft carriers, the construction process of India&#39;s domestic destroyers can be said to be quite smooth. It only took ten years from the project establishment in 2011 to the commissioning of the first ship in 2021, and it is being launched at a rate of one per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, India has built three 7,000-ton Visakhapatnam-class destroyers on its own. The ships have a stealth appearance and an Aegis air defense system. India claims that its localization rate has reached 75%. It is a model of Indian warships made in China. It can be seen that the Indian shipbuilding industry has no big problems with technology and construction capabilities, at least in building large battleships of the destroyer level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another thing that is good for the Indian shipbuilding industry is the signing of an agreement between India and the United States in 2021, announcing that India will become the future large-scale equipment maintenance center of the U.S. Navy in the Indo-Pacific region. The 2022 US-India 2+2 ministerial dialogue announced that the United States intends to inspect Indian shipyards. Immediately afterwards, the USS Charles Drew (T-AKE-10) docked at Kattupalli Shipyard for maintenance and repairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This agreement means that the United States will help India improve its maintenance and construction capabilities of large warships, and even directly provide technical cooperation, allowing India to master the construction and maintenance technology of large U.S. warships, as well as related technical standards and management. process. Judging from the experience of Japan and South Korea, the cooperative weapons and equipment maintenance bases established by the United States after the Korean War played a key role in improving the technology of the local shipbuilding industry and optimizing management processes. In particular, a country like South Korea, which became independent after World War II, has a weak industrial base and a lack of talent. The technical support provided by the United States is crucial to the establishment of its industrial system. Thanks to this, South Korea has also established its own military industry, and even Now it has begun to become a new type of weapons and equipment exporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although India&#39;s independent manufacturing capabilities for main battle equipment have long been poor, it has to admit that it has at least independent manufacturing capabilities for naval equipment. The remaining problem is how to connect with American standards and become a Part of the U.S. global military equipment logistics maintenance system. Considering that India&#39;s economic development momentum is booming, and the technical restrictions on it by the United States and Europe have been almost completely lifted, it is possible to replace the original Soviet-Russian system and Westernize its naval equipment in 15 years, at least while maintaining the existing Given the scale, it is a completely achievable goal to replace the old and adopt the new. As for whether it can be expanded to a scale of 200 ships, it depends on the execution capabilities of the Indian shipbuilding industry and economic development. However, it is foreseeable that with the help of Western technology, the combat effectiveness of Indian naval ships will definitely be greatly improved. This is also the goal that the United States and India hope to achieve in military cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[北极光：极夜中的极致绚烂]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261722]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我匆匆地走入森林中丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261724]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/NQsVYC8CantGXtnTIuGm3J0qDiNMceoDGzXZeGIW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;691&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/NQsVYC8CantGXtnTIuGm3J0qDiNMceoDGzX ZeGIW. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259217&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Lu Junjie/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For related reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/260804 &quot; title=&quot;The dispute between the 94-year-old man and his nanny for 2 million pension funds&quot;>;The dispute between the 94-year-old man and his nanny for 2 million pension funds&lt;/a>;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer, a dazzling news: 94 Lu Delin, a 20-year-old Shanghainese man, told on social media that he was abused by his nanny and defrauded of his pension. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai is the super-large city with the highest aging population in the country. According to Shanghai&#39;s 2022 elderly population and aging undertaking monitoring statistics, the registered elderly population aged 60 and above in Shanghai in 2022 will be 5.5366 million, accounting for nearly 40% of the total registered population. Among them, the number of elderly people living alone is 300,600. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The connection between individual circumstances and the lifeline of the times is about to emerge. It is a topic of public value. After encountering countless stories, I still can’t help but feel the initial excitement and impulse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, standing in winter and thinking back to that summer, the first thing that comes to mind is the part about mosquitoes. The scene we first arrived at was the community where the incident occurred. The community is located in Huangpu District, Shanghai, in the city center. It was built in the early 1990s and has 4 high-rise buildings interspersed with lush tall trees and low grass. It was a summer evening in Shanghai, and there were two or three old people sitting on the benches downstairs enjoying the shade. I wanted to know some surrounding information, and I became the target of &quot;mosquitoes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The culprit is probably the &quot;flower mosquito&quot; as the local elderly call it. In just three or two hours, it left more than a dozen red and swollen bumps on my legs that were already wearing trousers. It was obviously not appropriate to scratch and chat at the same time, so I had to scratch twice quickly in the gap from one bench to another. The physical feeling was real, and this unspeakable and unseemly detail became the first fragment that hit me in my memory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This feeling is like a coincidence, and it has been fulfilled in several recent questions, which are about the body. In the topic of Lu Delin, the accused nanny is no longer in the local area. Even during the exchange of evidence before the court session, she still did not appear. The subjects on the other side, the two elderly people, were taken to Hangzhou by their son and daughter-in-law, and their mental condition was not very good for a time. Well, considering that I was afraid that the visit of strangers would bring excitement to the two old people, I did not go to see them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the message left for me? It&#39;s an empty house, and there are surrounding clues that need to be found. Room number 2401, pushing open the closed door, the first thing that came out was a sour smell. This is supposed to be well-ventilated, with a square shape, looking into the other side of the living room, with a wide balcony and large windows. There are several orchids on the balcony. The flower pots are quite old, and the branches and leaves are wilting. For a moment, people don&#39;t know whether they should be described as being well-groomed or not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moldy cutting boards, dirty yellow clothes, expired food, all indicating the disorder of life, suddenly broke into my eyes in an instant. In the eyes of young people, in the undisordered time, what I discussed with my friends around me was more about the spiritual part, and the instinct of the body was automatically ignored in the surface respectability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last topic was in Xi&#39;an. The interview subjects were some disabled people. In the continuous rain, we could not wait for the scene of their &quot;reunion&quot; and had to go door to door to chat. During the process, everyone The disorder of the body was mentioned invariably; and after Lu Delin chose the topic, I continued my business trip in Shanghai. The new topic was about Alzheimer&#39;s disease. The wife who became a caregiver told the story of taking care of her sick husband for nine years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From these stories, we can see what everyone is trying their best to maintain, and this effort seems to be an inevitable disorder of life. As a bystander, I hurriedly walked into this forest and felt the &quot;disorder&quot; that I had never experienced in real life. Some disorders are accidental, such as a car accident or sudden illness. They are also unprepared and rush into the forest and never get out; some disorders are slow, such as aging. They are already on the road to aging. It has been too long, so long that I have to admit that aging has come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Returning to the perspective of journalism, when we encounter these stories, how should we report this disorder? After the initial excitement and impulse, it’s time to write. I think that we should not visit this forest with a pair of curious eyes and notice something unsightly. It should not be regarded as the author&#39;s delicate observation and be presented freely. It’s better to enter this forest with a level gaze. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this time we entered this forest because of work, such a forest may break into our real life at any time, and in addition to the accident that breaks in at any time, its final arrival is a kind of inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“巴基斯坦可以从中国学到很多”:专访巴参议院国防委员会主席]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261738]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73936&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70727&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/4eecfa1ded.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Exclusive interview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;At noon on December 1, Mshahi De accepted a face-to-face interview with Southern Weekend reporter.

(Photo/Southern Weekend reporter Wang Hang)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of December 1, Guangzhou Yuexiu International Conference Center. After the one-hour press conference, Pakistani guest Mushahid Hussain Saeed walked out of the venue quickly. Entering December, the weather in Guangzhou turns cooler. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I like Guangzhou. It has a pleasant climate and is a very dynamic place in China.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mushahid is the chairman of the Defense Committee of the Senate of Pakistan and the chairman of the Pakistan-China Society. From December 1st to 3rd, he was invited to participate in the 2023 &quot;Understanding China&quot; international conference to discuss and communicate with domestic and foreign guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past fifty years, Mushahid came to China many times. In his words, he witnessed the poverty-stricken China in the 1970s and the reform and opening-up China in the 1980s. &quot;What we see today is a prosperous and powerful China that is leading the development of globalization.&quot; Mushahid said, &quot;I am very happy to witness the rise of China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Mushahid Shahid spent four years in Washington, the United States, and obtained a master&#39;s degree in international relations from Georgetown University&#39;s School of Foreign Service, &quot;with an understanding of the U.S. political system and how it operates.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He proposed that there are two different &quot;roads&quot; in the world today. One proposed by the United States and Western countries is security-centered, military-led, and focused on conflicts and confrontations. On the contrary, China insists on connectivity and cooperation, respecting diversity and being more inclusive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past 10 years, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, an important pilot project of the “Belt and Road Initiative”, has brought development opportunities to Pakistan. &quot;26 billion U.S. dollars of investment, 250,000 job opportunities, and 28,000 Pakistanis came to China to study. Electricity, roads, hospitals, education, etc. are constantly improving.&quot; Mushahid said, &quot;These have benefited Pakistan.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Global and regional security are also the focus of the conference. Regarding peace on the India-Pakistan border, Mushahid has optimistic expectations. &quot;Border conflicts can be resolved as long as there is will. We reject global hegemony and we reject regional hegemony.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on December 1, Mushahid accepted a face-to-face interview with Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“If you want to learn from China, it is crucial to understand China”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/h4>; strong>;&lt;span>;Is this your first time to participate in the &quot;Understanding China&quot; forum? How do you feel? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mushahid: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is my first time to participate in the &quot;Understanding China&quot; forum. This forum is very valuable. First of all, we use this platform to understand China, the region and the world, and how they change and develop. Secondly, it is important for Pakistan to understand China. Because China is our closest strategic partner and our neighbor. Third, personally, I have been dealing with China for nearly fifty years. When I first came to China, I was still a young man of 17 or 18 years old. As a friend of China and a student of Chairman Mao, I saw China at that time. It can be said that I have witnessed China&#39;s transformation. If you want to learn from China, it is crucial to understand China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Compared with the first time you came to China, now what is the difference? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mushahid:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first time I came to China was in the 1970s. At that time, China was very poor and isolated from the world. Today, China has become rich and powerful, a global leader, and a leader in globalization. China has proposed the “One Belt, One Road” initiative to lead green development and technological innovation. So, this is a huge change. In addition to China, the world has also changed. Because the global center of gravity is shifting from the West to the East. This change in China also reflects global changes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What are your impressions of Guangdong? For example, for the two big cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mushahid:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first time I came to Guangdong Province was in 1972, when Guangzhou A trade fair is being held. During that time, I went shopping at Guangzhou Friendship Store. I only had 200 yuan with me at that time, but I felt like a &quot;millionaire&quot;. Because no matter how I bought it, I never spent all the money. At that time, the price of Chinese goods was too cheap. There were no computers at that time, so people used calculators to calculate accounts or calculate money by hand. Then, I took a train from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, which was indeed a wonderful experience. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I went to Shenzhen was in 1982, and then in 1984. At that time, Shenzhen was a remote fishing village. After seeing it in person, I also felt that it was too backward and underdeveloped. When I first came to China, the city of Shenzhen did not exist. But in the subsequent 1980s, I saw the rapid rise of Shenzhen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Many Pakistani businessmen do business in Guangzhou. Can they find business opportunities here? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mushahid: Of course. Pakistani businessmen in Guangzhou have been working here for years, even decades. In fact, many trades began not just now, but decades or even centuries ago. Guangzhou has always been a hub of connectivity and a warm and welcoming city. Foreigners are welcome to come here to do business and stay here. It has a pleasant climate, is close to the sea, and is a beautiful city. So Pakistanis enjoy life here, we support them and they can make a lot of money. So I think it&#39;s very good and they play a very good role in promoting relations between the people of Pakistan and China. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Pakistan can learn a lot from China”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span >;Over the past 40 years, China has undergone tremendous changes. What lessons do you think this has for Pakistan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mushahid:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think Pakistan can learn a lot from this. First, have a clear vision. Second, there must be the will to turn this vision into reality. Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China&#39;s reform and opening up, once said, &quot;Seek truth from facts&quot; and &quot;development is the last word.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insist on development and openness, simplify bureaucracy and cumbersome processes, give talents the attention they deserve, and put them first. Good leadership qualities, policy continuity, learning from mistakes, openness and inclusiveness, focus on people-centered development, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I said, we can learn a lot from Guangdong, China, and China&#39;s reform and opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Are you confident about Pakistan’s future development? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mushahid:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am very optimistic about the future of Pakistan. I studied in the United States for four years, but I didn’t want to live there. I said I would go back and serve my country. This is thanks to our relationship with China, which is our neighbor and our best friend. China invests extensively in Pakistan. We must unleash the energy and creativity of the people of Pakistan, move forward, reduce bureaucracy and allow them to develop. We need to build industries, innovate, get education, and let them focus on what they should do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73937&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70728&quot; src= &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/c3787969cf.png&quot; img-title=&quot;Interview.png&quot; alt=&quot;At the media meeting on December 1 , Mushahid said that the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative is a historic opportunity for Pakistan.

In the past ten years, China has invested US$26 billion in Pakistan, created 250,000 jobs and produced 8,000 megawatts of electricity. These results have given Pakistan and its people confidence in the future. For example, Gwadar Port has developed and become a hub between Pakistan and Central Asian countries. So this is a big opportunity. Because of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, a whole new world is unfolding. This is a historical opportunity for Pakistan to develop rapidly, and it is also a historical opportunity to learn from China&#39;s poverty alleviation and green development model. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people have misunderstandings about the &quot;Belt and Road&quot;, but most Pakistanis fully support the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; and the Maritime Silk Road. Many Pakistanis care about China. They believe that China is Pakistan&#39;s good friend and close ally. Therefore, the negative voices come from foreign propaganda. They come from misinformation, false stories and fake news. We have to fight back against this. This is the biggest challenge facing the Belt and Road Initiative in the next decade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Terrorist attacks occur frequently in Pakistan. How should the government solve the problem of terrorism? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mushahid:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Unfortunately, terrorist incidents do happen from time to time. Some of the terrorists come from neighboring areas, which are very unstable. Some are forces that do not want cooperation and development between Pakistan and China. In addition, we feel that there are foreign forces controlling terrorist activities in Pakistan, and they specifically target Chinese companies, individuals and projects. Therefore, we must develop an effective counter-terrorism strategy in Pakistan, carry out effective Pakistan-China security cooperation, and develop effective plans to protect Chinese projects and Chinese people living in Pakistan. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“We reject global hegemony and regional hegemony”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2023, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister will visit India for the first time in 12 years. Do you think India and Pakistan have the will and motivation to deal with border conflicts? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mushahid: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Border conflicts can be resolved as long as there is a will. India should be broader-minded and not become narrow-minded in dealing with small countries. We reject global hegemony and we reject regional hegemony. Whether it is Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, etc., they all reject hegemony. Look at Afghanistan, they reject American hegemony even though they are a small country. Therefore, the size of a country does not equal its strength. India should learn from the mistakes of other major powers and understand how they went in the wrong (direction). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The internal and external obstacles to solving the India-Pakistan issue are What? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mushahid:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the internal obstacles mainly come from the negative attitude of the Indian government, and their mentality must change. The external problem is the &quot;new cold war&quot; launched by the United States against China in Asia. They are using India to counter China. This is where the problem lies. Therefore, India should be part of the Asian countries and should be part of the Belt and Road Initiative. We want India to be united with us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India is a nation-state with a great civilization. Why say no to this? Why should India work and behave like Washington or London? India should cooperate with Beijing, Kathmandu, Dhaka and Colombo. This is a regional issue. The future belongs to this region, not Europe or the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: rgb(154, 0, 0);&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If India continues to respond negatively to relations between the two countries, will there be a risk of escalation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mushahid:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think escalation can be avoided because India also knows that if they try to escalate, the other country will respond . Every country hopes to safeguard its territorial integrity, safeguard sovereignty, and maintain unity and dignity. They tried to launch an attack on Pakistan in February 2019, and they sent several aircraft over Pakistan. But we fought back and shot down two helicopters. So the country will respond, and this response will come quickly and strongly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[金融合规榜：万余条罚单中，哪家银保机构在坚守底线？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261734]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 18:24:02&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;For the financial industry with strict supervision and strong supervision, compliance Rules are the bottom line that must be adhered to. As the world&#39;s largest banking market and the second largest insurance market, China&#39;s banking and insurance industries have always been the focus of supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Today, financial institutions’ compliance will be elevated to a new level. The Central Financial Work Conference pointed out that &quot;financial chaos and corruption problems continue to occur, and financial supervision and governance capabilities are weak&quot; and emphasized that &quot;financial supervision must be comprehensively strengthened to effectively prevent and resolve financial risks.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Compliance has thus become a core consideration for the soundness of financial institutions’ operations. Which financial institution often commits crimes? Which financial institution frequently charges sky-high fines? Which financial institution has the most business lines involved? This is not only the key regulatory orientation of regulatory agencies, but also a concern of every financial consumer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In order to monitor the compliance of various financial institutions in real time, the relevant departments of Southern Weekend worked together for nearly a year to build the &quot;Shepherd-China Financial Industry Compliance Cloud&quot; Platform” (hereinafter referred to as the “Sheepdog Platform”). After continuous iterative upgrades and improvements, the &quot;Sheepdog Platform&quot; now collects in real time the administrative penalty information publicly released by the People&#39;s Bank of China, the State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and their national offices, and simultaneously performs manual correction. test. In order to ensure the accuracy of the &quot;Sheepdog Platform&quot; data, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center compared the recorded data with the information released by the three institutions one by one. The comparison results show that the accuracy of the penalty information data collected by the Shepherd Platform is as high as 100%, with no omissions or errors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In order to objectively present the compliance of 20 systemically important banks and nine major life insurance companies in 2023, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center focused on the &quot;Sheepdog Platform&quot; &quot;More than 10,000 pieces of data collected were mined and analyzed to construct the 2023 China New Financial Compliance List. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Penalty information from three regulatory agencies, two dimensions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Based on the &quot;Sheepdog Platform&quot; in real time Includes administrative penalty information publicly released by the People&#39;s Bank of China, the State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and their national offices. Therefore, this data information basically covers all regulatory penalties for the banking and insurance industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also conducts statistical analysis on the number of fines and the amount of fines received by financial institutions, because the number of fines and the amount of fines respectively reflect the extent of violations. How many and whether the violation is serious or not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;According to statistics, from January to October 2023, 20 Chinese systemically important banks and their branches received a total of 802 fines, with an average of 802 fines per bank. and its branches received 40 fines; the above-mentioned fines totaled nearly 1.127 billion yuan in fines, and each bank and its branches were fined nearly 56.3548 million yuan on average. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Nine major life insurance companies and their branches received 287 fines, with an average of 31 fines per life insurance company and its branches; the total of the above fines The fine was nearly 52 million yuan, and each life insurance company and its branches were fined nearly 5.73 million yuan on average. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;From a mean perspective, banks have higher values ​​than life insurance companies in terms of both the number of fines and the amount of fines. Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believes that this is related to the bank&#39;s large scale and business volume. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center collected 10,467 pieces of penalty information (including institutions) issued by the three major regulatory agencies from January to October 2023 on the Shepherd Platform Penalty information and personal penalty information) conduct data mining analysis and construct a new financial compliance list for 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Which bank was fined the largest amount? Which company has been punished the most? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The bank compliance list shows that China Construction Bank, Minsheng Bank and Shanghai Bank took the top three spots. Among them, China Construction Bank and China Minsheng Bank were fined more than 200 million yuan each, far exceeding the 98.544 million yuan imposed by Bank of Shanghai. The list of the number of penalties imposed on the bank compliance list shows that the five major state-owned banks of Industry, Agriculture, Postal Service, Construction, and China are among the top five in the list, and the number of institutional penalty information is more than 70, far exceeding the sixth place Minsheng Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;New Financial Competitiveness Ranking - Bank Compliance Ranking (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/4bfa379375.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2389&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/12/02/4bfa379375.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260500&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: justify;&quot;>;Banks in the new financial competitiveness list Compliance list (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Observed by bank type, from January to October 2023, the number of institutional fines received by each bank is basically the same. They are arranged in order of state-owned banks, joint-stock banks and city commercial banks. There is no obvious pattern in the amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;For state-owned banks, during the time period included in this list, compared with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Postal Service Bank, Bank of Communications The degree of compliance is relatively good. In terms of the amount of fines, Bank of Communications ranked twelfth, while the other five state-owned banks were all ranked in the top ten. At the same time, the number of fines received by Bank of Communications is also relatively small, and it is the only bank that is not in the echelon of state-owned banks in terms of the number of fines. The bank received 41 pieces of penalty information during the time period of this statistics. The number of penalty messages is only higher than that of China Minsheng Bank, a joint-stock bank in the echelon, with 42 messages. China Construction Bank became the bank with the largest amount of fines at this stage due to a fine of nearly 200 million yuan issued by the former China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (now the State Administration of Financial Supervision) on February 16, 2023. In addition, the amount of each fine of ICBC, which ranked first in the number of fines, did not exceed 6 million yuan. Therefore, its total amount of fines ranks low among state-owned banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The compliance status of joint-stock banks and city commercial banks is relatively similar. During the statistical time period of this list, one bank in each of the above two categories ranked in the top three in the list of fines imposed, and the reason was that they received large fines of more than 60 million yuan. Bank of Nanjing and Bank of Jiangsu are the two banks with the best compliance during the statistical period of this list. The fines imposed on the above two banks did not exceed 10 million yuan, which were 600,000 yuan and 8.601 million yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believes that because the four major banks have large business scale and many branches, a high number of penalties does not necessarily mean that their compliance is lower than that of other banks. bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Loans are still the hardest hit area for violations&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Analyzing the types of violations, the statistical time of this list During this period, the violations of the 20 systemically important banks were concentrated in three areas: loans, external guarantees and customer identification. Among them, the loan business is the hardest hit area for bank violations. The above-mentioned fine of nearly 200 million yuan from China Construction Bank involves a total of 38 violations of laws and regulations, 15 of which are related to violations of loan business. Among the top ten in terms of the amount of fines received, except for Shanghai Bank, which only had one fine for &quot;violating the handling of domestic guarantees and overseas loans&quot; and seven other fines involving illegal handling of foreign exchange business, the fines received by the remaining nine banks all related to loans. Business violations. In fact, according to penalty information over the years, loan business violations have always been an &quot;old disease&quot; in the banking industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Illegal handling of domestic guarantees for overseas loans and illegal external guarantees are the largest fines imposed on banks by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange during this statistical period. Bank of Shanghai and China CITIC Bank were fined 98.544 million yuan and 11.7544 million yuan respectively for the above-mentioned issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In addition, customer identification issues were the third highest fine imposed on banks by regulatory agencies during this statistical period. Among them, the highest fines received by Ping An Bank and Postal Savings Bank during this statistical period both involved &quot;failure to perform customer identification obligations as required&quot;, and the fines for these two tickets were 53.4117 million yuan and 31.86 million yuan respectively. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Based on the above analysis, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center suggested that banks need to focus on the compliance of loan business, guarantee business and payment and settlement business. How to eradicate old diseases and ensure the compliance of loan business is an issue that major commercial banks need to think about urgently. Today, some banks have applied artificial intelligence technology to assist manual loan review and other processes. Therefore, improving the accuracy of artificial intelligence technology in assisting in reviewing loan information may be one of the feasible solutions to rectify the &quot;old disease&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Life insurance companies urgently need to strengthen the implementation of internal control systems&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The life insurance compliance list shows that regardless of Ping An Life ranks first in terms of both the amount of fines and the number of fines it has received. Taikang Life ranked third and second respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The second place in the list of the amount of fines and the third place in the list of the number of fines are Taiping Life and China Life respectively. It is worth noting that AIA Life Insurance Co., Ltd. performed better in this compliance list. During this statistical period, AIA Life was the only financial institution among all participants in the list that did not receive any fines from the three major financial regulatory agencies and their dispatched agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;New Financial Competitiveness List - Life Insurance Compliance List (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/717a9f37af.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1313&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/12/02/717a9f37af.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260501&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: justify;&quot;>;Life insurance in the new financial competitiveness list Compliance list (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;From the perspective of the types of violations, life insurance companies’ violations are mainly fraud, deception and inducement of policyholders and system management issues . According to the &quot;Sheepdog Platform&quot;, from January to October 2023, there were 453 pieces of information about penalties for life insurance companies. Among them, 187 involve fraud, 105 involve deceiving or inducing policyholders, and 130 involve internal control systems and management issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In fact, most of the fines involving &quot;inadequate implementation of internal control systems&quot; involve &quot;preparing false information&quot; and &quot;inciting and inducing insurance agents to engage in acts that violate integrity&quot; voluntary activities”. &quot;Instigating and inducing insurance agents to engage in activities that violate their fiduciary obligations&quot; is the root cause of &quot;deceiving or inducing policyholders&quot;. This may be related to the business value concept of the company and its branches. If the design of the company&#39;s assessment indicators is unreasonable or the implementation is deformed, or the managers of relevant departments behave inappropriately, it will be difficult for their subordinates, especially grassroots personnel, to ensure business compliance when conducting business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Therefore, the compliance issues of life insurance companies this year can basically be attributed to the unscientific design of the indicator system and the inability to implement the internal control system. The Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center recommends that leaders of life insurance companies should adhere to the strategic focus of high-quality development and should not ignore compliance for temporary performance impulses, let alone engage in fraud that affects the image of the company or even the life insurance industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 18:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[寿险效能提升榜：谁现在领先？谁拥有未来？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261736]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 18:31:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In 2023, China’s life insurance industry will continue to undergo difficult transformation. In a complex and ever-changing market: Life insurance was a hot seller in the first half of the year due to high interest rates, but the twists and turns in the equity market made life insurance investments suffer. &quot;Integrating newspaper and bank into one&quot; (see Southern Weekend App for details) Perennially deformed? &quot;>;&quot;Big accounts are high and small accounts are constantly rising. Why is the bancassurance business deformed all year round?&quot;&lt;/a>;) The new regulations have made the bancassurance channel under pressure even more uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, life insurance companies are still determined to continue transformation, pursuing efficiency improvements, and are more committed to the blue ocean market of pension insurance and insurance +, and are competing for more considerate customer service upgrades . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Who is leading the race to transformation? Who sticks more to the &quot;customer-centric&quot; strategy? Which company is more transparent and open to the media and the public? Which company pays more attention to compliance? Which company pays more attention to innovation? Based on the principles of objectivity, fairness and science, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center constructed an evaluation index system for life insurance performance improvement rankings and evaluated the performance of each life insurance company. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Eight major dimensions&amp;nbsp;Fourteen sub-indicators&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;Life Insurance Performance Improvement List&quot; Quantitative The qualitative evaluation index system consists of six first-level indicators and fourteen second-level indicators. Among them, the first-level indicators include three quantitative dimensional indicators of &quot;operational capabilities, customer service, and regulatory compliance&quot; and three qualitative dimensional indicators of &quot;business cross-penetration, comprehensive health ecology, and product innovation.&quot; The secondary indicators are refined into fourteen sub-indicators. The total weight of the quantitative and qualitative indicators is 70%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At the same time, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center team assigned media factor weights based on the special research on the above-mentioned life insurance companies, and invited an external expert jury to evaluate the participating life insurance companies. The company conducts independent real-name scoring. Both scores have a weight of 15%. Among them, the media factor mainly refers to the openness and transparency of the life insurance company under investigation to media research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/48d509878a. png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2087&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/48d509878a.png&quot; data-key= &quot;260503&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: justify;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Now The specific description of quantitative and qualitative indicators is as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;(1) Business capability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;How to judge the management ability of a life insurance company? From the perspective of business model, the business logic of life insurance companies is to collect premiums to form insurance liabilities, use insurance liabilities to invest to form investment assets, and the investment assets generate investment income. Therefore, to evaluate the operating capabilities of a life insurance company, one is to look at its ability to obtain premiums; the other is to look at its investment asset management capabilities. Original premium income is commonly used in the industry to measure the liability capacity of life insurance companies, but the premium income of nine life insurance companies accounts for about 3/4 of the life insurance industry. The life insurance performance list aims to select the best among the best, so the new indicator insurance service income is included in the statistics&lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;What is insurance service income? According to the explanation in China Ping An’s semi-annual report, insurance service income refers to recognition during the insurance period based on the provision of services, and excludes investment components. Insurance service income reflects the income obtained from engaging in insurance business. In accordance with the provisions of the &quot;Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 25 - Insurance Contracts&quot; (Finance [2020] No. 20) revised and issued on December 24, 2020, listed insurance companies will implement it from January 1, 2023. This regulation is also called the &quot;Chinese version of IFRS 17&quot;. Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found in its survey that, except for China Life and Taikang Life, seven other life insurance companies have applied the new insurance contract standard IFRS17. Under the new accounting standards, insurance business income is replaced by insurance service income, which also leads to a significant reduction in the recognition of premium income of life insurance companies. Life insurance companies with a large proportion of investment savings products and a high proportion of single premiums will be more obviously affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In addition, new business value and embedded value measure the insurance company&#39;s value, profitability and sustainable development, and the total investment return rate measures investment performance. These three indicators are commonly used indicators in the industry. In summary, the total weight of the four secondary indicators in this dimension is 20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;(2) Customer service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The insurance industry is a typical service-intensive industry. How to implement the &quot;customer-centered&quot; development concept, meet the diverse needs of customers, and improve the service quality of the insurance industry are key issues for my country&#39;s insurance industry to achieve high-quality development. From the demand side, the age composition and demand of insurance customer groups have changed significantly, and young customers have increasingly higher requirements for insurance services. From the supply side, my country&#39;s insurance products are highly homogeneous, with little difference in product pricing and basically similar scopes of liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believes that the life insurance industry cannot sell insurance as a &quot;fast-moving consumer goods&quot;. Otherwise, large-scale surrenders may occur, and the service attributes of &quot;slow experience&quot; and &quot;slow decision-making&quot; of insurance should be returned. Risk protection is the core function of the insurance industry. To implement &quot;customer-centric&quot;, on the one hand, insurance must be renamed insurance and return to the protection function; on the other hand, insurance must be made &quot;value for money&quot; insurance. In other words, we need to make it affordable, worthwhile, convenient and reassuring for consumers. Based on this, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has set up three secondary indicators to measure claims settlement amount, average claim settlement timeliness and surrender rate in the customer service dimension. The total weight of the three indicators in this dimension is 15%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;(3) Compliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;During the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; period, &quot;standardization&quot; has become the key word for the development of the insurance industry. At present, institutional supervision, behavioral supervision, functional supervision, penetrating supervision and continuous supervision have gradually formed. In 2021, the focus of supervision will be on the top-level design of the reform. In the fields of corporate governance, solvency, and insurance capital utilization, the &quot;Corporate Governance Guidelines for Banking and Insurance Institutions&quot;, &quot;Insurance Company Solvency Supervision Rules (II)&quot; and &quot;On Modifying the Parts in the Areas of Insurance Capital Utilization&quot; were released Notice of Normative Documents&quot;. In 2022, regulatory agencies will deepen supervision of consumer rights and interests and issue the &quot;Management Measures for the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests of Banking and Insurance Institutions.&quot; This is a basic and programmatic document in the field of consumer rights protection in the banking and insurance industries. In 2023, supervision will shift to the regulation of bancassurance and individual insurance channels, and the &quot;Notice on Regulating Insurance Products in Bank Agency Channels&quot; and &quot;Measures for the Management of Insurance Sales Behavior&quot; will be issued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center sets four sub-indicators in the compliance dimension, among which core solvency adequacy ratio and comprehensive solvency adequacy ratio are key regulatory indicators; insurance The service quality index refers to the 2022 insurance service quality index released by China Banking and Insurance Information Technology Management Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;China Banking and Insurance&quot;); the data on the number of administrative penalties comes from &quot;Sheepdog&quot; - China Financial Industry Compliance Cloud Platform Regulatory data collected by the system from January to September. The total weight of the four sub-indicators of this dimension is 20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;(4) Business cross-penetration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;This dimension reflects the synergy and cross-selling capabilities of life insurance companies between different business lines. The Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believes that the growth logic of life insurance institutions has shifted from &quot;scale&quot; to &quot;quality.&quot; The “insurance + service” development strategy has become an industry consensus. The weight of this dimension indicator is 5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;(5) Healthy ecological construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The development of pension finance is inseparable from the construction of a comprehensive health ecosystem, because &quot;the elderly are provided for and the sick are treated&quot; are inseparable. Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center evaluates the development of life insurance companies in the field of big health business based on the annual reports or other public information of each life insurance company. The weight of this dimension indicator is 5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;(6) Product innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;This dimension mainly reflects the product development and innovation capabilities of life insurance companies. The weight of this dimension indicator is 5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;China Life leads the way&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Based on the above dimensions and indicator system, and integrating the 2023 results of various life insurance companies Mid-year reports and announcements, as well as data from third-party rating agencies, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center evaluated 9 insurance companies and obtained a total score of quantitative and qualitative indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Based on media factor weights and external expert review weights, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center constructed a life insurance performance list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The results of the list show that China Life, Ping An Life and AIA Life ranked the top three. Among them, China Life and Ping An Life have a clear lead and are the only two life insurance companies on the list with a total score of more than 60 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12 /02/1da3a7600f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1188&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/1da3a7600f.png &quot; data-key=&quot;260504&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: justify;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify ;&quot;>;Sub-indicator system observation shows that in the quantitative and qualitative indicator scores, China Life, Ping An Life and AIA Life ranked in the top three, and there was a wide gap between the scores of the other six life insurance institutions. There is a nearly ten-point difference in scores between AIA Life in third place and Taiping Life Insurance in fourth place. This shows that the first-tier life insurance companies have a larger lead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In the scores of the expert jury, the expert judges favored Ping An Life Insurance. The company was the only life insurance company to receive a score of 9. In the media factor, AIA Life, PICC Life and China Pacific Insurance failed to respond within the limited time for some reason and did not score, which in turn affected the overall score to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Observed from different dimensions, China Life, Ping An Life and PICC Life ranked the top three. China Life&#39;s 2023 interim report did not apply the new insurance contract standards, but replaced insurance service income with insurance business income, so there is an overestimation to a certain extent. However, China Life’s third quarter report for 2023 shows that its insurance service revenue reached 136.439 billion yuan, only slightly lower than Ping An Life’s 168.945 billion yuan. Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center calculated and found that the adjustment did not affect China Life&#39;s ranking in the life insurance performance list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Why does China Life top the list? China Life has obvious advantages on the liability side. China Life&#39;s third quarterly report shows that in the first three quarters of 2023, the scale and growth rate of premium income, new policy premiums, and first-year regular premiums all hit new highs for the same period in the past three years. First-year regular premiums with ten years or more were RMB 44.639 billion, a year-on-year increase of 15.4%, accounting for 42.12% of first-year regular premiums; new business value continued to grow in the first three quarters of 2023, with a year-on-year increase of 14.0%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;From an asset perspective, declining investment returns are a common problem in the industry. Against the backdrop of downward shifts in interest rates and fluctuations in the equity market, investment returns in the insurance industry have generally declined. Data from China Chengxin International shows that in 2022, the life insurance industry&#39;s investment return rate will drop to 3.8%, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points from 2021, which is significantly lower than the industry&#39;s average investment return rate of 5.3% in the past ten years. Therefore, the overall score for this indicator is low, with PICC Life scoring the highest because it uses group data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;China Life performs well in the customer service dimension. In terms of sub-indicators, China Life’s three indicators are all at the leading level in the industry. Data from the company&#39;s 2023 interim report show that the average claim settlement timeframe is 0.39 days, a year-on-year increase of 17%; &quot;claims prepayment&quot; exceeded 74 million yuan; &quot;claims direct payment&quot; exceeded 3.41 million; &quot;one-day critical illness compensation&quot; compensation amount exceeded 5.4 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At the same time, China Life does not fall behind in terms of regulatory compliance. In terms of sub-indicators, the company&#39;s core solvency adequacy ratio reached 140%, and its comprehensive solvency adequacy ratio reached 204%, both well above regulatory requirements and at the average level among the nine life insurance companies. In the 2022 Insurance Service Quality Index released by China Banking and Information Technology, China Life received a high score of 94.61, which is higher than the average level of 85.28 in the personal insurance industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, according to data from &quot;Sheepdog&quot;, a compliance cloud platform for China&#39;s financial industry, China Life was fined 47 times (including branches) in the first three quarters, a high On average 29 times. Because China Life has a large business volume and many branches, this indicator does not mean that the company&#39;s compliance is lower than that of other peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Develop pension finance and cultivate new growth poles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In the midst of high-quality transformation of life insurance companies Nowadays, as the core component of the third pension pillar, pension insurance is becoming a strategic insurance type. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believes that pension finance has huge potential. The three-dimensional indicators of business cross-penetration, comprehensive health ecological construction and product innovation reflect the development of pension finance of life insurance companies to a certain extent. However, the disclosure standards of various life insurance companies are not uniform because they are in the exploratory period. Therefore, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center conducts evaluations based on the annual reports of each life insurance company and with reference to various information such as announcements and publicity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The results of the list show that although Ping An Life ranks second in the total score of the list, it scores first in the three qualitative indicators. China Life Second, AIA Life, Taiping Life and Sunshine Life tied for third. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center also found in its survey that nine life insurance companies are actively participating in the construction of pension finance. Among them, China People&#39;s Pension Insurance Co., Ltd., China Life Pension Insurance Co., Ltd., and Taiping Pension Insurance Co., Ltd. are the first batch of pension insurance companies designated by the State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau to participate in the commercial pension pilot. The pilot is about to be completed for one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Other life insurance companies are also actively exploring pension finance business. For example, Ping An Life relies on the resources of Ping An Group of China to continue to make efforts in the direction of &quot;insurance + services&quot;. In terms of &quot;insurance + health&quot;, Ping An Life launched the &quot;Ping An Zhenxiang RUN&quot; health service plan. In the first three quarters of 2023, Ping An Life has served more than 19 million customers, a year-on-year increase of more than 10%; in the &quot;insurance + high-quality health care community&quot; In terms of &quot;Ping An Life Insurance&quot;, Ping An Life has teamed up with other professional companies within the group to build a high-quality health care brand &quot;Zhen Yi Nian&quot;. In October 2023, Ping An Zhenyi Nian officially released Wellness Care 3.0, launching two new benefits: residence and CCaH (Continuing Care at Home). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In terms of &quot;insurance + home care&quot;, Ping An Life continues to explore home care services. As of the end of September 2023, Ping An&#39;s home care services have covered 54 cities across the country, with a total of more than 70,000 people qualified for home care services, and more than 50% of policyholders in 54 cities have activated their home service rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Taikang Life has formed a collaboration with 20 &quot;Taikang Homes&quot; across the country and has become an industry benchmark. Sunshine Life will start with the Sunshine Family (Guangzhou) health care community and gradually deploy a chain of CCRC senior care communities across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believes that the integration of medical and nursing care is a general trend, and &quot;insurance + services&quot; is becoming a new blue ocean. All life insurance companies should continue to innovate in products and services. On the one hand, they should enrich product connotations and expand the coverage of insurance products; on the other hand, they should extend the value chain of insurance services and provide comprehensive services such as health management, medical services, and long-term care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 18:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[欠发达县1个在编身后1.8个临聘：转移支付保“吃饭财政”难以为继]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261728]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to &quot;Half Moon Talk&quot;, the reporter was in a county in Wumeng Mountain District During the investigation, it was found that the county’s total wage guarantee budget expenditure for the year was 2.63 billion, including 2 billion for in-service personnel, 170 million for retired personnel, and 460 million for temporary personnel. The number of temporary employees is 1.8 times that of in-service employees, but the total salary budget of the former is less than a quarter of the latter. In addition, the county&#39;s total salary expenditures for temporary employees have exceeded the county&#39;s total tax revenue. In several neighboring districts and counties of the county, the average number of temporary employees is 1.7 times that of in-service employees. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Specifically, the per capita annual income of temporary employees in the county is about 16,100 yuan, and the total number of employees is 28,806; the per capita annual income of current employees is about 12.83 million, and the total number of personnel is 15,580. The per capita annual income of current employees is eight times that of temporary employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How do you view this phenomenon? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First of all, the county has been completely reduced to &quot;food finance&quot;. The total annual salary budget for temporary staff is 460 million, which has exceeded the county&#39;s total tax revenue, which means that the county&#39;s economic strength and endogenous fiscal capacity are very weak. Against the background that the sluggish housing market has stalled land finance, especially in small localities, the total annual budget expenditure of 2.63 billion on guaranteed wages will most likely come from transfer payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for the economically developed areas that currently provide sources of transfer payments, their finances are not sufficient or even very difficult. It is impossible to maintain the &quot;food finance&quot; for a long time by relying on transfer payments. , the county may have to slim down: reductions in personnel, staff, budgets, and expenditures are inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Secondly, the so-called on-the-job personnel are formal workers with a formal establishment; the so-called temporary personnel are temporary workers and contract workers without a permanent establishment. If we have to reduce headcount, which category of people will be eliminated first? From the perspective of effectiveness and efficiency, how should redundant staff be eliminated? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The answer to the first question is obvious. In the case of financial difficulties, unemployed personnel will be laid off first. This is also a common practice everywhere. It’s called “clearing out temporary workers.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason is very simple: the principle of minimum action. In theory, there is no iron rice bowl anymore. The current &quot;Civil Service Assessment Regulations (Trial)&quot; has annual assessments, and the results are divided into four grades: excellent, competent, basically competent and incompetent. &quot;The annual assessment for two consecutive years is determined to be Those who are found to be incompetent will be dismissed.&quot; But in fact, unless a major principled error is made, it is very difficult to lay off an employee with a civil servant or a public institution, and few leaders are willing to be evil and &quot;smash people&#39;s jobs&quot; and are worried about being sacked. The job holder or his family may cause trouble, be unsightly, and have a &quot;bad influence.&quot; But it&#39;s different for temporary workers without official establishment. They are mentally prepared to be laid off due to the company running out of money or the superior&#39;s request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, should temporary workers be eliminated (first)? Before answering this question, you must understand why the company recruits temporary workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Temporary workers are different from temporary workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​is that there is a relationship, but the relationship is not strong enough and it is not enough to get the establishment in one step. First, recruit people to make a temporary transition and wait for the internal opportunity to become a regular employee. Banyuetan reporter&#39;s investigation found that the recruitment and management of most temporary personnel are not handled by a unified department and are basically carried out according to the principle of &quot;who employs people, who recruits them&quot; without approval or approval from the establishment department, finance department, organization department, human resources and social security department. The registration and recruitment procedures are relatively haphazard, with the phenomenon of disorderly growth in quantity and unguaranteed quality, and it is difficult to eliminate recruitment based on personal relationships and relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The other type is irrelevant or almost irrelevant. They are recruited to do the dirty and tiring work that regular workers are unwilling to do. , hard work and troublesome work, you may be pushed out to take the blame if something goes wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also many internal contradictions in such units: on the one hand, formal workers get more money, good benefits, but work less, and there are various ways to obtain honors and Opportunities for promotion; on the other hand, temporary workers who work receive less money, poor benefits, and more work. If something goes wrong, they will be pushed out to take the blame. With such a close contrast, the latter&#39;s psychology will be very unbalanced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, if we look at the logic of the market, temporary workers are paid market prices; for the same position, regular workers are paid more than temporary workers. Part of it is the premium brought by the preparation. When multiple people compete for an organization, they compete for the premium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Public people think that when &quot;retiring temporary workers&quot;, the first type of eviction is to let those who do not work leave to improve efficiency, but in fact The second type is often eliminated, which is to let the temporary workers leave. It doesn&#39;t matter and they are hard-working, so there is the least resistance to the elimination. However, after they are dismissed, the regular workers often complain because someone has to do the work. After laying off these many people, work can still be done. In this sense, efficiency has been improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Finally, government functions should be viewed from the perspectives of government and market/society. Government management should also live within its means: a county&#39;s tax revenue is less than 500 million a year, and the total budgeted expenditure on guaranteed wages is 2.63 billion. The county has been financially exhausted. Do we really need so many people, spend so much money, and take care of so many things? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;We should sort out: which management and service functions are absolutely necessary and can only be performed by the government, and what budget and staff size are appropriate; which ones can be abolished to allow Society manages itself; what is considered excessive regulation or improper regulation stifles economic vitality? Even if a county has too many net outflows of people and its population and economic scale continue to shrink, then merging counties is also a good choice, and merging villages It has been practiced in many places such as , , towns and villages, reducing the scale of government and releasing market vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, it is because civil servants have become the de facto iron rice bowl and the premium brought by the establishment is very high, that’s why everyone has such a big interest in the public examination preparation. enthusiasm. If we can implement the annual assessment of civil servants and public institutions, and dare to fire veterans who only get paid but do not work like market-oriented enterprises, and reduce the premium brought by the establishment to zero, everyone will be more rational about the public examination preparation. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is another way to compress or even eliminate the premium brought by staffing: marketize job salaries and see how much the temporary workers recruited from the market are paid. Then the salary of regular workers is as close as possible to that of temporary workers, so as to squeeze out the premium of establishment. Cleaners in a certain place have a staff. Cleaners with staff hire people to do their work and then enjoy the price difference. This difference is the premium brought by the staff. The government or taxpayers were taken advantage of and spent more money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 18:25:19 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家卫健委：目前流行的急性呼吸道疾病均由已知病原体引起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261726]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 15:16:28&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The National Health Commission held a press conference today to introduce the prevention and control of respiratory diseases in winter.

In September 2023, &quot;Xiucai&quot;, an Internet celebrity with tens of millions of fans who specifically targets middle-aged and elderly people, was reported for tax evasion and defrauding fans, and his account was banned.

Dong Xueru discovered that her grandma regarded the other party as her crush in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My grandma is from Sichuan and lives in Beijing with few friends. For more than ten years, a man has regularly organized square dances for two to three hundred people near her residence. This teacher Tie often wears floral clothes with English letters printed on them, dyes her blond hair, and wears a little makeup. She becomes the idol of middle-aged and elderly people and calls them &quot;sister&quot;. Later, my grandma moved and could no longer dance in the square. Instead, she took online dance classes and could only watch videos in the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Grandma firmly believed that these messages were sent by Teacher Tie, because only Teacher Tie, who was eight years younger than her, would treat her like a sibling. &quot;These (public accounts) different names are all the pseudonyms of Teacher Tie, and they are all his online names... All these articles are written for her.&quot; Dong Xueru told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Grandma sends a lot of messages every day. &quot;I feel like I have so much to say. As long as I sit down, I will hide in the room with my mobile phone and send voice messages.&quot; Once, my younger brother sent a message saying that he came to his sister&#39;s city and saw a figure that looked like his sister. He was very disappointed to find that it was not the same. Grandma comforted, &quot;Fool, why are you disappointed? I&#39;m thinking of you too.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Xueru and his family tried to persuade him many times but to no avail, and his grandmother felt bored. They took grandma to the local public security bureau to receive Internet security education, but grandma wouldn&#39;t listen and just asked the police if they could find people online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Xueru’s mother and uncle had no choice but to ask Teacher Tie himself for clarification. Teacher Tie denied that it was him and made it clear that he had no time for a relationship and would not like her. The family played the recording to grandma, but she decided that the children were hindering her and pushing Teacher Tie too hard. &quot;He is immature and childish.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After speaking out online, Dong Xueru’s post received nearly 4,000 replies. Many netizens said that their family members have encountered similar situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A girl sent a private message to Dong Xueru, saying that her grandmother was also obsessed with such public accounts and corporate WeChat. In addition to giving rewards, she would also buy high-priced goods sold by them. When the mother found out, she deleted the accounts in anger. Soon, the grandmother added them back, accusing her daughter of blocking her pursuit of happiness. The relationship between mother and daughter is still at a stalemate. The girl said to Dong Xueru, I really don’t know what to do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A large number of younger brother accounts use subscription accounts, corporate and personal WeChat and Moments to conduct false emotional exchanges with the elderly, thereby inducing rewards.

(Screenshot by Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The fake younger brother is back&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After Dong Xueru’s post attracted attention, the platform successively banned some younger brother accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kai got angry when talking about these Dongdi and Ruidi numbers. Ma Kai runs a number of emotional public accounts and has been implicated recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kai’s public account is similar to an emotional radio station. The largest account has 34 million followers. It posts a six- to seven-minute emotional chicken soup every day, “What should you do if you feel tired, etc.” Emotional words.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kai emphasized to Southern Weekend reporters that his account is different from the scam account. Accounts like Dongdi and Ruidi &quot;won&#39;t tell you any emotional quotes or send you any songs, they will just kill pigs&quot;; while my own &quot;di&quot; account relies on emotional copywriting to seek rewards. There will be no false identities, false stories, or emotional deception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has been paying attention to these younger brother public accounts for a long time. They all speak in the same way and can be roughly divided into two categories: one is for younger brothers to participate in concerts and needs support from popularity; the other is for younger brothers who are sick and hospitalized and need support. Medical expenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Diverting traffic from video accounts to public accounts is the beginning of harvesting. Operators leave links to public accounts in the comment area of ​​video accounts, place payment codes in articles on public accounts, or leave corporate WeChat or private accounts. WeChat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the registered entities of these public accounts are enterprises. Southern Weekend reporters found that a large number of similar accounts were registered by several department stores in Haikou, with names such as &quot;Xiu Cai Singing Department Store&quot; and &quot;Rui Rui&#39;s Department Store&quot;. According to industrial and commercial information, many department stores have different operators, but use the same mobile phone number when registering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter contacted one of the operators Y. There are four Hainan department stores under Y&#39;s name, which are specially used to register younger brother&#39;s public accounts. WeChat stipulates that an individual business owner can register two public accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Y told Southern Weekend reporters that his team of three people has registered a total of 12 individual businesses. He has been working in this industry for nearly a year, and the largest public account has 70,000 to 80,000 followers, all of whom are Drain and accumulate traffic through video accounts. He refused to disclose his income, saying only that he &quot;doesn&#39;t make much.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the e-commerce platform, for only 100 yuan, some merchants provide individual business license agency services, upload ID card information and mobile phone number, and perform remote real-name authentication. The store said that there is no limit to the number of registrations per person, and there is no need to pay money to continue after applying, and there is no need to worry about inspections by the industrial and commercial authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using false individual business registrations to increase the number of WeChat public accounts is no longer a secret in the industry. These public accounts have become a powerful tool for batch release of information and batch operations. Y proved this. He is in Guangzhou, but his registered store is in Hainan. Ma Kai added that compared with the complicated materials that ordinary companies need to submit, individual industrial and commercial households only need to spend tens of yuan a year to prepare an annual report, and the above-mentioned merchants also provide agency services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A small program called &quot;Praise&quot; provides praise services for younger brother accounts. Unlike WeChat&#39;s direct rewards, third-party programs reward through jump links, which can avoid the risk of having your account frozen after being reported by users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the comment area of ​​this mini program, there are still a lot of messages from sisters, &quot;Hello, dear baby brother! Good afternoon! Sister gives you some love for the author. How is your brother? I miss you so much. You, my sister has had trouble at home these days, so she hasn’t sent many messages to my brother. I hope my brother will understand and forgive my sister. My sister really likes you and loves you. She loves you and will never leave you and will always be with you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On November 14, &quot;Praise&quot; issued an announcement stating that the platform had no way of knowing whether users who received praise were committing fraud, and revealed that from October 9 to November 4, 2023, A user who was complained received a total of more than 250,000 yuan in praise. &lt;/span>;The amount of money defrauded can be staggering. In the early days, these accounts used WeChat to reward, and the number of rewards was publicly visible. Ma Kai observed that a Ruidongdi subscription account team from Fujian received at least 400 rewards a day at its peak, and it was estimated that the daily income could be as high as two or three dollars. Ten thousand yuan; another subscription account from Hebei has about 7,000 to 8,000 reads per day. The official account has not many fans. Before being blocked, it had accumulated more than 3,000 likes. According to his understanding, this type of account first started in Fujian and spread to Guangdong, Jiangxi, Chongqing and other places, and lasted for about a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After these public accounts were banned by WeChat, they had to start looking for new methods. Their corporate WeChat account is still functioning. The original link to the official account was changed to a link to the &quot;Tencent Content Creation Platform&quot;. The payment code can still be placed on the content interface. Moreover, if users have previously added their business WeChat accounts, they will still receive push messages every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Ma Kai has been reporting on these corporate WeChat accounts, but with poor results. He dug up the historical records and said, “What you see is just the chatting and tipping on the surface. It is conceivable whether there are chats and transfers behind the scenes, right?” He believes that Enterprise WeChat is the real concentration of traffic. “Enterprises WeChat is originally a marketing tool and can add more people.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Y told Southern Weekend reporters that two-thirds of the accounts on the market are no longer there. He no longer has a similar account and plans to prepare live broadcasts to bring goods out of town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/GLkoxSPeP2ndaFoKiXmqdVIyfZ8gE8uzlQcsfO82.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;2078&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/GLkoxSPeP2ndaFoKiXmqdVIyfZ8gE8uzlQcsfO82.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260438&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 1, the public account &quot;Dongyinxianban&quot; published a new article, continuing the false younger brother persona and telling stories in the video to induce rewards. As of 10 o&#39;clock that night, 38 people had tipped. The author of this article has posted similar content many times before, but has deleted it and canceled his account. Now it appears in a new public account. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;She needs love, she is truly not alone&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Xiao Lin runs an emotional public account for young people. Recently, she often receives some strange messages in the background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to changes in the push mechanism of WeChat public accounts, the platform will recommend content that may be of interest to non-followers. As a result, her public account was accidentally seen by some middle-aged and elderly people and became a favorite of some people. Emotional tree hole. Most of their messages are scattered and unclear, and they seem to express their feelings to someone:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Do you know? I have forgiven you a long time ago, and I am waiting for your sincerity to pick me up, you know?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You have been away from me for more than three years. It is normal to get married, start a family and start a business, but you are still in my heart.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A woman from the Northeast has been sending voice messages almost every day since September. At first it was a long string of scoldings, but later her tone became gentle. She seems to have fallen in love with a man and regarded his official account as his. Sometimes, she speaks quickly and in a crying tone, always starting with &quot;Dear baby&quot; and repeating: Why don&#39;t you come back? Why don&#39;t you reply to my message? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Lin did not dare to reply, for fear of breaking her confession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Xueru only realized the delicate side of her heart from her grandma&#39;s love. My grandma lost her first husband more than 20 years ago and experienced two failed relationships. She followed her children to Beijing and barely attended school. She became literate through the Internet and likes to watch video accounts and public accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Xueru grew up with his grandma. When his grandma first fell in love, she couldn’t type. She read a sentence and Dong Xueru typed: &quot;Dear husband, I miss you so much. I love you. When will you come back to see me?&quot; .&quot; Sometimes, my grandma didn&#39;t know how to express it in words, so Dong Xueru helped her write some templates - &quot;Dear, eat more and take care of your health&quot; and &quot;Dear, go to bed early&quot;, and grandma passed it on to the other party as needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No matter how old a man or a woman is, they will be lonely, especially if they are single. As a relative, the care you can give him is only part of it. She needs love to truly not be alone.&quot; Dong Xueru said that grandma was avoiding them more and more, and was still obsessed with the conversation with the teacher Tie in her mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Wenhan’s grandma is also addicted to short videos. In her description, her grandma was a simple and compassionate person who had been deceived many times in her eighty years of life and always believed those stories about poverty and misery. After my grandfather passed away five years ago, my grandma suddenly became free and her life revolved around her children. After moving to a big city, she lost contact with her friends and seldom socialized. Soon, she started to watch short videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She often sees her grandma falling asleep while watching short videos, and then continues after waking up, muttering to herself in conjunction with the AI ​​dubbing in the short videos. The short video said, &quot;Can I call you mom?&quot; and grandma murmured, &quot;Of course, kid.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Wenhan majored in gerontology when he was studying abroad. According to her observation, many elderly people abroad live in retirement communities and have their own social circles, but the elderly in China seem to need more emotion and sustenance. &quot;They need to be provided with some emotional value, that is, they are needed, or they still have charm.&quot; Wang Wenhan said. For a while, her grandma told her that she always dreamed that she was leaving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &quot;Research Report on Emotional Care for the Elderly and the Use Value of Short Videos&quot;, Peng Huamao, a professor at the Department of Psychology at Beijing Normal University, conducted a survey of 2,000 elderly people across the country. The research team found that the elderly who chase Internet celebrities on the Internet are still &quot;too lonely and lack attention&quot; in their offline lives. During the survey, Peng Huamao asked the elderly people interviewed whether they still need love. The vast majority of the answers are need, mostly the love of children, and of course the love of the opposite sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Huamao told Southern Weekend reporters that when the elderly and short videos are mentioned on the Internet, they are always about addiction, earthiness, etc., and most of them have negative impressions. An old man who travels thousands of miles to chase celebrities or give rewards in a live broadcast room will always be considered to be cheated. &quot;The advanced psychological needs of the elderly are always ignored, such as the need for love, respect, and self-realization.&quot; One of the results of the survey is that the vast majority of elderly people have the ability to control and understand that this compensation is not actually true satisfaction, but a diversion of attention or the passing of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Dong Xueru’s online post, a user left a message saying that her aunt encountered the same situation and fell into a brother-like public account and secretly rewarded her. After her wife discovered something was wrong with the money, she confiscated her mobile phone and called her relatives to persuade her. My aunt, who had been in charge of housework all her life, became almost crazy and cried loudly, not believing that this was a scam. The policeman called by her family was determined by her to be an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final solution was that the family registered a fake WeChat account for the younger brother and chatted with the aunt in a way that &quot;destroyed the personality&quot;. The younger brother ceased to be perfect and decent and became rude, shattering his aunt&#39;s fantasy. Finally, my aunt blocked this younger brother’s account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Dong Xueru, Ma Kai, Xiao Lin, Wang Wenhan are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子编排“老头强奸孙女致怀孕”被拘留：可比照“老夫少妻”造谣案入刑丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261716]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;Let me tell you a story. There was an old man who took care of a granddaughter and a granddaughter at home, and ruined both children. The older one was only twelve years old and was three months pregnant, and was finally discovered by the teacher.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 27, a video was circulated on the Douyin platform, attracting public attention. On November 29, Chongqing Hechuan Police issued a notice: This video is a rumor. Liu (female, 46 years old), a criminal, posted unverified rumors through Douyin in order to earn gold coins on the Douyin platform. Faced with doubts from netizens about the unverified rumors. To refute the rumors, it was clarified that as of the time the information was deleted, it had been commented and shared nearly 700 times by netizens, causing adverse effects. At present, the police have imposed administrative penalties on the woman involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the police report, the woman involved should have committed an act that constituted &quot;publicly insulting others or fabricating facts to slander others&quot; in paragraph 2 of Article 42 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. She accepted the &quot; shall be detained for not more than five days or fined not more than five hundred yuan.&quot; Judging from the behavior of the woman involved, her alleged illegal and criminal behavior may not be just &quot;fabricating facts to slander others&quot;, and there is still room for continued discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the timeline of this case, the video uploaded by the woman involved can be said to be completely unrelated to pictures and texts. It only excerpted the video picture of the victim old man and his granddaughter, and then started to show the video to the wall. The fiction &quot;played its best&quot; and weaved an &quot;incest tragedy&quot;. Its frivolous tone, bad nature, and clumsy techniques all made netizens look at it. When netizens questioned it, the woman involved did not delete it immediately, nor did she clarify or apologize. As a result, the video continued to spread. At the time of the incident, it had accumulated 700 comments and shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not yet clear what channel or method the woman involved used to obtain the information of the old man and his granddaughter, but this first violated the personality rights of the victim’s grandparents and was a blatant violation. Their right to image and reputation. The particularity of this case is that the woman in question misappropriated the victim’s information, in addition to seeking the benefits of the Douyin platform gold coins. From the perspective of the result, it was a brutal trampling on the personal reputation of the victim’s grandparents and grandchildren. The severity of the crime was far beyond a simple &quot;Making pornographic rumors&quot; or &quot;slandering&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Douyin platform can be regarded as a public place. If the woman in question makes such a specific and &quot;below the lower limit&quot; accusation in a public place, she has an obligation to ensure the authenticity of the accusation and at the same time defend her remarks. Responsible. Therefore, in addition to violating the Public Security Administration Punishment Law, the woman involved is also suspected of other illegal and criminal acts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Article 1 of the &quot;Interpretations of Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in the Handling of Criminal Cases Using Information Networks to Commit Defamation&quot; by the two top governments, &quot;tampering with the original information content involving others on the information network into facts that damage the reputation of others&quot; , disseminate on information networks, or organize or instigate people to disseminate on information networks&quot; shall be deemed as &quot;fabricating facts to slander others&quot; as stipulated in Article 246, paragraph 1, of the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The behavior of the woman involved in this case has obviously met this requirement, and the video comments she posted on Douyin have been shared 700 times, which is in line with Article 2 of the judicial interpretations of the two Supreme Courts that &quot;the number of reposts reaches More than 500 times&quot; standard for &quot;serious circumstances&quot;. According to Article 246 of the Criminal Law, the woman involved is guilty of defamation and the circumstances are serious, and she should be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance, or deprivation of political rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, compared with similar previous cases, the woman involved may deserve criminal punishment for her illegal and criminal behavior, rather than just administrative punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of &quot;a woman was rumored to be an old husband and a young wife&quot; in 2021, the man involved, Wu Moumou, took a photo of the woman with her grandfather&#39;s grandparents and rumored to be an &quot;old husband and a young wife&quot;, and also issued a sensational content of rumors. After the incident, the People&#39;s Procuratorate of the First District of Dongguan City prosecuted him for defamation. In September 2023, the court ruled that Wu Moumou fabricated facts to slander others on the information network. The circumstances were serious and seriously endangered social order. Based on the circumstances of the defendant&#39;s crime and his confession and punishment, the defendant Wu Moumou was sentenced to one year in prison for defamation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Moumou’s behavior constituted the crime of defamation. The court adopted the relevant definitions in the judicial interpretations of the two Supreme Courts and determined that Wu Moumou had tampered with “original information content involving others on the Internet to damage the reputation of others.” Facts, disseminated on information networks”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, even if &quot;old husband and young wife&quot; is true, it does not violate any law in the marriage and family section of the &quot;Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, and it does not even touch upon the so-called moral and ethical issues. This kind of news can at most arouse the curiosity and onlookers of netizens. In comparison, the rumor-mongering behavior of the woman involved in this case is even more outrageous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that if the accusation of the woman involved is true, then such a despicable &quot;grandfather-grandson incest&quot; has violated the criminal law and constitutes the crime of rape, and it meets the requirements of &quot;under the age of fourteen, a severe punishment&quot; &quot;The standard is also in line with the standard in the &quot;Opinions on Punishing the Crime of Sexual Assault on Minors According to the Law&quot; that &quot;persons who have a common family relationship with minors must be severely punished in accordance with the law.&quot; The &quot;old man&quot; involved may face severe punishments of more than ten years in prison, life imprisonment or death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the woman involved made such a serious public false accusation, she was suspected of false accusation and frame-up in addition to defamation. Article 243 of the Criminal Law also stipulates that fabricating facts to frame others with the intention of subjecting others to criminal prosecution constitutes the crime of false accusation and frame-up. If the circumstances are serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance; if serious consequences are caused, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, if the life of the victim’s grandfather and grandson is greatly affected and causes bad consequences, the woman involved should bear greater responsibility. Therefore, this case is not in compliance with the principle of proportionality. The woman involved is suspected of a criminal offense. The public authorities can continue to pursue her criminal responsibility, require her to apologize, eliminate the impact, and provide civil compensation. The three victims of the crime will also be given justice to their grandfather and grandson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
