There is a word &quot;bitter summer&quot; in Japanese that specifically describes the scorching summer heat. Even if you cannot fully understand its original meaning, the single Chinese word &quot;bitter&quot; can already convey the meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/WsZh4SZI60RS60TPLMVRINpXpRxZuFCDHCT7edrx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/WsZh4SZI60RS60TPLMVRINpXpRxZuFCDHCT7edrx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258160&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the Tokyo Imperial Palace running route, there are facilities designed to cool down runners. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time I came to Japan was in 2019. If the epidemic has changed anything, I hate it the most. Runners have started running, and running on the streets of Tokyo is itself a mark of the epidemic. At the height of the epidemic, all sports venues in Beijing were closed. I couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore, so I ordered my first pair of running shoes online and started running along the empty streets. From barely finishing 3 kilometers, to the joy of running 5 kilometers for the first time, to completing 10 kilometers and half marathon, although it may not be worth mentioning among the huge running community, it is a small achievement for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Running also gives me a new perspective on a place. Familiar places have new experiences because of running. In turn, this sense of strangeness also makes every small &quot;tribulation&quot; more enjoyable. Easier to get through. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/2ZPsf6DyySDGykcwiy80TWWk3Yxmn3x8xHSMee12.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/2ZPsf6DyySDGykcwiy80TWWk3Yxmn3x8xHSMee12.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258158&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Scenery of the Imperial Palace Running Route&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been to Tokyo a lot times, but I did some homework before coming this time and knew that the running route around the Imperial Palace is the most famous; the writer Haruki Murakami prefers to practice around the Meiji Shrine Outer Garden. He wrote in &quot;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&quot; &quot;Specially mentioned in the book; if you want to run at a higher pace, or complete interval running training Cross-intensity running exercises can help improve runners&#39; ability to resist lactic acid)&lt;/span>;, you can go to the Yoyogi Park track and field to try your skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While doing my homework, I also learned that Tokyo has complete supporting facilities for runners. Near the most popular route around the Imperial Palace, there are several hotels where runners can store bags, bathe, and change clothes. The service station only charges a fee equivalent to 30 to 40 yuan, and you can also rent sportswear, running shoes, running pockets and other equipment. You have decided to experience it before setting off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day after arriving in Tokyo, I woke up very early and took the subway to a runner service station I had found in advance. This service station is opened together with a restaurant. Since the charges are not high, runner service stations usually adopt a mixed operation method, allowing runners to stay for breakfast, or the service station is opened directly in the store of a famous sports brand. , increasing customer sources and boosting sales are all methods that service station operators have come up with after years of operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This service station has simple decoration, but it is clean and practical in Japanese style. The girl at the front desk is not good at English and does not have any English instructions at hand. It can be seen that the guests here are mainly Japanese locals and rarely receive tourists. After a few signs, it was not difficult to understand my purpose. I paid, received the keys and towels, and the rest was completely self-help. Later, the decoration of another service station I went to was obviously more upscale. The charges were similar, and both could apply for a monthly card. The price of the monthly card was basically the price of three single purchases, which was very cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second service station also cooperates with sports brands. There is a wall of Mizuno running shoes of different shoe sizes and a wall of Salomon racing road running shoes. Mizuno&#39;s running shoes are free to use, while Salomon&#39;s shoes are more expensive. The domestic price is 2,000 yuan, which only costs 100 yen. (About 5 yuan)&lt;/span>;You can try it out. Because of the good experience, I almost thought of buying a pair because of the 100 yen trial. It seems that this trial is indeed a clever sales method, and the sales scenario is very precise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/iGpztH37ua2aHx1xilIUbZz9bAhhYy153MCFgnXv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/iGpztH37ua2aHx1xilIUbZz9bAhhYy153MCFgnXv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258155&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Runner Service Station Locker Room&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Route around the Imperial Palace It is indeed very popular. There are many runners on weekend mornings, of all ages. You can tell the senior runners just by looking at their figures. Because Japan drives on the left and sidewalks are not very wide, everyone follows the rule of running counterclockwise to leave space for walkers. At first I thought it was out of consciousness, but later I learned that after the Imperial Palace route became very popular in 2004, more and more people were running. In order to regulate order, the government required that runners run counterclockwise in 2007. Others leave a certain way. If you violate the rules, you will probably be stopped by the guards around the Imperial Palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only by experiencing this route yourself will you know why it is the number one running route in Tokyo. In fact, it is also a helpless move. As an international city with a dense population and a high price of land, running conditions in the core area of ​​Tokyo are really limited. The dense road network leads to many traffic lights. The streets are narrow and even the greening is quite restrained. It is difficult to see rows of big trees. Therefore, the moat and dense vegetation around the Imperial Palace, as well as the five-kilometer &quot;runway&quot; that goes around the city without interruption, have become the best choice for Tokyoites who love running. The Ring Imperial Palace Line also has the advantage of being relatively smooth and convenient for public transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/LoLsuTivS9Yr2bvvMsRNibl8gthFsXpuUN5nu5eZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/LoLsuTivS9Yr2bvvMsRNibl8gthFsXpuUN5nu5eZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258159&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Private running group on the route around the Imperial Palace&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And The second route I chose to run on the same day was the loop around the Meiji Shrine outer garden mentioned by Haruki Murakami. “I have been used to running on this track for many years, and even the details are engraved in my mind. There are pits and depressions everywhere.” I remember everything clearly.&quot; Meiji Jingu Shrine is not far from the Imperial Palace. The map at the runner service station indicates that you can connect the two routes for a run. The total length is almost 10 kilometers, which is the favorite distance for many advanced runners. The route of Meiji Jingu Outer Garden has tall trees, denser green shade and cleaner scenery. It was here that Haruki Murakami met famous marathon runners preparing for the Olympics, rising long-distance running stars who died in traffic accidents, and beautiful women who smiled and greeted each other every day but never talked to each other. He also complained that there were too many traffic lights on this route, but luckily he could touch them. It was a bit of a relief to see all kinds of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/8M8ZEgN3d5lrAn4OIXvgwW4UjVh9iglaWlJzM1nF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/8M8ZEgN3d5lrAn4OIXvgwW4UjVh9iglaWlJzM1nF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258157&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Writer Haruki Murakami’s favorite route to Meiji Jingu Gaien&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;From historical opportunity to Hakone Ekiden&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I am running along the path of a writer, but there is no inspiration. The writer is also very honest, saying that most of his thoughts are wandering while running, and he even treats himself as a running machine without emotions. There are many well-known writers in the world, and there are even more tenacious runners, but Haruki Murakami seems to be the only one who has both and is familiar to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a reason why Japan has such a well-known writer who loves running. Long-distance running is a national sport in Japan. The promotion and development of long-distance running for hundreds of years has allowed Japanese runners to cover all age groups, with a large base and high level. It can be compared to table tennis in China or basketball in the United States. Among the six major marathons in the world, the Tokyo Marathon is known as an event with more &quot;private subsidies&quot; than &quot;official subsidies&quot;. People spontaneously provide free supplies to the participants along the way. The number is actually more than the supply stations prepared by the event organizer. The enthusiasm of Tokyoites is also related to the superior strength of local athletes. Several local athletes often break the 2 hours and 10 minutes mark. This result is on par with the world&#39;s top East African athletes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of marathon events in China has been in full swing in the past ten years. If you often browse the event registration app, you can find places to participate every month. Sometimes you just feel overwhelmed. If there is any gap between domestic marathon events and the world&#39;s &quot;Big Six&quot;, it is actually more at the cultural level, and there is no other way to form a culture but time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Thomas Havens, an American Japanese scholar, Japan sent two runners to participate in the marathon event at the Stockholm Olympic Games in 1912, which can be called the starting point of the marathon in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Japanese government at that time had limited financial resources and could only select two athletes to participate in the Olympics. The marathon is very similar to the long-distance running events that were held sporadically in the late Edo period. The purpose of these events was to &quot;improve the physical fitness of the people&quot; and to show that the Japanese could gain their own status in similar competitions in the West. This driving force, which combines national pride, proof of modernity, and an attitude of active participation in international competition, is the legacy of the Meiji Restoration of the same period. A famous example is a lively 12-hour running endurance race held in 1901 on the narrow track around Tokyo&#39;s Shinobazu Pond, which attracted more than a hundred competitors, 15 of whom completed 71 laps&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(103.6 kilometers)&lt;/span>;. Therefore, one of the last two Japanese athletes to participate in the 1912 Olympic Games was a marathon runner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the 1920s and 1930s, the Japanese were already among the fastest marathon runners in the world. After World War II, after decades of recuperation, from the 1960s to the 1980s, Japanese marathon runners returned to a dominant position in the world. In 1966, 15 of the top 17 results in the world rankings were created by Japanese male runners. By the 1990s, Japanese female marathon runners began to dominate the competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/eGqKlFUPUY3mB92p0O1ho9fWKjEsLzTttbo2qd38.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/eGqKlFUPUY3mB92p0O1ho9fWKjEsLzTttbo2qd38.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258156&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Promotional materials about various events and clubs in the runner service station&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;For a hundred years, Japan has been able to continue to dominate the world marathon field because of its large reserve of high-level private athletes. These high-level Japanese athletes have a more important platform for private events than the Olympic Games - Hakone Ekiden. The full name of Hakone Ekiden is &quot;Tokyo-Hakone Round-trip University Ekiden Race&quot;, which is a round trip between Tokyo and Hakone in the form of a half-marathon relay, with a total length of 217 kilometers and a total of ten stages. The units are based on each university. From the perspective of ratings, it is not an exaggeration to say that Hakone Ekiden is equivalent to the Japanese Spring Festival Gala. Since Nippon Television broadcast the entire Hakone Ekiden live in 1987, the ratings have remained at around 25%. You have to know that the entire game lasts for 12 hours. The ratings of China CCTV Spring Festival Gala in recent years have been just over 20%. Hakone Ekiden is arranged a few days before the New Year and is a great show that Japanese people can enjoy during the New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the TV series of the same name as the novel &quot;Strong Wind&quot; was released in Japan. This TV series is set in Hakone Ekiden and tells a passionate sports story about an unknown university long-distance running team that went through devilish training and counterattacked in the competition. , making more people aware of this Japanese sports event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The founder of Hakone Ekiden is the aforementioned Kanakuri Shizo, one of the marathon runners Japan sent to participate in the Stockholm Olympics. Kanakuri Shisan&#39;s first marathon Olympic trip was a tragedy. At that time, Japan used the whole country to send him and another sprinter to the Olympic Games. The travel expenses for each of the two athletes were equivalent to the thirty-six years of the prestigious Waseda University. tuition fees. However, the expectations of the people across the country and the fatigue of the journey overwhelmed him. The heat on the day of the competition was extremely hot. One Portuguese athlete even fell to the ground and died. Kanali No. 3 also lost consciousness during the journey and was carried home by local farmers. When he woke up, he was After the game the next day. He later participated in two Olympic Games, with his best result being 16th. Looking back now, the return on the cost of tuition fees at prestigious universities in the past thirty-six years has been too generous, and Kanakuri Shisan has become a leader in the development of marathons in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1920, the first Hakone Ekiden was held between four universities including Waseda University and Meiji University. Except for the suspension during the two world wars, 99 sessions have been held so far. This competition will be the first in 2024 centenary event. Hakone Ekiden has provided a large number of world-class athletes for Japanese marathons. Among them, Osako Kei, the most familiar to Chinese running enthusiasts, has captured a large number of fans because of his handsome appearance and elegant running posture. He was once a student at Waseda University in Hakone Ekiden. An elite runner who still holds the domestic marathon record in Japan. Many of the current college runners are well-known celebrities. People take the train and rush to the viewing point in advance like chasing stars, waiting for several hours in the cold wind of the New Year. There will be tens of thousands of spectators waiting at the finish line, saying &quot;congratulations&quot; and &quot; &quot;Thank you for your hard work&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re already great&quot;. As the players passed the finish line one by one, such shouts came one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As long as you have a slight idea of ​​marathon results, browsing the Hakone Ekiden stage results every year is simply staggering, especially in 2023, when many long-standing records for stages were broken. Someone asked on &quot;Zhihu&quot; if the ten best amateur long-distance runners in China were selected to form a team, and it was not limited to college students, would they be able to enter the top ten of Hakone Ekiden? The answer is regrettable. After converting the same distance Afterwards, this team could only finish 15th in Hakone Ekiden that same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, to quote a data, from November 23 to 25, 2012, a total of six full marathons were held across Japan. A total of 77,772 runners completed the race. The completion rate in five of the six races exceeded 90 %. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/SncyVY9nj9L27yumGNuBesGoiIbrQ7FFHFrVsbGy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/SncyVY9nj9L27yumGNuBesGoiIbrQ7FFHFrVsbGy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258161&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;People preparing for activities in front of the runner service station&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;&lt;strong>;Government and Business&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Conspiracy”, Beginning with Yasuhiro Nakasone&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Long distance running is boring and grueling, 1990 The &quot;Ma Jiajun&quot;, which led the domestic middle and long-distance running events in the 1990s, recruited mostly team members from ordinary families in small and medium-sized cities. They relied on hard work, the ability to endure hardship, and won a place in society through sports performance. But marathon has been an elite sport in Japan since its beginning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hakone Ekiden first unfolded among four prestigious universities including Waseda University. As part of the rise of the nation and nationalism, these elite college students became the main force. This gene has been running through the development of Japanese marathon for nearly a hundred years. To this day, Japan&#39;s famous universities are still sending young people to the marathon. After graduation, these college students usually enter well-known Japanese companies and join professional runners sponsored by the companies. The team represents the company in various competitions at home and abroad to win glory for the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned Osako Jie joined the Nissin Industrial Running Group after graduating from Waseda University. However, joining a corporate running team means that corporate interests come first. Companies may even require athletes to sacrifice preparation time for international competitions such as the Olympics and give priority to domestic competitions in Japan. Therefore, many top athletes, including Osako Kei, ultimately chose to withdraw from corporate running groups in order to dominate their sports careers. After Kei Osako quit Nissin Industries and joined the Oregon Project sponsored by Nike, there were still many voices in Japanese society calling him a &quot;traitor&quot;. However, as he achieved excellent results in the international arena, these criticisms have become past tense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the process of the Japanese marathon movement from state dominance to market dominance, one person cannot be avoided - former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. Yasuhiro Nakasone is a highly controversial figure both for China and Japan. He once participated in the war of aggression against China as an officer. However, in the early days of China&#39;s reform and opening up, he strongly urged Japan to provide financial guarantees for China&#39;s export trade at that time. Without Japan guarantee, it would be even more difficult to obtain international loan financing given China&#39;s economic conditions at the time. He visited the Yasukuni Shrine and later apologized for Japan&#39;s war of aggression against China. But if you dig deeper into the core of his character, you will find that it all stems from his pragmatism. He once said: &quot;When asked what you did in post-war democracy, I can answer that I worked desperately to develop political methods in line with the era of mass democracy, and the patent for its secrets belongs to me.&quot; As a way to cater to public opinion He is a master of Japan. During his tenure as prime minister, he completed the &quot;division and nationalization of Japan&#39;s national railways&quot;. He dismantled Japan&#39;s national railways, which were once part of Japan&#39;s state monopoly, and operated them in a corporatized manner. Nowadays, you often see &quot;JR&quot; when traveling to Japan. &quot;East Japan&quot;, &quot;JR West&quot;, &quot;JR Hokkaido&quot;, etc. are all companies spun off from Japan National Railways. According to Nakasone Yasuhiro&#39;s pragmatism, these were all part of his efforts to cater to public opinion. As he said, Japan was already in an era of mass democracy at that time, and he pushed for this to happen faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave of privatization, the sports industry that was originally dominated by the Japanese state has gradually been handed over to the market. In the 1970s, the Japan Amateur Sports Association (JASA), which once believed that business would corrode the spirit of sports, began to allow Olympic athletes to appear in television advertisements, and the fees received were divided between the athletes&#39; companies and JASA. Advertising giant Dentsu organized a Japan Go campaign in 1979 to support the following year&#39;s Moscow Olympics. This kind of sponsorship of sports events by big companies became more popular in the 1980s, and athletes&#39; incomes also increased. After the Japanese real estate bubble burst in 1991, government finances were further tightened, and the marketization of sports was accelerated. To this end, the Japanese government also formulated a series of tax incentive policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Against this series of historical backgrounds, the marathon has been a sports event that Japan hopes to have an impact on the world since 1912. After a hundred years of development, it has gradually completed commercialization. This is also the trend and trend of world sports development: attracting the interest and social capital of the whole people through commercial methods, and selecting top talents on the basis of mass sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2007, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government defeated the business consortium with vested interests in the elite marathon event, and also calmed the Tokyo Police Department’s concerns that the marathon would greatly disrupt urban order. The first Tokyo Tokyo Olympics was funded by the government. Marathon. Now, the Tokyo Marathon is one of the six major international marathon events in the world. You must know that the Boston Marathon, one of the &quot;big six&quot;, started in 1897. The Tokyo Marathon has brought huge influence and commercial benefits to the city &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (more than 150 million U.S. dollars per year)&lt;/span>; and has become a competition for governments across Japan. The objects of imitation, Osaka Marathon, Kobe Marathon, Yokohama Marathon, and Hokkaido Marathon, have now become events with many domestic and foreign participants, and each time you need to draw lots to register. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/fiLBn71yrJJIKEVF2OVbgeeWHlXkdpxRdCc4gfza.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;622&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/fiLBn71yrJJIKEVF2OVbgeeWHlXkdpxRdCc4gfza.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258162&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Have an aerobic jog in Tokyo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course , a huge successful conspiracy between government and business must have provided some kind of social necessity. During the &quot;lost thirty years&quot; of Japan&#39;s economy, long-distance running became a way to inspire the national spirit and an antidote to spiritual dilemmas. This antidote not only acts on the body, producing pleasant dopamine and endorphins, building a healthy body that can cope with the high intensity of modern life, but it also acts on the mind, dealing with the emptiness that comes after the hardships of life with great material prosperity and lack. Just like Haruki Murakami&#39;s favorite saying: Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. He said, &quot;Really valuable things can often be obtained through very inefficient operations. Even if this is an illusory behavior, it is by no means a stupid behavior. I think so as a practical feeling as a rule of thumb.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In short, everyone who loves running can refer to the epitaph designed by Haruki Murakami for himself: &quot;He at least ran to the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[FF三季度卖车3辆，收入55.1万美元]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260579]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 14, Faraday Futere (FF) released its third quarter financial report for 2023.

Of this amount, $10.4 million was depreciation on tools and equipment, and most of the remainder was manufacturing overhead, followed by labor and material costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;FF explained that the higher cost of sales is due to the natural inefficiencies of early vehicle production - that is, the higher cost of parts caused by initial manufacturing inefficiencies and low output. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, FF was still in the red in the third quarter, with a net loss of approximately US$78 million, which was narrower than the net loss of US$119 million in the same period last year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of cash flow, in the first three quarters of this year, FF&#39;s operating activities generated net cash outflows of US$240 million, compared with US$355 million in the same period last year; capital expenditures were US$10.8 million, compared with US$112 million in the same period last year; financing activities The net cash inflow generated was US$237.6 million, while the net cash outflow from financing activities in the same period last year was US$40.9 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the third quarter, FF raised a total of US$61.8 million through convertible notes, equity line of credit (ELOC) and ATM financing. As of September 30, 2023, FF&#39;s cash balance was $8.567 million, including $1.853 million in restricted cash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the future, FF said that the company plans to start the third phase of delivery at the end of the first quarter of 2024, that is, to fully deliver vehicles to users. According to the current factory improvement and ramp-up plan, FF&#39;s goal next year is to achieve a production of approximately 1,000 vehicles, but FF also admitted that this is subject to obtaining the required capital, the capacity and stability of the supply chain, and obtaining the necessary licenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[丢下铁饭碗，出走围城丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260559]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;November 11, 2023, Kunming, as the national examination and postgraduate entrance examination are approaching, candidates have a weekend Come to Yunnan Provincial Library for review.

One works in a community in Beijing, with a monthly salary of more than 8,000 yuan, and has a Beijing household registration; the other stayed in Shandong and went to the CPPCC unit, which is also within the system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a former student from Shandong, in the first twenty years of my life, there was a saying that was repeatedly emphasized in my family, &quot;Knowledge changes destiny.&quot; How to understand? I think if there are simulation games for raising children, then my parents’ goal must be for their children to enter a good university and then choose one of the two good jobs of teachers and civil servants. Unfortunately, reality is biased. When he learned that I was not admitted to a major such as administration in the college entrance examination, my dad clearly expressed his disappointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For a long time, the pursuit of the system and the iron rice bowl has been one of the labels for us Shandong people. Until recent years, young people across the country have People also spontaneously fall in love with taking public exams and taking exams for editors. Stability is the most mentioned advantage of this job. The pseudonym in the report is Meng Cheng, a 35-year-old returnee man who joined the editor and then resigned to study for a PhD. This is how he was attracted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The starting point of the story is as usual. He was worried that the employment environment would require more and more academic qualifications. Between studying for a Ph.D. and finding a job, Meng Cheng chose the latter and went smoothly. Obtained a career establishment in a poor county in Guangxi. Unfortunately, this job that I started with great expectations was described as a &quot;siege&quot; when I left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department wrote in the post, it was called Tourism Development Center. I was quite happy and thought I could participate in tourism projects.&quot; On the day of joining the job, Meng Cheng learned that &quot;separation of staff and staff&quot; was implemented in talent introduction, and he was actually assigned to the general office. &quot;Because when you are recruited, you must be assigned an establishment, so the Organization Department collected some empty establishments from the units.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the general office, one of Meng Cheng’s most feared tasks is organizing documents. “For example, if the municipal level publishes a document on the tourism market rectification plan, we will If you want to produce a county-level document, you can copy part of the city-level document, but you can&#39;t copy it all. You have to read it carefully.&quot; From writing to finalizing, it is common to spend a day and a half digging for a few words. What troubles him even more is that for things like writing documents, there is no clear operational process. “A lot of times it’s just casual remarks from the leader.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is still a lot of suffering in the besieged city. During the interview, we met a girl who had been working in the system for five years through talent introduction. The idea of ​​resigning had been lingering in her mind for more than three years, although she did not appear in the manuscript in the end. But I think her summary of the reasons for her resignation should represent the voice of the vast majority of people who want to leave the system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Recent master&#39;s degree graduates should be graded as a fourth-level chief clerk, but my unit assigned me a first-grade chief clerk until now. Join me in introducing Most of the students who came here were appointed as fourth-level chief clerks, and this year they were promoted to third-level chief clerks, which made me feel very unbalanced. On the other hand, the work in the system is more service-oriented and coordination-oriented, and the professional basics There is no use, no sense of gain, and no creativity. Just listen to your superiors and just be an obedient person. Over time, you will no longer be able to think independently. In addition, there is a serious age gap among employees, and the phenomenon of seniority is serious, and hard work is difficult. In the past two years, senior comrades have been considered first for promotions, and most of the energy has been spent on how to push out the work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent times, I have seen my close friends around me I couldn’t find a job everywhere, and I did a lot of job-related topics. I have been thinking that since childhood, the education we have received has cultivated individuals to become intellectually rich through a simple stimulus-reward mechanism. , but rarely teaches us how to grow into a complete self, and what to do next when the school education a person can receive comes to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, at the point of graduating from undergraduate or graduate school, some people throw themselves into society hastily, doing jobs they don’t understand or even dislike. Not getting affirmation, they repeatedly question their personal value; others turn around and hide in school, delaying the time to make a decision. These are all detours taken by talents who are introduced to the county and then leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Meng Cheng&#39;s view, leaving the system means leaving the siege, but is there a siege outside the siege? When can the layers of walls be demolished? Losing money may be a more complex social issue than personal choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孩子被欺负，该打回去吗？谈谈我对孩子的勇气教育]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260544]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;My son, who is in fifth grade, got into a fight at school. When my wife told me, my first reaction was surprise. My son has been mild-mannered since he was a child, not competitive, and rarely conflicts with other children. Before the fifth grade, he had never had a fight. The most he had was an argument and a few angry words. My wife and I occasionally worry: We have been competitive for half our lives, and our children will not be bullied if they have such a bad temper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a naughty little boy in the class who loves to tease others. He is strong and full of energy, and other students cannot stop him. My son occasionally complains: This classmate is very annoying and always teases him and touches him. At first we couldn&#39;t hear the big problem, so we didn&#39;t take it seriously. It is normal for boys to collide with each other. If there is no fight or trouble, we as parents will not interfere deeply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My son complained several times. One day, my wife and I told him: &quot;If the teacher can&#39;t control things, you can solve them yourself. If it doesn&#39;t work, just call him back and don&#39;t let others bully you.&quot; The complaints stopped for a few days, and we almost forgot about this little incident. Unexpectedly, my son actually got into a fight. This was the first real fight between him and his classmates since he went to school, and he was the one who started the fight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cause of the incident is very simple: a group of boys were playing in the dormitory, and the usually naughty boy was teased by a certain child and became irritated. The son was also present, and the boy threw an unknown anger at him, swearing and pushing him. The son angrily demanded an apology, but the other classmate refused, so the son punched the classmate in the face, and the two struggled, and then the teacher arrived and took the two away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We told him that if someone scolds you, just scold him back. How can you hit someone? My son’s answer was that he used to scold him, but that classmate was even better at scolding him. He scolded him again and again, and he was caught twice by the teacher. Not only was he scolded, but he was also made to stand in the classroom. It was so frustrating. &quot;What are you scolding each other?&quot; &quot;He called me stupid, and I called him stupid.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remembering it, the teacher did mention this matter, but he just downplayed it, and we didn&#39;t take it too seriously. pay attention to. When we reminded our son at that time, my wife and I secretly complained: The day has come when the child curses. It seems like this has been going on for two or three months. After a long period of patience and protest, the son finally broke out and rushed towards the strong classmate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After talking to our children, my wife and I were filled with shame and fear. We communicate a lot with our children. In order to give our children room to grow, we don’t pay attention to certain small snippets we hear, and ignore the children’s repeated calls for help. His character was originally gentle, but he endured restraint for a long time, leaving a &quot;weak&quot; impression on his classmates (who took it out on him when they were angered), and he was on the verge of being &quot;bullied&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, the son launched a timely counterattack and prevented the situation from getting worse. This incident also surprised the classmates around him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For his first fight, my wife and I did not blame him, but fell into self-reflection. Reflect on the negligence of parents and the key points of educating children. But one thing is very lucky: we always encourage him to have the courage to have conflicts with classmates, not to be submissive, timid, and have to compromise, but to dare to express anger. It can be seen that this kind of teaching has worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We teach him this way largely because his character is too gentle and needs some &quot;blessing&quot;. A little boy can have no temper, but he must have strength. In order to protect our own rights and dignity, we do not object to children fighting among themselves. It is wrong to actively bully others. Hitting back when bullied is a form of defense and can also establish an effective deterrent. The child asked that time, what should I do if I can’t beat him? Wife&#39;s quick answer: If you can&#39;t beat him, you have to beat him, at least to make him think that you are not easy to mess with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through this incident, we revised a combat &quot;guideline&quot; for children: in the future, if a classmate uses swear words, laughs at you, or insults you, do not use swear words against him. Ask the other person to stop and apologize. If the other person repeatedly refuses to apologize, you can teach him a lesson. It doesn&#39;t matter if you can&#39;t win. If the teacher criticizes you, your parents will bear with you. Don&#39;t get into dirty talk with classmates, it&#39;s too ugly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There must be many people who disagree with this educational concept. Chinese people have always been gentle, courteous, thrifty and accommodating in their interactions. The rules and legal regulations for adults also say that &quot;a gentleman talks but does not use his hands&quot; and &quot;the one who strikes first is at fault.&quot; I don’t need to teach you these principles. Children will gradually understand them as they grow up. We value the education of courage, a quality that is more important than daily academic performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Courage is valuable because it allows children to build daily self-confidence and have the courage to explore and discover; it allows children to get rid of troubles, get rid of worries, and develop a sunny and cheerful personality. When children are in adversity, they can still think and make decisions instead of running away from difficulties, which is conducive to developing the quality of distinguishing right from wrong. It is no accident that a person with courage is often smart and upright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Courage education is certainly not about encouraging children to abuse violence or actively bully others with violence. Allowing children to fight should be limited to conflict resolution, not bullying of classmates. You need to express your anger and give a warning before taking action, rather than fighting randomly. A few simple rules can be understood by children. This kind of reasoning and exchange is far more conducive to improving children&#39;s understanding of the world than a crude prohibition of &quot;fighting is wrong.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teaching children to develop courage is actually not easy. It is inevitable for adults to be submissive, but children are weak and often isolated. At this time, they need help from adults (especially parents). After understanding the reason for our son&#39;s fight, we stated the facts to the teacher and expressed our support for the child. The two parents met, apologized and understood, and the matter was resolved satisfactorily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Children fighting&quot; actually does not require much input from parents. The biggest pressure that children face every day comes from school. Teachers misunderstand punishments, cage management during breaks, and unnecessary extracurricular tasks... These need to be examined by parents and help their children withstand the pressure. My wife and I will help our child complete the assigned tasks and reassure him: It&#39;s not your fault that you didn&#39;t do it well, and it doesn&#39;t matter if the teacher asks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Family is the most important place for children to grow, and parents are their best teachers. Courage, integrity, cheerfulness, optimism... these qualities are difficult to learn in school, and may even be erased. Parents need to take responsibility at this time and pass on values ​​to their children. This is not only character education for children, but also a process of constant reflection and re-growth for parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访世界银行原副行长祝宪：中国发展历程是不同于西方的现代化“药方”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260569]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 13:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As the largest source of funds for developing countries, the World Bank’s economic forecast reports and economic warnings have always attracted much attention . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1980, the third year of reform and opening up, China restored its representation and membership status in the World Bank, and received its first loan from the World Bank the following year. In the following thirty years, China became a protagonist on the world economic stage due to its reform and opening up. It transformed from a borrower of the World Bank to a major shareholder and played an important role in global economic cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China is also the third largest shareholder of the Asian Development Bank (&quot;ADB&quot;) and one of the initiators of the BRICS New Development Bank (&quot;New Development Bank&quot;). By participating in multiple international financial institutions, including the World Bank, China has integrated into the international economic order. After regaining its seat in the World Bank, what else did China get besides loans? As the status of the World Bank continues to improve, what has China contributed to the World Bank? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Xian, who is currently the Executive Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the International Financial Forum (IFF), has served in the Ministry of Finance for a long time, and has successively served as China’s Executive Director of the World Bank, Vice President and Chief Ethics Officer of the World Bank He is the official, vice president and chief operating officer of the BRICS New Development Bank. He is a witness to my country’s long-term cooperation with international financial institutions such as the World Bank. He is also an experienced promoter of my country’s introduction of international funds to accelerate domestic innovation after reform and opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the &quot;IFF 20th Anniversary Global Annual Conference&quot; held recently, Zhu Xian accepted an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend and said that the World Bank plays an important role in China&#39;s reform and opening up process, not only providing loans, but also playing an important role in policy Suggestions, institutional innovation and talent cultivation play an important role, and their role cannot be ignored. At the same time, the World Bank began to promote China&#39;s successful experience in reform and opening up, because China&#39;s development process is different from the Western &quot;prescription&quot; for modernization. This is a very important reference for other developing countries. China also actively participates in global governance through international organizations and tells China&#39;s story to the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Xian also emphasized that China’s reform and opening up must continue to move forward, relying on innovation and becoming an indispensable part of the world economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/CVbbOeohfYI9YrRiI9o7LXuesKxQ9Q4HWb43a4EE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;766&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/CVbbOeohfYI9YrRiI9o7LXuesKxQ9Q4HWb43a4EE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258178&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhu Xian: Former Vice President and Chief Ethics Officer of the World Bank, former Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the New Development Bank; currently Executive Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the International Financial Forum. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;First opening&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;International&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong >;Pioneering bidding system&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1980, China resumed A legal seat at the World Bank (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;World Bank&quot;). Information shows that at the beginning of reform and opening up, the cooperative relationship between China and the World Bank was mainly about receiving aid. You were working in the Ministry of Finance at the time and served successively as deputy director of the World Bank Department, deputy director of the National Debt Department and director of the International Department, etc., so you became closely associated with the World Bank. What was the first project China received assistance from the World Bank? What is the historical background? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China is a founding member of the World Bank. In April 1980, Robert Strange McNamara, then President of the World Bank, was invited to visit China and was received by Deng Xiaoping. Deng Xiaoping said a very famous and courageous saying at that time, &quot;We have fallen behind these years, and we have to catch up. I hope the World Bank can help us, but even without this help, we are determined to catch up.&quot; This was Comrade Xiaoping&#39;s words. The original words are also a tone-setting speech. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, China resumed its legal seat in the World Bank. In July of the same year, the World Bank sent its first high-level delegation to China for inspection and subsequently submitted a detailed inspection report to the World Bank Board of Directors. This is the first step for the World Bank to launch a loan project in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Lubuge&quot; Hydropower Station was China&#39;s first project using World Bank loans and implementing international bidding in the early 1980s. As a key national construction project of the year, the &quot;Lubuge&quot; Hydropower Station is known as the &quot;window&quot; for China&#39;s hydropower capital construction projects to open to the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to obtaining a loan, what changes has this project brought? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the era of planned economy, China’s infrastructure construction projects were mainly established through mandatory plans. After receiving financial allocations or budget allocations, Construction of designated state-owned enterprises. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to the loan agreement signed with the World Bank, some projects in Lubuge must implement international bidding. This was a completely new thing at the time, and of course there was resistance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I happened to work in the Ministry of Finance in 1984. At that time, with the help of the World Bank, a total of engineering contractors from 8 countries, including state-owned enterprises, participated in the bidding. In the end, Japan&#39;s Dachen Company won the bid, and the winning price was 43% lower than the lowest bid price. After entering the company, it only sent a management team of more than 30 people and used the &quot;on-site recruitment&quot; model to form a construction team of more than 400 people. It managed the company according to a contract system and paid workers according to their work efficiency. This changed the “big pot” model of state-owned enterprises at that time. Workers are no longer paid the same amount, but are distributed according to their work. In the end, not only the construction cost was greatly reduced, but the construction efficiency was also greatly improved, and the project progress was significantly accelerated. The project was completed in 1986, five months ahead of schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the introduction of foreign advanced equipment, technology and management experience, the &quot;Lubuge&quot; hydropower station project has become a benchmark for my country&#39;s infrastructure construction to open to the outside world. In 1987, the State Council held a special meeting to require the comprehensive promotion of the &quot;Lu Buge Experience&quot; in the construction industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident later became known as the &quot;Lu Buge Shock&quot;. It is the first of its kind in China to launch global bidding, with price, efficiency and quality as its core assessments. It’s not just the World Bank loan we received, but more importantly these institutional changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Help China&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Promote market reform&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to being the first to launch a bidding system, what profound impact has the &quot;Lu Buge Experience&quot; had on China&#39;s reform and opening up? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From the perspective of project management and financing conditions, the &quot;Lubuge Experience&quot; has influenced China&#39;s infrastructure construction for more than 30 years since then. . The bidding system has since been gradually promoted in the country, and today almost all major infrastructure projects in the public budget must go through bidding. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of the World Bank, the impact on China from the 1980s to the 1990s was not only the provision of loans, but also a lot of pioneering work in institutional innovation and talent training. It played an important role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From my experience, this role is no less important than providing loan funds, especially during the transition from a planned economy to a market economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In what aspects is this importance mainly reflected? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time we didn’t quite know how to transform the socialist market economy. The World Bank conducted a comprehensive investigation of the Chinese economy and then wrote targeted recommendations and reports, some of which were praised by the top leadership at the time. The World Bank also recommended that governments at all levels, especially central ministries and commissions such as the Ministry of Finance, the People&#39;s Bank of China and the National Development and Reform Commission, carry out institutional innovation, which has had a relatively large impact. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, in the process of dealing with international organizations such as the World Bank, our country has also trained a group of market reform talents. For example, Zhou Xiaochuan, Lou Jiwei, etc. all gained their knowledge during exchanges with the World Bank and played an important role in market reform. I was still relatively young at the time, but I also got exercise during my exchanges with the World Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, not all World Bank recommendations are in line with China&#39;s national conditions, but many of the policy recommendations put forward at that time were based on economic surveys conducted in China, as well as exchanges with domestic officials and scholars, and after comparison with international experience.

With the reform and opening up, while your personal role is changing, China&#39;s status in the World Bank is also improving. During your tenure at the World Bank, if you looked at China from a different perspective, what would be the differences? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After the restoration of the legal seat of the World Bank, as a major country, China has obtained a seat on the executive director, joining the United Nations permanent members such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Like the Governing Council members, they have separate offices at the World Bank. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a sense, the Executive Director of the World Bank is an official sent by China, not an official of the World Bank itself. Before and after I took office, many people held this position, such as Li Yong and Zhang Shengman before me, and Zhu Guangyao and Zou Jiayi after me. I feel very honored to be able to perform my duties at the World Bank on behalf of my motherland, and it is also a heavy responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the improvement of comprehensive national strength, China’s influence in the World Bank has gradually expanded. The World Bank began to promote China&#39;s successful experience in reform and opening up, firstly, to get rid of absolute poverty, and secondly, to promote the transformation of the planned economy into a socialist market economy through infrastructure construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very important reference for other developing countries. At the same time, China is also actively participating in global governance and telling China’s story to the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What milestone events remain fresh in your memory? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;During my tenure at the World Bank, there were two milestone events that impressed me deeply: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;First, China’s loan scale from the World Bank reached US$3 billion per year for the first time. That was $3 billion more than thirty years ago. The World Bank&#39;s low-cost funds have become one of the most important channels for my country to introduce foreign investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using these funds, our country built a number of major infrastructure projects at that time. For example, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Expressway connecting Beijing and Tianjin was my country’s first inter-provincial and municipal expressway built with World Bank loans. This is the first project in China to introduce the construction of a supervisory system. The World Bank insists on giving priority to quality, strictly controls the progress and quality of the project, and will not sign for payment if it does not meet the standards, thus avoiding potential quality hazards caused by the rush period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, China has experienced a change in its role from a borrower to an important shareholder. In 1999, when I first joined the World Bank, China still ranked sixth in terms of voting rights. Now China has become the third largest shareholder of the World Bank. Although we still borrow money from the World Bank, as an important shareholder of the World Bank, our participation in the international financial market has gradually increased, and our influence on world economic development has gradually increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend: From a borrower to an important shareholder, how does China currently influence the world economy through the World Bank? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Xian: Compared with developed countries as shareholders, China’s role in the World Bank is different. For other developing countries, China&#39;s successful experience in reform and opening up has strong reference significance. Because China itself is a developing country, China&#39;s development process is different from the Western &quot;prescription&quot; for modernization, providing more practical experience in poverty alleviation and infrastructure construction. Therefore, China plays an increasingly important role in maintaining the international economic order and improving the global governance structure, and its influence in international organizations such as the World Bank is growing. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Compared with the World Bank, the New Development Bank has made breakthroughs and innovations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have successively held leadership positions in the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (referred to as &quot;ADB&quot;) and the BRICS New Development Bank (referred to as &quot;New Development Bank&quot;). How does China exert its influence and role through different international financial organizations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are two reasons why I moved from the World Bank to the Asian Development Bank: First, we had fewer senior staff in international organizations at that time; And ADB happens to have a spot. Because I have experience working in the World Bank, the Ministry of Finance recommended me for an interview. Second, my professional ability in participating in promoting the World Bank&#39;s poverty alleviation project in western China has been recognized by all aspects of the World Bank. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this is the general background that China has been highly recognized by international organizations such as the World Bank because of its reform and opening up. Without China&#39;s reform and opening up, there would be no experience for me and Chinese people like me in international organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From my personal experience, working in the Ministry of Finance in the first half and working in multilateral international organizations in the second half are completely different experiences. I have witnessed China transform from a poor and backward country to the second largest in the world. the entire process of the economy. The experience of working in an international organization, especially promoting China&#39;s experience to other developing countries and promoting the development of poverty alleviation, is a very glorious career for me. In this process, the biggest challenge is how to balance maintaining Chinese characteristics and integrating with international standards. I hope this will attract the attention of young people currently working in international organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The BRICS New Development Bank was officially established in Shanghai in 2015. China is one of the five largest shareholder countries and one of the initiators. Compared with the World Bank and AIIB, what innovations does it have? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;According to the agreement between the five major shareholder countries at the beginning of the establishment of the New Development Bank, the first president will be an Indian, and the other four shareholders will Each country appoints a vice president. As the vice president in charge of business at that time, the first problem I faced was to clarify what kind of services the new bank would provide. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with multilateral international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, the New Development Bank was entirely initiated and established by emerging market countries. However, the main business nature of the New Development Bank is different from that of multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank. The institutions are relatively similar, and the clients are mainly developing countries. Therefore, we decided to learn from the good experiences and practices of the World Bank and ADB in related business fields, while avoiding the bureaucracy and efficiency problems common in international institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to be different from the World Bank&#39;s practice of attaching policy conditions when approving loan applications from developing countries, we proposed not to set loan conditions at the beginning of the establishment of the New Development Bank and respect the policies of different applicant countries. At the same time, in terms of &quot;environmental and social security policies&quot; and other aspects, the New Development Bank innovatively adopts a &quot;domestic system&quot; and implements it in accordance with the borrowing country&#39;s own lending policy. It is no longer like traditional multilateral financial institutions that impose a &quot;one size fits all&quot; policy on all borrowing countries. &quot;Acceptance effectively reduces the time and cost of borrowing countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another innovation is the adoption of &quot;local currency loans.&quot; Since the New Development Bank&#39;s funds mainly come from the local currencies of the five major shareholder countries rather than US dollars, the New Development Bank&#39;s loans are basically invested in the infrastructure of the host country. If these infrastructures generate income, its income will basically come from the host country and be in the form of It is reflected in the form of the country&#39;s local currency. Therefore, if the country borrows RMB and repays it in US dollars, it will create exchange rate risk. If you borrow local currency and repay local currency, there will be no exchange rate risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although compared with &quot;old banks&quot; such as the World Bank and Asia, the New Development Bank still needs to continue to work hard in many aspects, during my five-year term, the loan scale of the New Development Bank has increased from 0 to 0. $30 billion, pretty good. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;High-end service industry should have characteristics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(IFF) was initiated and established by leaders of more than 20 countries and regions including China, the United States, Britain, and Japan, as well as relevant international organizations and global financial institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It is known as &quot;F20&quot;, its permanent venue is located in Nansha, Guangzhou. What role will IFF play in the integrated development and high-level opening up of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;IFF settling in Guangzhou is a mutual achievement. The Greater Bay Area has a developed economy and a high degree of marketization and internationalization, while IFF is globally representative and inclusive. This is also the significance of IFF settling in the Greater Bay Area and Guangzhou, to build a platform for non-governmental exchanges between scholars and enterprises. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Nansha, Guangzhou, Hengqin, Zhuhai and Qianhai, Shenzhen Finance is at the forefront of China&#39;s reform and opening up. What are your expectations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From a development perspective, Guangzhou should focus not only on investment in the real economy, but also on investment in the service industry, especially in areas such as finance. High-end service industry. In the past, manufacturing industry could attract foreign investment by demarcating a certain area with tax exemptions and other preferential treatment, but it is different now. The service industry needs to be opened up and needs institutional construction. The service industry differs from manufacturing in that services are more mobile. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, institutional openness means integrating with international standards. Now when local governments at all levels consider attracting foreign investment, they should not only focus on the manufacturing industry, but also the service industry, and need to explore new institutional opening-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also hope that the forum can make a contribution, at least to promote dialogue between the two parties. For example, the Nansha District government hopes to attract investment through us, but we suggest that manufacturing investment is no longer urgent for Nansha District, and what Guangdong needs now is not just manufacturing. While the manufacturing industry should be upgraded, investment in the service industry should have its own characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What special finance do you think should be developed in the Greater Bay Area? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The Greater Bay Area has huge demand for financial services. Greater Bay Area finance not only includes traditional bank loans and capital operations, but also digital finance and green financial services. In the process of continuous economic integration in the Greater Bay Area, we will provide enterprises with a full range of financial services, innovate in connectivity, and help the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area become a world-class bay area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area must become a world-class bay District, what do you suggest? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Xian:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is still a long way to go for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to become a world-class bay area. First of all, compared with the Yangtze River Delta, the Greater Bay Area has institutional advantages, namely the three legal systems of &quot;one country, two systems&quot;. Secondly, dare to innovate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not just the Greater Bay Area. As China continues to move forward, it must rely on reform and opening up, rely on innovation, and become an indispensable part of the world economy. To correctly understand &quot;double circulation&quot;, &quot;inner circulation&quot; and &quot;external circulation&quot; are an organic whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, geographical factors cannot be ignored. The achievements China has made today are the direct result of reform and opening up. In other words, under the new situation, both cooperation and competition are needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国足球的“12岁退役”现象]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260557]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/14/7cca7c7bf41d87e4925b98a3d0ee722d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/14/7cca7c7bf41d87e4925b98a3d0ee722d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258167&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The phenomenon of &quot;retiring at the age of 12&quot; is something that Chinese football, which is full of opportunities, has to face painfully and deeply. A question of powerlessness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the U13 competition of the Key Cities Group of the Chinese Football Association Youth Football Championship (referred to as the &quot;Key City Group Competition&quot;) held in Qingdao at the end of October, tournament officials, coaches, and parents discussed this topic hotly and eagerly sought answers. A competition supervisor from Beijing told reporters that he deplored the changes in a youth team he had followed in the &quot;Hundred Teams Cup&quot; competition in Beijing in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Those 10- and 11-year-old kids can play football better than we did when we were kids, but by the age of 12, half of the kids disappeared; by the time they were 13, they couldn’t play football anymore. He left. I went to ask the coach: &#39;Where are the people?&#39; He said that he spent four years training those children, and they just got a little bit in shape. When they entered junior high school, the team was disbanded.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; &#39;Retiring at the age of 12&#39; is a phenomenon unique to us. If this problem is not solved, youth training will be cut in half and it will be difficult to achieve results,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Since the widespread introduction of campus football, the number of players playing football has increased sharply in primary schools, but by the junior high school stage, that is, after the age of 12, there has been a sharp decline. &lt;/span>;This phenomenon appeared as early as 2018, when the organizers of the Beijing “100 Team Cup” announced a set of numbers about participating teams: there were 229 participating teams in the U8 and U9 primary school age groups, while U13 and U15 There are only 70 participating teams in the middle school age group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Last year, reporters went to Xi&#39;an for research. The person in charge of the youth training of a local district and county football association said that among the echelons affiliated to their football association, there were more than 50 children in the U8 echelon; more than 20 in the U10 team; and only 10 in the U12 team. The left and right children cannot form a team alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A local youth training coach said that parents’ choice determines whether their children play football and also determines the quality of the youth training. He said: &quot;In the past, when we played football, our parents supported us, and the time spent playing football every day was longer than the time spent studying. Now it is just the opposite, and parents focus on studying. &lt;span>; There is no shortage of children with football talents in China. What is the support of parents? All are important. The future of Chinese football is in the hands of parents.&lt;/span>;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Parents&#39; concerns&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen U13 women&#39;s football captain Lian Yutong every day Every time you go out to compete, one of your parents must accompany you. This time it was her father who accompanied her to Qingdao to participate in the key city group competition. He carried a projector from Shenzhen, not to play game videos, but to give his children online classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When the child comes out to compete, as long as conditions permit, her mother and I will definitely have someone accompany her, mainly to provide her with extra lessons.&quot; Lian Lian said, &quot;The child is only 13 years old and does not have that much self-discipline. She is strong, someone must supervise her to study during the competition. The pressure to study in junior high school is too great.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/14/0877d562f74bc96a41ede72c6915244c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/11/14/0877d562f74bc96a41ede72c6915244c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258168&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;April 15, 2023, Lian Yu Tong practices shooting at Shenzhen Baoan Stadium. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Mao Siqian&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lian Lian said that Lian Yutong started playing football in the first grade of elementary school and spent a lot of time training and competing every week. For example, when I was in the sixth grade of elementary school, I was guaranteed at least four trainings and one game a week. &quot;It&#39;s absolutely fine to balance studying and playing football in elementary school.&quot; But in junior high school, the academic pressure suddenly increased. Lian Yutong was still able to train three times a week in the first grade of junior high school. After entering the second grade of junior high school this year, he really couldn&#39;t find the time. He could only put all the training on two days on the weekend and twice a week, leaving no training for the five days in between. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After children enter the second grade of junior high school, they only sleep 6 hours a day on average. Time is too precious. Sometimes they have to rush to train and have to eat in the car.&quot; Lian Lian said, &quot;In junior high school, if you want to If you play football, you will delay your studies; if you want to study, you will not be able to play well. You cannot have both.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lian Lian said that Lian Yutong&#39;s school has a high school entrance examination admission rate of only over 40%, which means that This means that she must be in the upper reaches of her class rankings to have any hope of being admitted to high school. This year Lian Yutong spent two months away training and competing, and his academic performance showed a downward trend. This made Lian Lian worried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now their father and daughter have two choices: focus on studying or focus on playing football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lian Lian said that focusing on study is a stable choice. Children can enter college and find a stable job in the future. But Lian Yutong likes to play football, and her parents respect her hobby. &quot;She really loves football, otherwise we wouldn&#39;t have to worry so much.&quot; But focusing on football is gambling with the child&#39;s future. There are too many uncertain factors in football and the success rate is too low, so learning cannot be lost. So, they can only do both. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/e51f43f59c69232015bc7fd34005c8c8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/e51f43f59c69232015bc7fd34005c8c8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258170&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 11, Lian Yutong (second from right) watched the game video with his parents and sister at home in Shenzhen.

The reporter asked Wang Jianjun, vice chairman of the Suzhou Football Association and vice president of Suzhou Sports School, about this. His written answer is as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The phenomenon of &#39;retiring at the age of 12&#39; has not happened in Suzhou. The main reason is that when we select outstanding talents, we talk to the parents about their children&#39;s future. We will build A good platform allows parents to choose: 1. Help every child go to college, and focus on training, competition, and study. If you can&#39;t go to a professional club, you can find a respected job after graduation through college study. 2. Help particularly outstanding children enter the national team. 3. Can’t enter the national team but can be selected for the provincial team, represent the provincial team in the National Games and get the top three (Jiangsu Province has a policy that the top three in the National Games (can be placed in a job), and also solves the worries. 4. The requirement for coaches is not only to complete training and competition tasks, but more importantly, to cultivate each child to become a plastic talent with comprehensive development of morality, intelligence and physical fitness, so that every family Don’t worry. 5. At the high school stage, if children and parents are willing to go abroad to play football and study, we will also help them solve it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;So I think as long as the problem of children&#39;s future can be solved, there will be no problem.

Without this platform, Lian Yutong may not have the opportunity to participate in high-level national competitions. &quot;She has played a total of 12 11-a-side national matches so far, all of which are in key city groups this year.&quot; Lian Lian said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;青岛U13女足主教练于铭磊在球队战胜武汉队后说：“孩子的成长需要这样的高水平比赛。这样的比赛要多举行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使青训环境改善也不足以破除“12岁退役”现象。一位地方足球工作者无奈地说：“其实足协在这里办法不多，人家孩子去上学，你拦不住。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位教练说，家长需要孩子踢球未来有保障，“我们无法给他们保障，只能眼睁睁地看着一些很优秀的苗子离开了足球”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“12岁退役”导致大量足球人才流失，这一现象也并不仅限于12岁，只是在这一年龄段更为突出，有些孩子更早或稍晚放弃了足球。 &lt;span>;这是足球青训领域学训矛盾的反映，需要学训双管齐下解决。此现象不破，中国足球难兴。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[城市漫步丨洛城机密]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260542]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 12:05:41&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/gynCLkJT3JTZFvdKWSGUoMmLBVN4e1L8HuQkDoPc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;615&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/gynCLkJT3JTZFvdKWSGUoMmLBVN4e1L8HuQkDoPc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258153&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;洛杉矶市中心。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1974年，当德国著名导演沃纳·赫尔佐格（Werner Herzog）听闻影评人、恩师洛特·艾斯纳（Lotte Eisner）病危，他没有登上下一班飞机或火车，而是执意从慕尼黑徒步去往巴黎。那是暴风雪肆虐的冬天，这一程至少需要好几周的时间，然而赫尔佐格却坚信：“只要我用双脚走过去，她就一定能活下来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可以把赫尔佐格的行为看成是他私底下和命运之神打赌：如果我完成这一大胆的挑战，你必须兑现我的愿望。记录这段旅程的英译本《冰雪纪行》（Of Walking in Ice）在简介里把赫尔佐格的徒步之行称为“朝圣之旅”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也很喜欢长途漫步。然而，美国的城市很多是为汽车打造的，不适合步行。很多城市里都有类似的情况，从A地到B地看起来直线距离很近，但没有所谓的捷径，有的只是绕行的公路，十分钟的车程走路就要一个小时。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我仍选择走路，当然不是作为每天通勤的手段，而是周末“放空”的方式。在美国，或许除了东海岸的少数几座城市，大多数城市无法提供很好的“城市漫步”感受。但有时候我会反过来觉得，所谓良好的“城市漫步”体验是现代商业社会对消费者的规训。我们期待在地图上标出一个个重要的地标：街道提供“景致”，建筑提供“历史”，博物馆提供“浓缩的知识”，餐厅提供美食，咖啡店提供休憩，而后我们会逐个踩点，自以为对这个地方了然于胸。殊不知，我们不过在这些地方做着普通游客所做的事情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;真正的步行是把肉身暴露在荒芜面前。来美国的第一年在爱荷华，那是被大片玉米地包围的大学城，因为好奇，明明可以坐校车回来的路，我用走的，经过的其实就是漫天飞长的野草，偶尔经过几栋大方盒子状的体育馆和学校建筑，路上没有人，只有我和几只彩色羽翅的小鸟。鸟儿似乎也觉得我很奇怪，停在枝条上瞅了我半晌才姗姗飞走。大自然没有善恶这种简单的二分法，我几次目睹遭到野猫袭击后的鸟雀尸体，有时候是我误闯“犯罪现场”，我看到野猫半掩在草丛中，用凶恶的眼神看我，生怕我抢走它的猎物。还有一次，我在河边与一条正在“穿马路”的小蛇狭路相逢，我浑身的汗毛都竖起来了，到底是继续往前走还是退回去？我犹豫着，这时候，我才发现，小蛇可能也在怕我，它蜷曲起来，也在想到底是前进还是倒退。这种彼此的害怕反而消解了我的恐惧，很快，它窜进对面的草丛，我也继续往前走。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在城市里，尤其是美国的城市里，街道也颇有狂野自然的意味。开车的人可以把“荒芜”的时间压缩到最低限度，也可以用金属和车窗玻璃来建构自由和安全。步行则无法提供这种选项。在洛杉矶，虽然我从市中心回家有很便捷的公交和轻轨，但我还是常常花一个多小时走回来。城市的风貌会立即发生转变，前面还是高楼大厦以及沿街叫卖的墨西哥裔摊贩，隔一条马路就是绘满涂鸦的天桥以及衣衫褴褛、自言自语的流浪汉，因为走路，必须和他们擦身而过，鼻腔接受着尿骚臭的侵袭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我无意美化这种步行的行为，我这么做，一半是因为驾照仍没有考过，另一半则是幼年的习惯使然。不仅是洛杉矶，我在圣路易斯、底特律、芝加哥也是这样走，甚至走过几个需要稍加提防的街区。这样的行为在很多人看来无异于冒险，新闻上偶尔会有神志恍惚的流浪汉袭击路人的行为。但实际上，更多的是不适，而不是危险，倘若你像我一样，看起来就像个十足的穷人（只要看看我的手机和鞋子就没有行窃的欲望），而且总是走在光天化日之下的主路上（万一遭遇危机，可以往车道上寻求帮助）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也希望可以告诉你，我在这样的步行过程中收获了无数的故事，但事实远非如此，故事依靠更有目的的访谈、研究以及观察。我钟爱赫尔佐格的《冰雪纪行》也是因为他的坦诚，他写下了漫步时的荒芜以及或许毫无意义的遇见：“晦暗寂寥的森林包围了我，周遭一片死寂，只有风声在呼啸。西边的天空泛黄，空气很闷，像是要下冰雹了，高处的天空则是朦胧的灰黑色。忽然，眼前出现一座巨大的红色采石场：巨坑中积蓄着红色的水，一台挖土机停在水中，遍身生锈毫无用处。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但也不能说我一无所获。我在不同地方碰到的乞讨者打招呼的方式是不同的，底特律的乞讨者会夸耀你的衣着，芝加哥的乞讨者则会先给你施行一项帮助（有人帮我把行李箱直接拎下地铁站），洛杉矶的乞讨者会跟你诉苦。经历有限，对这些地域的观察不一定准确，然而底特律的朋友也告诉我，当地人非常重视时尚，连乞丐也会常常夸赞衣着，我忽然感到自己走在了这座城的真实场域之中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;追根究底，关于行走，每个人都有各自的理由。十九世纪的美国作家梭罗在新英格兰地区徒步是为了在星辰的高度呼吸这颗星球的空气，用双脚获取大地的知识。而赫尔佐格在漫步三周之久，抵达巴黎，洛特·艾斯纳竟然奇迹般地好转了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我则想起了儿时的一段往事。当时我可能才五六岁，父亲特别喜欢伏趴在床上，要我光着脚在他的脊背上乱踩，说这是世上最舒服的按摩。我听了也特别高兴，就很认真地在他的背上“行走”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这之后，我和父亲从未如此亲密过，我也和母亲一样，嫌弃他“不求上进”“不负责任”，甚至夏天还散发出汗臭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;或许，冥冥之中，只有在街道上乱走才让我感到和脚下的城市亲密无间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都崇州被狗咬伤女童已出院，身体各系统恢复顺利]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260555]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 11:12:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;11月14日，记者从四川大学华西医院了解到，成都崇州被狗咬伤女童经医院积极救治，已于11月13日出院。&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;目前肝肾功能正常，身体各系统恢复顺利，伤口愈合情况良好&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;，后续需根据医嘱定期复查。住院期间，四川大学华西医院人工缴费窗口收到预交金共计22万元，使用8万余元。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大V控诉综艺节目装修“翻车”：普通人装修要踩多少坑？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260540]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The master stood in front of the door, and several dazzling haloes of light shone on the metal round door, and then, The door slides open to one side, and the owner steps in. The lights above his head light up in sequence with the owner&#39;s steps. In the middle of the room, there is a square box. The electric door of the square box opens automatically, revealing a private space equipped with a large-screen TV and a bed. The owner can rest here, watch movies and play games without being disturbed. The lights in the room can change color according to the mood of the owner. Sometimes it is bright white, and sometimes it turns to warm orange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone who has ever dreamed of science fiction would want to own such a cool cyberpunk-style house. Well-known digital blogger Li Jieling is also one of them. Therefore, when he saw the designer&#39;s plan, he immediately decided to participate in the decoration variety show &quot;Miracle Renewal Home&quot; and spend more than one million to renovate his house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the design is beautiful, but it is not that easy to implement. Recently, Li Jieling posted on Weibo, complaining that the decoration was &quot;overturned&quot; and cost a huge amount of money, but it was far from achieving the results he expected. According to the articles, photos, videos and other information published by Li Jieling, as well as the contract he signed with the decorator, the electric door is 150,000 yuan, the lighting system is 185,000 yuan, and the black square device is 290,000 yuan, plus design fees, transportation and installation fees Waiting for miscellaneous charges, the total charge for these three major items is 730,000 yuan, plus the decoration in other places, the total cost exceeds one million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But after spending such a large amount of money, we did not get very good results: the electric door only has a simple sliding function, and the promised cool effect was not realized at all; the electric door of the square box opened the door, stretched out the chair, etc. There are also many problems with the structure. Firstly, the gaps are too large to form a complete whole, and the appearance is not beautiful enough. Secondly, the operation is very slow and the sound is loud; only the lighting system can pass the test. Due to the huge gap with psychological expectations, Li Jieling finally refused to take over the house and continue to record the program, and asked the decorator and program owner to make rectifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been many programs on new house decoration and old house renovation, which have attracted many viewers. Many people like to watch house building and decoration programs, hoping to provide some inspiration for their own decoration, or simply to see how other people&#39;s homes look like when decorated. But this is not the first time Li Jieling has &quot;overturned&quot; and caused complaints. The last time that the internet went viral was the &quot;Million Dollar Red Brick House&quot; on the show &quot;Dream Renovator&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old man Du from rural Gansu Province hoped that the program team would help him transform his old house into a modern, western-style and exquisite small foreign-style building. As a result, a designer from Beijing designed the house into a &quot;red brick rough house&quot;. There are exposed red bricks and cement everywhere, as well as hollow brick walls. This cost more than 1.32 million. As soon as the program aired, it aroused strong complaints from netizens. However, some people defended the designer, believing that the designer&#39;s work is actually compatible with the environmental style of the northwest countryside, has considerable artistic quality, and has no problem with practicality. Du Laobo and netizens find it difficult to accept it. In fact, it is influenced by traditional concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe the designer has his own ideas, and this work is also very &quot;modern&quot;. However, when designing, constructing, and decorating, we receive money and are entrusted by others. Shouldn&#39;t we respect the client&#39;s ideas first? ? At the beginning of the design, the designer should communicate with the client in detail about the requirements. Even if the designer has his own ideas, he should obtain the client&#39;s understanding and consent during communication. He should not completely follow his own ideas and &quot;open the blind box&quot; for the client after the construction is completed. At that time, the work was done, and making changes would be a major undertaking, if not impossible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the situation Li Jieling encountered was different from that of Mr. Du. In Li Jieling&#39;s case, there was no problem with the design. In fact, Li Jieling agreed to participate in the show only after she was satisfied with the designer&#39;s plan. But what I didn&#39;t expect is that the ideal is plump, but the reality is very skinny. When the cool design is implemented in reality, not only the effect is greatly reduced, but even the basic beauty is difficult to achieve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the decoration program, the effect was not satisfactory, which attracted the attention of netizens and could be corrected. For example, the house of Mr. Du in Gansu received strong criticism after the program was broadcast. The program team responded that the renovation would continue to be improved and the program team would bear half of the renovation costs. Judging from the follow-up program that was broadcast later, the results after the transformation were quite acceptable. As for the situation Li Jieling encountered this time, because Li Jieling himself is a big V and has a strong influence on social media, he has the capital to bargain with the decorator and the program team. The other party currently agrees to complete the renovation before the Spring Festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should ordinary people do if they encounter such a situation? In reality, house decoration is really a matter of luck. The decoration market is a mixed bag, and homeowners often have to work hard to achieve satisfactory decoration results. Disputes arising from decoration quality are endless. How do ordinary people avoid pitfalls when decorating? Even if you choose a regular decoration company, the decoration company may outsource the specific work to the decoration team; even if you sign a decoration contract with clear agreements on the decoration effect, construction period, etc., and there are breach of contract clauses, all kinds of wrangling will inevitably happen. Li Jieling&#39;s experience further reflects the many pitfalls faced by ordinary people in decoration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[儿童肺炎支原体高发，囤积阿奇霉素不可取]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260550]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 10:07:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[世界最大地下水漏斗补漏]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260534]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/13/cbcc4f6c12.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 13/cbcc4f6c12.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258118&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A deactivated shallow water in Zhangzhuang Village, Nanpi County, Cangzhou City, Hebei Province Weeds have grown over the well. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Linsong grinned, with two rows of yellow teeth clearly visible, &quot;Everyone knows which village we are from when we go out. The fluoride content in the groundwater is too high.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High concentrations of fluoride can damage the ameloblasts of the tooth germ, causing the enamel to turn yellow. Wujiafang Village is located in Wumaying Town, Nanpi County, Cangzhou City, Hebei Province. It entered the coverage of the East Route Project of South-to-North Water Diversion a few years ago. To drink &quot;Yangtze River water&quot;, the villagers no longer need to use yellow teeth as &quot;ID cards&quot;. A big lock is also hung on the deep machine well house in the village, which will only be used during the busy farming season. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In many Hebei villages, water from the Yellow River is used for farmland irrigation. The &quot;one reduction and one increase&quot; measure of reducing overexploitation of groundwater and increasing water supply through multiple channels is to control the groundwater funnel - a funnel-shaped concave surface formed by the large-scale exploitation of deep groundwater, the water level drops, and the surrounding groundwater flows toward the center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Groundwater funnels can cause ground subsidence, which can damage railways, buildings, underground pipelines, and even endanger embankment safety. Since the 1960s and 1970s, the &quot;Tianjin-Cangzhou-Hengshui-Dezhou Deep Composite Funnel&quot; has gradually connected into a piece, with the largest area in the world. According to an article published by Zhang Zhaoji and others from the Key Laboratory of Groundwater Science and Engineering of the Ministry of Natural Resources in 2022, the most serious plot in Cangzhou, located in the center of the funnel area, has sunk by a total of 2.5 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the Ministry of Water Resources and other four ministries and commissions issued the &quot;Action Plan for the Comprehensive Control of Groundwater Overexploitation in North China&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot; Action Plan&quot;&lt;/span>;), which proposed that by 2035, we will strive to fully achieve a balance of groundwater extraction and replenishment, and gradually fill the deficit of over-exploitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, the Ministry of Water Resources announced at a press conference that through nearly five years of governance, the trend of year-by-year decline in groundwater levels has been fundamentally reversed, and the short-term goals of the &quot;Action Plan&quot; have been exceeded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in July 2023, Hebei Province’s 2022 annual audit work report (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the audit report&lt;/span>;) warned : 11 cities and 16 counties have problems such as water abstraction without a license, water abstraction exceeding the license, and slow progress in shutting down water intake wells; 6 cities and 2 counties have problems such as unfinished consumption of river water, and arrears of 3.175 billion yuan in South-to-North Water Diversion fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hebei’s agricultural water accounts for 55%, of which about 70% is used to irrigate winter wheat. Managing winter wheat irrigation well is the key to suppressing groundwater exploitation. Now is the season for winter wheat to be irrigated with overwintering water. Southern Weekend reporters found in interviews that Hebei Province has strictly controlled new wells, shut down old wells, and actively transferred water in recent years. Behind the problems reported in the audit are difficulties in water intake supervision, lagging small water conservancy projects, and water shortages. Problems such as the backward payment system. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Strictly control new wells&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wells are the connection between people and groundwater, but in Hebei, it is difficult to drill new wells. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;my country implements a water abstraction licensing system, and drilling wells requires approval. In 2017, Hebei designated prohibited/restricted mining areas. No new water wells are allowed to be dug in the prohibited mining areas, and hierarchical approval is required in the restricted mining areas. In 2018, the &quot;Hebei Province Water Drawing License Management Measures&quot; was revised to transfer the approval authority for groundwater drawing licenses to the provincial level. In 2022, the restricted mining area will increase by more than 36,000 square kilometers, equivalent to 2.5 times the area of ​​Cangzhou City. Hebei also stipulates that when digging new wells in restricted mining areas, &quot;1 minus 2&quot; must be used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the purpose of drilling a well is only for personal use, the policy still leaves a loophole. The &quot;Hebei Province Water Drawing Permit Management Measures&quot; stipulates that units or individuals who draw small amounts of water for household purposes and scattered free-range or captive livestock and poultry for drinking are exempt from applying for a water drawing permit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand this category? When Southern Weekend reporters inquired about drilling wells in a personal capacity, Peng Ping, a staff member of the water resources department of a water conservancy department in Hebei Province, explained that there are two main requirements: first, the wells should only be used for personal use and not for business purposes; second, do not drill. It&#39;s too deep, &quot;even if it&#39;s twenty or thirty meters away,&quot; it cannot touch the deep water layer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep water generally refers to the water below the aquiclude layer, which is a rock formation with extremely weak water permeability. Shallow groundwater can be replenished through surface water systems, but deep groundwater is generally buried more than 50 meters deep and replenishes slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to dig a deep water well, &quot;you need the approval of the county government, and then report it to the city and provincial governments in turn.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters checked the water license approval ledger regularly published by the Hebei Provincial Department of Water Resources and found that 50 or 60 companies were approved within two days, and the vast majority were companies, factories, schools and other legal entities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under heavy pressure, some people still take risks. The audit report reported that there is a problem of unlicensed water abstraction in some areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late September, Southern Weekend reporters consulted more than a dozen well-drilling teams in the Cangzhou area and surrounding areas about drilling wells. A well-drilling worker in Langfang claimed that he was providing water to some chemical plants in Langfang that did not have water extraction licenses. Drilled a well. Another well-drilling worker in Tianjin also said that when he digs wells for customers, he does not ask them to show their water permission. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Closing old wells&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to strictly controlling new wells, Hebei has also begun to close or reduce water production for old wells. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wangjiakou Village, Chenzui Township, Qingxian County, Cangzhou, Southern Weekend reporters found a locked red brick well house with an area of ​​more than ten square meters. A shiny sign was nailed to the outer wall: Shut down the well. Private activation is strictly prohibited. Through the holes in the iron door, one can see the electricity meter and gate on the brick wall, as well as the wellhead where the pump is installed on the ground. The wires have accumulated a thick layer of dust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/f9b8547100.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/f9b8547100.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258119&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In late September 2023, the door of a deep motor-shaft well house in Wangjiakou Village was locked, and the scene inside the room could still be seen through the small hole in the door. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the vast farmland outside the well house, there is a red iron &quot;fire hydrant&quot; every other section of the road - this was once the outlet of underground pipes, which transported deep well water It was transported from the well house to the field and is now abandoned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Hebei Daily&quot; report, as of the end of August 2022, more than 230,000 water wells have been shut down in the province, including urban domestic and industrial water wells and rural domestic water wells in the South-to-North Water Diversion receiving areas. According to the 2023 Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Work Conference, by the end of 2022, the comprehensive management tasks of 5.97 billion cubic meters of groundwater overexploitation in Hebei Province have been completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a county in southern Cangzhou, a staff member of the agricultural department told Southern Weekend reporters that there were originally more than 9,000 wells in the county, but now the deep wells have been sealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even so, the audit report still pointed out that the closure of water wells has been slow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Hebei Province Groundwater Management Regulations&quot;, in the deep groundwater funnel area, agricultural irrigation wells that draw deep groundwater must also be shut down as planned. However, Southern Weekend reporters saw that there are still many villages that rely on deep water wells, and the closure period is unknown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of September, Wu Linsong was watering the bottom moisture needed before sowing winter wheat. Southern Weekend reporters saw that sections of yellow plastic floor cages were assembled into a long pipe of tens of meters. One end was connected to a red faucet at the edge of the field, and the other end was flowing with clear groundwater. Wu Linsong adjusts the position of the water outlet from time to time to irrigate along the diagonal line of the field. More than 70 kilometers away, Jinliuzhuang Village, Qingzhou Town, Qing County, Cangzhou City, is also using deep machine-driven wells for irrigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a3ca232ea3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a3ca232ea3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258120&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Linsong’s fields are still irrigated with groundwater. To do this, he needed to lay dozens of meters of yellow ground cages and constantly move heavy pipes. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Peng Ping explained that deep machine wells are currently closed seasonally. If there is water in the river that can be used when farming, you cannot use the water from the well. Otherwise, you can use the water from the well. &quot;There will be no hard shutdown.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those water wells dug illegally, their concealment makes supervision more difficult. Excluding the house and electricity meter, the above-ground construction part of the deepwater well is not large, and the height of the pump is less than knee-high. Shallow wells are even more inconspicuous, with their mouths not as wide as city manhole covers and only ankle-high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of a water conservancy bureau in a county in Hebei Province said that the grassroots water conservancy department is limited by establishment and does not have sufficient manpower. Sometimes there are only about 40 people in the water affairs bureau at the county level, and only a small part of them are involved in water administrative law enforcement. They can only go to the fields from time to time to inspect the sealing and water withdrawal status of wells, and whether there is a water withdrawal permit. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Insufficient capillaries and difficulty in digestion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In farmers’ perception, warm river water is more suitable for irrigating fields than cold groundwater. For example, Wang Gui, a villager in Wangjiakou Village, Qingxian County, feels that the corn cobs produced this year are indeed longer than last year. However, Wang Gui couldn&#39;t tell whether it was because water from the Yellow River had been diverted into the dry river in recent years or because of increased precipitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a07e37bd49.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a07e37bd49.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258121&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In Hebei, a drought-ridden country with little rainfall, the amount of watering directly affects crop growth. The corn field on the left side of the sweet potato field is irrigated normally and is growing well; the corn field on the right side is stunted because the owner of the field goes out to work and relies on the sky for water. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Hebei Province Water Resources Bulletin&quot; shows that in 2022, Hebei Province&#39;s cross-basin water diversion volume reached 4.128 billion cubic meters, accounting for 22.6% of the total water supply. According to Southern Weekend reporters, in rural Hebei, the &quot;Yangtze River water&quot; from the South-to-North Water Diversion mainly replaces domestic water, while most of the river water extracted for irrigation is diverted from the Yellow River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most farmers are in favor of closing wells if they can use nearly free river water for irrigation. The China Rural Research Institute of Tsinghua University once surveyed 270 farmers in Hengshui, Hebei Province, on their evaluation of groundwater overexploitation control measures. For the measures of filling and sealing wells, the farmers&#39; favorable rate was only 61%; but for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project and the Yellow River Water Diversion, the favorable rate was only 61%. As high as 91% and 95% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cost of diverting water from the Yellow River is lower than that from the Yangtze River, only a few cents per cubic meter at the end of the field. A staff member of the agricultural department of a county in Cangzhou also told Southern Weekend reporters that the county government will transfer water unplanned for irrigation in 2024. This transaction was led by the water conservancy department and paid by the county finance, costing millions of yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters found in interviews that many villages still cannot use external water for irrigation. The main reason is the lack of water conservancy facilities to divert water to the fields, even if the river is just a few kilometers away from the village. The terrain of some villages is one or two meters higher than the surrounding areas, and water from the surrounding water systems cannot be diverted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/69b364a145.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/69b364a145.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258122&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the fields of Wangjiakou Village, the corn has just been harvested, leaving a bare land waiting for wheat to be sown. A red cast iron faucet stands on its own, connected to the deep shaft not far away. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Qing, a groundwater research expert at an institute affiliated to the Ministry of Water Resources, explained that Hebei’s rural areas are vast and there are no ready-made urban water conservancy facilities like Beijing and Tianjin. Han Qing compared rivers, ditches and ponds in rural areas to &quot;capillaries&quot; in the last mile. &quot;When external water is transferred to some areas with flat or high terrain, supporting pipe network projects must be provided to supply it. Provincial and county governments must Everyone has to invest, and it won’t be possible for several years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cost of building rural water conservancy projects is not small. Public information shows that in Qing County, Cangzhou alone, nearly 100 million yuan will be invested in water conservancy projects related to the comprehensive management of groundwater overexploitation in 2023, including channel dredging, reconstruction of water culverts, and new control valves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Finances at all levels are very difficult now, and it would be good to be able to pay wages.&quot; Du Yun, head of the water affairs department of a county in Hebei Province, said, &quot;There is really no way to complete all the water diversion projects at once. We can only Do our best to improve.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For farmers who cannot use water from the Yellow River, can they use the &quot;Yangtze River water&quot; from the South-to-North Water Diversion in their home tap pipes for irrigation? This alternative would be prohibitively expensive and currently not a possibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Jiansheng, former director of the Institute of Hydrogeology and Environmental Geology of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, told Southern Weekend reporters that the fundamental reason why some areas still rely on groundwater is that the cost of replacement surface water sources is too high. &quot;According to current cost calculations, the cost of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project to reach the irrigation plots in the central and eastern Hebei Plain is as high as 5-6 yuan per cubic meter. The cost of water use is impossible to bear unless the government provides high water source replacement subsidies.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The cost of water from the South-to-North Water Diversion Project is much higher than that of water diversion from the Yellow River, and local governments are not active in consuming it. A report from the Audit Office shows that 6 cities and 2 counties have unfinished tasks of absorbing river water and are in arrears with water fees of 3.175 billion yuan for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Accurate measurement, say goodbye to flood irrigation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Whether it is groundwater or external water transfer, many experts believe that moderate charging of water fees can cultivate farmers&#39; awareness of water conservation and can also provide support for construction and maintenance. Provide funding for rural water conservancy projects. However, water fee pricing needs to be cautious to ensure food security, take into account farmers&#39; affordability, and not increase agricultural production costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiang Wenlai, a researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Resources and Agricultural Zoning of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said, &quot;Agricultural water prices are higher based on full cost, which is difficult for farmers to accept. Even if they are charged based on maintenance costs, they still face difficulties. This cost The burden should be reasonably shared by the state, local governments and farmers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Without accurate measurement, there is no rigorous water price system. Water charges for urban residents generally include water resources charges, water company costs and sewage treatment charges, which are measured through water meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most farmers in Hebei still have unclear accounts of their irrigation water consumption. For the use of groundwater, it is common to convert electricity bills into water bills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/bdadd4bd45.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/bdadd4bd45.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258123&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In a well house in a village, villagers take the meter counts of their own water usage to settle their electricity bills. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are seven or eight deep machine-operated wells in Wujiafang Village, and Wu Shucai is the manager of two of them. Villagers called him when they wanted to irrigate, and he went to the telephone pole outside the well house and wrote down the numbers on the electric meter. The old and new figures are subtracted to determine the villagers&#39; electricity consumption, which is then converted into electricity bills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the basis of normal electricity prices, some villages will &quot;increase the price&quot; to subsidize the personnel who manage the wells. Southern Weekend reporters found in interviews that the electricity charges for water wells in each village are different, ranging from 0.31 to 1 yuan per kilowatt hour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using groundwater requires paying electricity bills, while using surface water is almost free. Villagers don’t even know whether the water they use comes from thousands of miles away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Gui did some calculations and found out that irrigating the ground with well water is billed according to the electricity consumption of deep wells. The price of electricity per kilowatt hour is 1-1.5 yuan. The water cost for growing one acre of wheat is It costs more than one hundred yuan. He spent more than 1,000 yuan to buy a diesel pump. The cost of pumping water from the river was only about 2 yuan in gas money, which was almost negligible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/d3c25b3f0b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/d3c25b3f0b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258124&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;With the diesel pump, Wang Gui pumps water from the river for irrigation at almost free cost. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some rural areas have begun to try metering. Water meters are installed on the water wells in Nansong Village, Lugongbao Town, Renqiu City, and the water conservancy department can remotely monitor whether anyone is secretly taking water. The village party secretary of Nansong Village told Southern Weekend reporters that during severe droughts, the villagers can apply to the water conservancy department for temporary use of motorized wells. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Peng Ping’s view, establishing an accurate metering system will help the water conservancy department grasp more accurate water consumption. &quot;In the past, it was all estimated. For example, 50 cubic meters of water was used to water one acre of land, and then the estimate was based on the area of ​​cultivated land. But if it had just rained, you might have only poured 40 cubic meters of water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Shi Jianshe reminded that the installation of metering devices was based on Beijing’s experience, and the long-term effects may not be ideal. “Wellhead metering measures require large investments and are difficult to maintain. If farmers do not understand them, they will cause a lot of damage.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Beijing announced that it would implement metering and charging for 30,000 agricultural wells in the city within three years. In June 2023, the Beijing Municipal Water Affairs Bureau held an open tender for &quot;Construction of Agricultural and Rural Water Use Control and Standardized Management Models for Different Purposes&quot;. The purpose was to solve the problems of vulnerable, broken, stolen and inaccurate measurement of agricultural water metering facilities. Supplement and improve agricultural water use statistics and improve the level of agricultural irrigation water supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Jianshi suggested that the implementation of accurate wellhead metering can overcome the idea of ​​flood irrigation, and should be gradually promoted on the basis of the stable operation of the pilot, such as reasonable water use with subsidies and no charges, special water use with moderate charges, and wasteful use of water. High charges for sexual water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/14b3e5248a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/14b3e5248a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258125&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At the China Agricultural University Experimental Station in Wuqiao County, Cangzhou City, Hebei Province, Professor Wang Zhimin began researching water-saving agriculture in the 1980s. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past three years, Han Qing has been paying attention to groundwater levels in Hebei. After analyzing the data from thousands of observation sites, he gave an extremely positive evaluation: &quot;The mining volume has decreased significantly, and the deep water has basically shown a rebound trend. Due to the hysteresis of land subsidence, the subsidence has not stopped, but the degree is also gradually increasing. Reduced. Generally speaking, the management of groundwater overexploitation areas is moving in a good direction.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shijian Province reminds that after the balance of groundwater extraction and replenishment is achieved in the future, groundwater will not be unusable at all, and the water level will be restored. It may lead to secondary salinization, urban underground engineering immersion and other problems. It is necessary to reasonably and appropriately arrange the extraction and utilization of groundwater according to the needs of suitable water level control to maintain the optimal groundwater level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Wu Linsong, Wang Gui, Peng Ping, Han Qing, and Du Yun are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
