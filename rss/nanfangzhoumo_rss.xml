In terms of net profit alone, the four major state-owned banks have surpassed their international peers: the total in the first half of 2023 exceeded 603.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than twenty years ago, the four major banks fell into &quot;technical bankruptcy.&quot; After China&#39;s accession to the WTO, the country&#39;s door opened wide, and foreign banks entered China frequently, and since 2006 they have enjoyed national treatment. Observers and the industry have been crying wolf for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, China Construction Bank and Bank of China were designated by the State Council as pilot projects for the shareholding reform of wholly state-owned banks, and were expected to &quot;transform into internationally competitive modern joint-stock commercial banks in about three years.&quot; After unprecedented financial restructuring and the introduction of international strategic investment, China Construction Bank and Bank of China were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2005 and 2006, respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This move has clarified a replicable path for the shareholding reform and listing of ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank of China. As Jiang Jianqing, the then chairman of ICBC, said, the joint-stock reform is a glorious prelude to the reform of my country&#39;s state-owned banks. It is also a desperate battle with no retreat and a reform that cannot afford to lose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the glorious prologue, strengthening corporate governance is an important task. Under layer upon layer supervision, the four major industries are moving inwards and innovating continuously. A clean financial statement trusted by global investors is an example of 20 years of practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, and Ernst &amp; Young are the four internationally renowned accounting firms (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot;). Among them, Deloitte China Vice Chairman Wu Weijun has served as the Bank of China and China Postal Savings The signing accountant for the stock reform and listing of banks. The former is the pilot stock reform and listing of China&#39;s state-owned banks, and the latter is the final project of the stock reform and listing of China&#39;s state-owned banks. He is praised by the financial industry for participating in and leading the design of a &quot;bank reform roadmap&quot; suitable for China&#39;s national conditions, and providing technical guidance for promoting the reform of the four major state-owned commercial banks in the three areas of corporate governance, financial reporting and capital restructuring. He is also known as the accountant most familiar with China&#39;s state-owned banks, as he has served as the signing accountant for Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank of China. Today, he has served as the signing accountant for the annual report of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for three consecutive years. As early as more than 20 years ago, he served as a partner of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, actively promoted the implementation of the localization transformation plan of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, and has been committed to playing the role of auditors as &quot;gatekeepers&quot; in the capital market. &quot; value and have a &quot;capital eye&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a fellow traveler in the great era of China&#39;s banking reform and opening up, on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of China&#39;s financial reform and opening up, Wu Weijun repeatedly emphasized in an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend that the reform of China&#39;s four major state-owned commercial banks is a The results and historical significance of the arduous reform despite all difficulties are also remarkable. Today, the world is facing major changes unseen in a century, and China&#39;s financial industry will face huge historical challenges. At this important moment in the deepening and development of international and domestic finance, the presence of Chinese financial entrepreneurs is crucial. They will lead Chinese financial companies to shift from expanding externally to strengthening connotation with high quality. He personally is willing to continue to serve the development of the country&#39;s financial industry professionally. “It is the most glorious thing in my profession that the accounting statements I sign can be recognized by the international capital market and international supervision.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Weijun particularly emphasized the internationalization of talents. &quot;I suggest that Chinese enterprises comprehensively review the existing international talent training system and build an advanced international talent competency model. Without talents with international vision and international standards, it will be difficult to consolidate the results of 45 years of reform and opening up, and it will be difficult to Become an effective participant in the international capital market and international financial industry.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/9TrwL1UXbKQdly518gBthsTEVJlaP6YexFRnaiaH. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;596&quot; height=&quot;894&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/9TrwL1UXbKQdly518gBthsTEVJlaP6YexFRnaiaH.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;256118&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Weijun: Vice Chairman of Deloitte China and one of the first Chinese partners of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms.

He was not only the first Chinese partner of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, but also the first to obtain the British Chartered Certified Accountant after 1949. Qualified Mainland Chinese. During his more than 30-year career, he has worked in mainland China, Hong Kong, New York, London and Sydney, and has participated in, promoted and witnessed many historic transformational events in the financial and accounting fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 1993 to 1994, he assisted American expert Tom Macy in serving the People’s Bank of China’s Financial System Prudential Supervision Reform Consulting Project, introducing the most basic risks into the risk management of commercial banks. Evaluation method - five-level classification of loans, and establish an accounting system for the Chinese banking industry that can be basically understood and accepted by international organizations and global peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When assessing the historical value and even the impact of these two events on today, he said, &quot;The impact of these two events cannot be overemphasized. The accounting system of commercial banks is in line with international standards and has provided international Investors and counterparties recognize our banks, and the Basel banking regulatory system accepts our banks, creating conditions for state-owned commercial banks to establish accounting controls, risk management and modern corporate governance systems. The five-level loan classification not only provides banks with It provides basic risk management tools, helps maintain asset quality, and also provides regulatory agencies with a supervisory grip on financial stability. This is the institutional foundation for modern financial development. It is important to realize that the institutional construction for the development of China&#39;s modern financial industry is only 30 years old. In two years, we still have a lot to learn and improve.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, he experienced an unforgettable memory in his career - participating in and leading the design of the &quot;Bank Reform Roadmap.&quot; He commented on this, &quot;The reform of China&#39;s four major state-owned commercial banks is an arduous reform that overcomes all difficulties. But its results and historical significance are significant.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why can the reform persist and advance rapidly? Wu Weijun said, &quot;Supporting such a difficult banking reform to move forward is the determination of the central government&#39;s top management, as well as the professionalism and courage of the leaders at the executive level. At that time, I was the only one in the leadership team of the audit team who grew up in mainland China. . I very much want to carry out the reform of China’s banking industry and bring China’s state-owned banks into the ranks of the international banking industry. If the accounting statements I sign can be recognized by the international capital market and international supervision, it will be a great achievement in my major. The most glorious thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also participated in the formulation and implementation of the localization transformation plan of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms from 2010 to 2012. &quot;I value the inheritance of professionalism. Professionalism has two supporting points, one is moral integrity, and the other is professional service to the country, because the premise of professionalism is patriotism. Professionalism is the foundation of professionals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that in financial companies, the work of external auditors has special characteristics, that is, high-quality external audits are not only needed to protect the rights and interests of shareholders, but also to meet the regulatory compliance needs of domestic and foreign banks, and are also global financial and commodity trading counterparties. needs for party exposure risk management. The total on-balance sheet assets of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, where he serves as the signing accountant, exceed 40 trillion yuan. He told the team that they must make professional efforts to help ICBC increase its return on assets, even if it is only one ten thousandth. One ten thousandth of 40 trillion yuan in assets is 4 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only serving the banking industry, in important overseas capital markets, the &quot;Big Four&quot; members generally serve more than 70% of the listed companies. At present, China&#39;s capital market has become the second largest market in the world, but as of the end of October 2023, there were about 5,300 A-share listed companies, of which the number of companies with audit reports issued by the &quot;Big Four&quot; Chinese member firms only accounted for about 7%. Faced with such a gap, Wu Weijun believes that there is still much room for improvement in being a &quot;capital eye&quot;, which mainly includes clarifying the relationship between financial information preparers, auditors and regulators in the financial reporting chain and consolidating responsibilities; using large Data analysis and other technological means can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of audits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is generally believed that audit reports signed by the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, including Deloitte, are a passport to the international capital market. With it, the price of international financing for enterprises can be maintained at a more reasonable level. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“&lt;strong>;Without international talents, it is difficult to achieve&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;international integration of capital chains”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt; /strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said that when professional service organizations first entered China, they helped attract foreign investment. Later, their services focused on supporting the reform of Chinese enterprises and their entry into international capital. market. May I ask, what was the biggest difficulty in attracting foreign investment into China in the 1990s? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1978, China began to implement the policy of reform and opening up. In the early 1990s, China&#39;s economic system reform entered a new stage of transformation, starting from a &quot;planned economy as the mainstay, market regulation as a supplement&quot; to a &quot;socialist market economy&quot; system. In 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed the establishment of a socialist market economic system, and China&#39;s economic system began to undergo profound changes. How can international investors have enough confidence to enter China and understand China? The biggest difficulty in attracting foreign investment at that time was how to convince international investors that the Chinese government could truly embrace the market economy, follow international rules, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors during the transition from a planned economy to a market economy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During the state-owned bank reform period that began in 2003, state-owned What are the difficulties for commercial banks to attract foreign capital to invest in Chinese state-owned banks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2002, I served in the restructuring and share reform and listing of Bank of China Hong Kong. This project made me realize that the real stage for China’s financial system reform is in the mainland. After returning to Beijing, I served on the reform of the Bank of China. In 2005, Bank of China successively introduced international strategic investors—Royal Bank of Scotland, Temasek, UBS Group, and Asian Development Bank. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When state-owned commercial banks introduced international strategic investors in the early 21st century, the main focus of negotiations between China and foreign parties included the following aspects: first, whether they had consolidated their balance sheets; second, whether they had The ability to establish a corporate governance mechanism and operate it in accordance with the board of directors&#39; charter and rules of procedure; third, whether the risk management mechanism is effective in the long term. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Foreign capital entering China is attracted not only by the size of the Chinese economy and the market opportunities brought by its high growth, but also by its diligent and studious workers and its management that is willing to abide by international rules and cooperate with the international community. By. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The foundation of financial cooperation lies in the &quot;ability&quot; and &quot;willingness&quot; of the counterparty. For example, if you borrow money from someone else, what the person who lends you money cares most about is your ability to repay it? Are you willing to pay it back? Therefore, we cannot damage or lose the goodwill that has been established in the international capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Judging from the foreign-funded companies you have contacted, they are now investing in China What to expect from the environment? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Foreign capital enters China because they can make money in China. The basis for making money is not the absence of risks, but an understanding of risks and predictable returns. Only when the government&#39;s rules are transparent and things are done according to rules can capital flow more effectively. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The focus of the &quot;Big Four&quot; services in China is Support Chinese enterprises in reforming and entering international capital markets. Compared with more than 20 years ago, what new phenomena are emerging for Chinese companies going global now? What advice do you have for companies with a “going global” strategy? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We should not only discuss the &quot;going out&quot; of Chinese enterprises, but also expand to the international integration and international integration of Chinese enterprises. . Talent is always the foundation of development strategy and the source of core competitiveness. Without international talents, it would be difficult for Chinese companies to &quot;go global&quot; and enter the international capital market, let alone the international integration of supply chains and the international integration of capital chains. I suggest that Chinese companies comprehensively examine the existing international talent training system, build an advanced international talent competency model, explore more effective talent training models in the digital economy era and the post-epidemic era, and let the international capital market better see that it is What kind of people are managing Chinese companies now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China have opened operating institutions and outlets in more than 50 overseas countries and regions. They provide financial support for the integration of Chinese enterprises into the world economy. The overseas financial licenses and network resources of Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China are important assets accumulated from the reform of China&#39;s financial industry. In the current international geopolitical environment, it is almost impossible for Chinese financial institutions to obtain financial licenses in important overseas financial center cities. Therefore, the overseas license assets and network resources of Chinese financial institutions must be particularly cherished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;my country’s financial institutions must send their best talents to overseas financial center cities for experience, accumulate experience in collaboration with international regulatory agencies, establish communication channels, and form an echelon of international financial talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Be on thin ice&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As early as 1993 to 1994, you assisted American expert Tom Macy in serving the People’s Bank of China’s financial system prudential supervision reform project. 30 years ago, where was the gap between the supervision of China&#39;s financial industry and that of the international market? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Thirty years ago, the gap between China’s financial industry supervision and its international counterparts was mainly due to the lack of professionalism in supervision. It was not until the establishment of the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, that is, in 2003, that China formed a specialized regulatory agency and regulatory team. In 1993, there was no technical basis for dialogue between China’s financial regulators and international peers. Therefore, we assisted the People’s Bank of China in designing an accounting subject system and introducing the most basic risk assessment method—five-level loan classification. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the general direction of China&#39;s financial industry reform was marketization and internationalization. Both regulators and regulated persons had the enthusiasm and initiative to actively learn from foreign experience. This is the starting point for an international dialogue. Professional service organizations, such as Deloitte, mainly serve as a bridge for dialogue and communication between Chinese regulatory agencies, financial companies and international organizations. When China&#39;s financial institutions were reformed and listed, we played the role of &quot;marrying daughters&quot; and carrying the sedan chair. The gap is not terrible. The terrible thing is that there are no people on both sides of the gap who are willing to take a step forward. In the financial industry, we still don’t have the capital to be proud of. We must have an attitude of walking on thin ice. In the financial battlefield, it is never your competitors who defeat you. This is called professionalism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past 20 years, the financial regulatory system has undergone many changes. The China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission were born out of the People&#39;s Bank of China and were established simultaneously in 2003. Later, they were merged into the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission in 2018 until the State Administration of Financial Supervision was listed in 2023. Do you think there is room for change compared to the international regulatory regime? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For China’s financial industry, 2023 is an extraordinary year. China&#39;s financial regulatory system has been transformed into &quot;one committee, one bank, one bureau and one meeting.&quot; No matter how the organization is set up, there is only one room for change, and that is to improve professionalism. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of improving China&#39;s regulatory level in the past 20 years, I have put forward my professional opinions in three areas and had a positive impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first point of view is to strengthen the &quot;iron triangle&quot; relationship of financial supervision. This point of view was raised in 2009 after I returned from my secondment at the UK Financial Regulatory Authority. Under the financial regulatory framework, the &quot;iron triangle&quot; relationship refers to the tripartite relationship between the financial regulatory authorities, the central bank and the Ministry of Finance. The financial crisis tests a country&#39;s financial emergency and leadership capabilities. Improving the coordination capabilities of the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; relationship and responding quickly and effectively to crises plays an important role. Solving the problems of the financial system requires more than one government agency alone. Even in normal economic times, the three agencies need to coordinate to provide clear and non-duplicate guidance to the financial system. In terms of unified leadership of the financial system, the coordination and execution capabilities of this &quot;iron triangle&quot; need to continue to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of the Central Financial Working Committee is a need for modern economic and financial management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second point of view is to establish a regulatory tripartite negotiation mechanism. This view was raised when I, as a representative of an accounting firm, communicated with the then leaders of the China Banking Regulatory Commission after the establishment of the China Banking Regulatory Commission in March 2003. At that time, I proposed that we should learn from advanced international practices and that the regulatory authorities organize tripartite meetings every year for regulated financial institutions and their external auditors to discuss financial and business risk issues of regulatory concern and arrange regulatory work. Sometimes, closed meetings can even be arranged, where the regulator and the external auditor communicate on important and material issues without the presence of the regulated institution&#39;s management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third point of view is to supervise the shareholders of financial institutions. This was raised seriously by me at a seminar held in Xianghe, Hebei Province in 2005 to prepare for the listing of Bank of China. The bank&#39;s capital adequacy ratio requirement is 8%, which means the bank uses a leverage ratio of 12.5 times. If shareholders are not monitored, banks may be exposed to bad shareholder behavior. Discussion of the proposed regulation of shareholders also extends to Huijin&#39;s management model. I firmly express my support for Huijin’s model and promote Huijin to become a professional management organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, these views of mine can stand the test of time. I believe that some of the views I expressed today will prove to be important 30 years later and will appear on my transcript of professional service to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the structure of my country&#39;s financial regulatory system has been significantly adjusted and optimized. Under the existing regulatory framework, how to improve the effectiveness of the regulatory system and operating mechanisms? In terms of operational effectiveness, the following three articles must be completed in particular: first, how to attract and retain the best financial talents to join the financial supervision team; second, how to coordinate supervision between the central bank, the State Administration of Financial Supervision, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and other regulatory authorities Collaboration, how to respect the Ministry of Finance’s status as the last savior, how to give full play to the shareholder supervision role of the Financial SASAC (currently undertaken by Huijin and the Financial Department of the Ministry of Finance); third, how to develop and apply more powerful regulatory technology tools to enhance Supervision quality and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You suggest attracting and retaining the best financial talents to join the regulatory team. In the civil service sector, how to achieve breakthroughs and attract outstanding talents at market prices? Is there anything that foreign financial regulatory agencies can learn from? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Financial supervision and fiscal management and other institutions must respect professionalism. They function and are professionally based. We must trust experts and not doubt the patriotism possessed by professionals. Technical talents must be protected and supported in the civil service system. In the British and American financial regulatory systems, only high-level people, such as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, are listed in the civil service system. All other professionals are paid according to market prices. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have said before that the financial industry needs to strengthen supervision . In fact, the financial industry has been tightening regulations. How do you view the relationship between strong supervision and reform and innovation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Strong supervision and reform and innovation are not contradictory and cannot be neglected. Only by strengthening supervision can we prevent and resolve systemic financial risks; only by reform and innovation can we enhance the diversity of financial products and services, enhance the breadth and depth of the financial market, and better meet the financial needs of the people and the real economy. Smart financial entrepreneurs believe that supporting the real economy is supporting the future of the financial industry. The strengthening and bonding of the relationship between the real economy and the financial industry requires financial innovation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strong supervision and reform and innovation are &quot;both necessary&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot;. The key is to balance the relationship between supervision and innovation and grasp the intensity and boundaries of supervision. In short, regulation must be neither insufficient nor excessive. Excessive regulation will hinder reform and innovation for sustainable financial development. Of course, reform and innovation cannot be at the expense of significantly increasing systemic financial risks, and financial behaviors that are divorced from the real economy cannot be condoned. &quot;Idling&quot; financial innovation that is divorced from the real economy and within the financial link is &quot;pseudo-innovation&quot; for the purpose of financial profit-seeking, and must be stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“ &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Respect for professionalism is &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;bank reform &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;guarantee of courage in the face of danger &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The regulatory system is constantly changing, and banks are also constantly changing. You have participated in and led the design of the &quot;Bank Reform Roadmap&quot; that suits China&#39;s national conditions.

Where did your courage come from to design a &quot;reform roadmap&quot; and participate in bank reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Before the reform, China’s four major state-owned commercial banks were “technically bankrupt” and relied only on implicit state financial guarantees. to make ends meet. If there is no shareholding reform, the four major state-owned commercial banks will go from &quot;technical bankruptcy&quot; to actual bankruptcy. This was an urgent problem that needed to be solved in China&#39;s economic system reform at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We dare to design a reform roadmap for the four major state-owned commercial banks that are &quot;technically bankrupt&quot; because we have seen the country&#39;s reform courage and determination to overcome all difficulties; We are confident in our own professional abilities and have the ability to operate on the problems faced by financial institutions; this is because the management of financial institutions are responsible and dare to take responsibility, and can carry out the task list we have listed. In 2003, after completing the audit of Bank of China, we put forward more than 500 management suggestions. The leaders of Bank of China specifically instructed the internal audit department to set up a working group to supervise the implementation of the suggestions we made. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 2003 to 2006, you served as the signing accountant to assist the Bank of China Listed in both Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Do you have confidence in the major state-owned banks to further deepen reforms? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have always been confident in the reform and development of major state-owned banks. The basis of this confidence is recognition of financial reform policymakers and leaders, including recognition of the policy directions they have formulated. The leaders of financial institutions realized that failure to reform would lead to a dead end. They used their own knowledge reserves and were willing to cooperate with domestic and foreign experts to find a way out for reform. It was they who proposed, &quot;We need a road map.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial reform policymakers and leaders at that time adhered to the direction of marketization and internationalization, respected professionals, trusted and gave full play to the power of domestic and foreign experts. The major state-owned banks have completed the work tasks in the reform stage. The current challenge is to continue to improve their core competitiveness and adapt to the new environment, new changes, and new trends more efficiently. The leaders of major state-owned banks we have dealt with are professional. In any era, we need to respect professionalism. Respecting professionalism is the source of confidence and the guarantee of courage in the face of danger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to assisting Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank of China in their share reform and listing, you He has also served or is currently serving as a signing accountant for China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

After the stock reform and listing, large state-controlled commercial banks have made remarkable achievements: their financial and risk prevention and control capabilities have been enhanced; their balance sheets have been relatively solid, and their ability to create profits has been enhanced; they have built a &quot;four meetings and one layer&quot; as the core. A corporate governance system recognized by the international capital market; forming a layout for international operations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now, bank reform and development are facing more complex and severe challenges. How to build a modern commercial bank is always a difficult problem. It is a complex and arduous project that covers all aspects of strategic management, risk management, information systems and corporate culture. What is particularly difficult is that leaders of state-owned commercial banks must clarify how to balance the policy attributes and commercial attributes of state-owned banks, and achieve both economic benefits and social responsibilities while adhering to the leadership of the party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why are they motivated to revolutionize themselves? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The power of self-revolution of large state-owned banks mainly comes from the following three aspects: the determination and leadership of the state and the government to run banks well; The governance system of major banks that is in line with international standards has been established; the growth, achievements and positive actions of financial entrepreneurs and professional bankers have been achieved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let me explain by taking the effectiveness of the boards of directors of large state-owned banks as an example. The boards of directors of large state-owned banks are mainly composed of three groups of directors. One group is equity directors representing state-owned shareholders, who are from the Ministry of Finance and Central Huijin; the other group is independent directors who have international experience and risk management, law, accounting and other fields. professional knowledge; one group is the executive director responsible for operation and management, they are the central management cadres. This is a strong bank strategic management team that is both professional and political. They are highly self-motivated and have a lofty sense of mission. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Enhance &quot;Number Management Capabilities&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2018, as a visiting researcher at the Finance and Development Research Center of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University, you focused on in-depth research on issues related to China’s banking industry and financial system reform, summarizing the impact of the 40 years of reform and opening up on accounting development and banking reform. accumulated experience. Please tell me, in the accounting field, what are the main questions you raised and the experiences you summarized? What is the relationship between accounting and finance? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The accounting standards system, audit market construction and accounting talent level directly affect a country&#39;s accounting capabilities. Looking back on the 45 years of reform and opening up, China&#39;s accounting standards have been continuously optimized and improved to achieve industry coverage, national unification, and international standards; the audit market has undergone institutional reforms and multi-level accounting firms have been built to adapt to the national market system; accounting talent training has received attention and established The National Accounting Institute launches the National Accounting Leading Talent Project to cultivate professional forces for China&#39;s reform and development. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The more the economy develops, the more important accounting becomes.” Accounting standards for enterprises are important rules for the market economy. The CPA profession bears the important responsibility of building social integrity, and accounting talents are also strategic talents needed for national development. Accounting standards, the CPA industry and the level of accounting talents are important factors in accounting capabilities. A country&#39;s accounting capabilities reflect its economic system and government governance soft power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Huang Renyu discussed his view of big history in his book &quot;The Fifteen Years of Wanli&quot;. One of the most important theories is the country&#39;s &quot;digital management capabilities.&quot; He believes that a stable and mature business society needs to have the ability to calculate and record the resources of the entire society. Only in this way, “the flow of funds will be convenient, the physical economy will become a financial economy, the conditions for exchange will increase, the division of labor will be further rationalized, and the entire country will Can be &#39;managed by numbers&#39;&quot; - and the country can be strong. Simply put, Professor Huang Renyu believes that digital management capabilities are the foundation of a strong country. I very much agree with this point of view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Accounting capabilities are the basis of national governance capabilities. Especially in the era of digital economy, the formation and use of digital assets require the existence of the basic function of accounting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My views on the relationship between accounting and finance are clear. The finance of enterprises is finance, and the finance of society is finance. Accounting, finance and finance will be the &quot;trinity&quot; disciplines. Everyone should learn some accounting knowledge honestly, because all economic activities will eventually be tested by &quot;debit&quot; and &quot;credit&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Financial companies need to shift from &quot;extension and expansion&quot; to &quot;connotation and strengthening&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the latest Fortune 500 list, the four major banks are all in the top 50; in the selection of the British &quot;Banker&quot; magazine, the four major banks dominate the top four . In your opinion, what challenges does China&#39;s banking industry have in terms of countercyclical operating capabilities and risk control capabilities? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The balance sheet of state-owned commercial banks is no longer a simple balance sheet of commercial operating entities, but is determined by China’s economic fundamentals. Support, it reflects the distribution of financial assets in Chinese society. The asset quality of commercial banks will be highly dependent on the health of the state-owned economy and the government&#39;s financial condition. This is the main peculiarity of the balance sheets of large state-owned banks. Banks must play their role in risk agency supervision in economic operations, discover risks in a timely manner, and report risks and hidden dangers in economic operations to relevant national departments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report card of state-owned commercial banks must be based on &quot;long-termism&quot;. The rapid expansion of balance sheets requires the implementation of strict risk discipline, especially strict credit discipline. Bankers need to adhere to the spirit of professionalism more persistently, absorb the lessons of the last round of deleveraging, improve the quality standards of lending and purchasing bonds, manage the entrance of non-performing assets in an incremental manner, and at the same time continuously consolidate the quality of existing assets and maintain sufficient Capital and loss absorption cushion, adhere to scientific liquidity management methods, and adhere to a clean, healthy and sustainable balance sheet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At present, what reforms do you think China’s state-owned banking industry still needs to deepen? and promote which developments? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The development of the financial industry has always been highly related to the overall situation of the times. The world today is facing major changes unseen in a century, and China&#39;s financial industry has faced huge historical challenges. At this important moment in the deepening and development of international and domestic finance, the presence of Chinese financial entrepreneurs is crucial. As the world&#39;s second largest economy, China&#39;s financial industry today needs a strong team of financial entrepreneurs more urgently than ever before. They need to give full play to their leadership and lead Chinese financial enterprises from simply expanding externally to expanding. High quality and strong connotation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must protect China’s financial entrepreneurs. Finance is a risk-taking industry, and the business decisions financial entrepreneurs have to make are risk-taking decisions. If a boundaryless accountability system is used to constrain financial entrepreneurs, it will definitely stifle the initiative of financial entrepreneurs to take risks and weaken the support of finance to the real economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial entrepreneurs also play a little-known function in the operation of the social economy. They perform an agency supervisory role in the operation of the social economy. Take bankers as an example. They lend money to businesses, and what makes them feel uneasy day and night is the risk that the borrower will not be able to repay the principal and interest of the loan.因此，银行家从放贷之日起，就会定期走访企业，要求企业维护健康的财务状况，满足贷款合同要求，这种监督作用提高了中国经济发展的效率；同时，金融机构也累积了有关借款人和行业的知识，为资金有效地流向实体经济把握方向。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国创新为何会成功？因为中国的经济体量大，试错成本平摊下来很小。成功之后，创新带来的总体经济效果很大。因此，必须要鼓励这样一个试错机制，更好地吸引资本进入创新市场。这就需要投资银行的参与，我们要鼓励培养一批在中国扎根、支撑中国经济向高质量、高效率发展的投资银行家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[约瑟夫·奈：中美不会彼此构成威胁]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259615]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 07:57:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2. myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/35970adf3270835011604556288/NaBoGdbWdHEA.mp4&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; data-fileid=&quot;3270835011604556288&quot; data-media=&quot;video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;成Draft 555 &quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/35970adf3270835011604556288/NaBoGdbWdHEA.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud .com/ 93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/35970adf3270835011604556288/NaBoGdbWdHEA.mp4&quot;>;&lt;/source>;Draft 555&lt;/video>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[日常用语的“职业密码”丨人在职场]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259566]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 23:02:01&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;My friend is a senior lawyer. One day he received a call from an old classmate asking him if he had any acquaintances in the hospital. Illness requires immediate hospitalization. While socializing, the lawyer asked urgently: &quot;What crime is your father suspected of?&quot; As soon as he said it, everyone laughed, and he was stunned: He hadn&#39;t drank too much, why did his words get messed up? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years ago, this same lawyer also went to a hotel for dinner. A late brother called him and asked him which private room he was in. He replied confidently: The third court! ——Look, how much career information a person hides in his slips of the tongue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every person who speaks has an accent of varying degrees, and you can roughly &quot;hear&quot; the place where he was born or grew up. Those who seem to be born to speak standard Mandarin are actually just his accent. In daily communication, people often use words, sentences, and quotations from scriptures, which often bear the imprint of their profession, or it may just be the inertia of their language. There is a saying that one should never leave one&#39;s profession in three words. Sometimes, a single word or sentence may reveal the professional information of the person concerned, which can be regarded as a kind of &quot;intentional&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three hundred and sixty lines, each line contains jargon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A colleague from a provincial TV station is as clumsy as I am, and he usually talks about his country of origin and &quot;doesn&#39;t understand the language&quot;. He specializes in supervisory reporting, and I am a little worried about whether his undercover investigation will go smoothly. A colleague who &quot;doesn&#39;t know the language&quot; proudly revealed to me: Because of his strong accent, when he went to the dialect areas of his hometown for secret visits and open checks, it was even more confusing, and he was regarded as a native of his hometown. Once &quot;crossing districts&quot;, chickens and ducks often have to break out in a hurry, not knowing what song the other party is &quot;singing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the TV colleague has repeatedly encountered embarrassment in his dialect &quot;comfort zone&quot;. When tracking and investigating a people&#39;s livelihood complaint, he personally experienced the procedures as a local citizen. The reception staff at the Government Affairs Center had seen countless people and were quite experienced. He discovered a &quot;flaw&quot; on the spot: You, you are... a reporter, right? Asking questions about this and that, and turning over and over again. We ordinary people are very direct when it comes to doing things, not like you! With one word to reveal the secret interviewer, the colleague pretended to smile bitterly, and had no choice but to admit that he was unlucky and go for another secret visit at another time. This time, recite silently three times: Get rid of routines, get rid of routines, get rid of routines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“What did you think at the time?” “What do you think about this?” “What are the solutions to this problem?”… Reporters’ clichés have sneaked into our daily lives. The most recent time I returned to the provincial capital from my hometown, I heard a ride-hailing call on my phone. The driver picked me up half an hour early and then went in the opposite direction to pick up the next two passengers. During the chat, my reporter&#39;s professional habit kicked in. I first asked him about his passenger status, then about his passenger background, then about his experience and feelings in the industry, and then about the competition situation in the industry. I wanted to know whether he had a ride or not, and wanted to know more about the current tailwind. The bitterness and joy of car owners. When I was resting in the service area on the way, the driver took the initiative to approach me: Boss, you are so kind. You are so polite when chatting with us and treat us as your own. Unlike some bosses who urge us to drive as fast as possible after getting in the car. No delay at all... ...I smiled and prepared to explain to him that the chat just now was just a &quot;mobile interview&quot; and he was just another of my &quot;interview subjects.&quot; As the words came to my lips, I decided to call myself the &quot;boss&quot; and respond to his gratitude: the big bosses all have people driving, and the little bosses only ride along. Favorable wind, not necessarily smooth road. If you want to go along the way, have it all to yourself without carpooling. We are all part-time workers, so we understand how difficult it is for you. ——A response that seems to reveal one’s professional identity unconsciously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Three sentences are indispensable to one&#39;s profession&quot; reveals the habits of the brain behind people&#39;s expression habits - habits of thinking.

When the real scene continues to change, people often It is difficult to transition and switch in place instantly. The longer a person stays in a certain position (position), the greater the corresponding expression inertia. &quot;Three sentences are inseparable from one&#39;s own profession&quot; also highlights people&#39;s &quot;path dependence&quot; in thinking and expression.

Discussions about this game have also become hot searches on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This phenomenon deserves concern and analysis. The plot line setting of the game is very simple. You transform into the male protagonist Gu Yi and use the first-person perspective to immersively meet, interact and socialize with six beauties with different ages, looks, personalities and family backgrounds. You can choose one of them. Develop the character deeply and make it your other half: the charming witch who loves to go to nightclubs, the intellectual sister who loves literature and art, the innocent school girl who is not materialistic, the unruly rich lady, the sexy mother who raises her children alone, and the girl who wants to be a little girl at heart. The cool CEO, the choice is yours, which one you will end up with, you can do whatever you want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, this is a male-oriented love clearance game. The target audience is men. There is no harem or side effects. It is just pure love and satisfying men&#39;s various fantasies about their significant other. There are relatively few games in this category on the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public has the impression that young people, especially young men, love to play games, which is true. The hunting and war that our ancestors engaged in in the tribal era were the first priority for survival. This has become the pursuit of power and victory engraved in genes. The mainstream favorites of men are action, combat, war, civilized hegemony and strategy. The game involves a battle of wits and courage. In this type of game, most of the male players are male. Love is either absent or is just an add-on or embellishment. There is a high probability that the game producer has established such a mental position: every man’s dream is to conquer the world. , falling in love is also about capturing a woman’s heart by conquering the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The design idea of ​​this game is very different. It just allows a very ordinary man without any cheats to fall in love with a beautiful woman. Although the game has 12 hidden endings and hundreds of route choices , &quot;Every choice you make will trigger unexpected hidden stories.&quot; However, compared with the mainstream male-oriented games on the market, it is not really complicated, nor can it be said that the workmanship is exquisite, so it must be so popular. Particularly successful is that it hits the pain points of young men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major feature of the game is &quot;real-person interactive images&quot;: six beauties with different styles are all played and photographed by real people. In the era of general artificial intelligence (AGI) led by GPT-4, it is not difficult to use AI to design stunning beauties that are more perfect than real people, and the cost is lower. This approach has already had a negative impact on the profit model of &quot;welfare girls&quot; who sell personal photos. The impact. The producers of this game went in the opposite direction, using real people to act on camera, and pre-filmed various plot lines like genuine film and television works, allowing players to choose the objects and plots they want to develop in depth, allowing players to become film and television male protagonists. , the power to control and promote the development of the plot on your own, and it can also approach the experience of interacting with real people in real life, which can be said to be thoughtful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sexual version of this game is the so-called otome game. Otome is a girl. Women choose to fall in love with men, whether they are domineering CEOs, rich second generation, celebrities, or race car drivers. In short, it is to satisfy women&#39;s perfect imagination of their significant other. In terms of proportion, there are several orders of magnitude more otome games than male-oriented romance games. In this sense, &quot;Done!&quot; I&#39;m surrounded by beautiful women! &quot;The reason why it is so popular may be because there are too few such games. Game producers ignore and underestimate men&#39;s emotional needs. In addition, &quot;live-person interactive images&quot; fill the gap, so it suddenly opens up. an ecological niche. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The popularity of this game is enough to show that the male world is not all about killing and working to make money. Men also have emotional needs. Our traditional culture does not encourage men to open up and express themselves. &quot;A man cannot shed tears easily.&quot; Men must appear strong and carry everything without being weak or shrinking. However, everyone has moments of weakness and emotions. There are times when I cannot bear the need to express myself and my emotions break down. Men are human beings too, and their spiritual world should also be cared for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, men’s voices have been absent from public opinion. In the statements of some merchants, there is even a saying that &quot;men&#39;s consumption power is not as good as that of dogs.&quot; However, this situation is changing. The values ​​and consumption concepts of the new generation of young men are very different from their parents. They care more about themselves and invest more in their own image and spiritual world. For example, in recent years, the consumption and consumption of male cosmetics have increased annually. Significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to iiMedia Consulting data, among Chinese users who choose to shop through online live streaming channels, 58% are men and 42% are women. Among them, those born in the 1980s and 1990s are the main force in shopping, accounting for 42%. The total exceeds 80%; live streaming e-commerce shopping users are mainly distributed in first- and second-tier cities, with second-tier cities leading the way with 42%. This is very different from the impression some people have.年轻男性的消费力在崛起、在井喷，是一个值得关注的趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When men convert their productivity into consumption power, they also win the hospitality of businesses. This is the rule of the game in the consumer society. &quot;It&#39;s over!&quot; I&#39;m surrounded by beautiful women! 》The fire is another footnote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, since it is a romance game, it will inevitably lead some people to discuss the relationship between games and reality. Some people worry that the quality of opposite-sex partners in romance games is much higher than in real life, which will cause players to invisibly raise their inner expectations and standards for mate selection, and lose interest in the available partners in reality. There should be a real social investigation on whether this effect exists and how big it is, and it is meaningless to talk about it in the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, a person who has to earn money to support his family and career during working hours, but only occasionally spends some time playing games during off work hours or weekends to satisfy his dreams and fantasies that cannot be realized in real life, should not be punished. Even if you are harsh, you won’t lose your sense of reality just by playing a few games, because the gravity of the real world is strong enough to pull you back to the ground. Occasionally falling into fantasy, even if it is a fantasy that cannot be realized, will make a person&#39;s heart shine, or make the soul gain a sense of relaxation and transcendence, which is necessary for a person&#39;s mental health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, if you are completely immersed and lost in fantasy due to the lack of anchors in the real world, and never want to get out of the virtual world, or use the perfect objects in the virtual world to ask for optional objects in the real world, then of course It is a pathology and not desirable. A sane adult should never go to this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[​张又侠：中国军队绝不答应、绝不手软]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259617]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 21:25:13&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 21:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[对话上野千鹤子：学术是弱者的武器丨视频]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259590]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[500万人次求助，800亿元捐赠：慈善法修正可否终结个人求助争议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259592]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2022, when a girl fell from a building, her family asked for help on Shuidichou.

Charitable organizations can raise funds publicly for public welfare purposes and enjoy tax-free treatment, which is equivalent to the use of public resources, so its beneficiaries must be a non-specific public rather than a specific individual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Personal help-seeking does not meet the purpose of public welfare, so the Charity Law did not regulate personal help-seeking at the beginning of the legislation. However, in recent years, with the help of online fundraising platforms such as LoveChou, EasyChou and ShuidiChou, personal help-seeking has become more active and prominent than charity activities, and problems in the field of personal help-seeking have also emerged one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, Luo Yixiao, a 6-year-old girl from Shenzhen, Guangdong, unfortunately suffered from leukemia. Her father Luo Er wrote an article online to raise about 2.7 million yuan for treatment expenses. Later, it was revealed that Luo Er had three houses and three companies in his home. He also said in an interview that &quot;the house in Shenzhen is reserved for his son,&quot; which caused him to be questioned. Amid the whirlpool of public opinion, Luo Yixiao died of illness, and Luo Er also returned all donations to the donors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Wang Fengya, a 3-year-old girl from Taikang County, Henan Province, suffered from retinoblastoma. Her mother requested help on multiple online platforms. In April 2018, it was revealed that his mother had donated 150,000 yuan through fraudulent donations to treat her son&#39;s cleft lip. Although the police investigation found that the donation fraud claim was untrue, Wang Fengya died of illness in May of that year, and her family was also subjected to online abuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amid repeated controversies, calls for strengthening supervision of online fundraising platforms are getting louder and louder. In 2018, under the guidance of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the three major online fundraising platforms, LoveChou, EasyChou and ShuidiChou, issued a self-discipline convention. This was upgraded again in 2020, proposing that platforms should abide by seven &quot;bottom-line rules&quot; to strengthen platform self-discipline management and improve Risk prevention level and improve social supervision mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 6, 2019, the country’s first online dispute over personal critical illness help was pronounced. In this case, Mr. Mo launched a personal fundraising campaign on Shuidichou for his seriously ill son. However, because he concealed his property and other social assistance, the fundraising platform took him to court and demanded the return of the donation. After trial, the Beijing Chaoyang District Court found that Mr. Mo misappropriated the funds raised for other purposes in violation of the agreed purpose, constituting a breach of contract. The first instance order ordered the full return of more than 150,000 yuan raised and the payment of corresponding interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the press conference after the verdict was announced in the case, Wang Min, the president of the Wangjing Tribunal of the Chaoyang District Court, pointed out that there are problems in the field of personal help for serious illnesses on the Internet, such as unclear legal definitions and overly principled provisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The judgment of the case also mentioned: &quot;At present, only departmental regulations stipulate that personal seeking help does not belong to charitable fundraising and charitable public fundraising information. Regarding the rights between the network platform and the donor in personal seeking help for serious illness on the Internet, The obligations have not yet been clearly defined.” In addition, many unclear boundaries emerged during the trial, such as whether Mr. Mo provided comprehensive information, whether the fundraising platform should provide separate items to fill in the family property item by item, whether there were insufficient verifications, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, the Chaoyang District Court sent judicial suggestions to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Shuidichou platform respectively, recommending that the Ministry of Civil Affairs coordinate and promote the legislation on personal help-seeking behavior for serious illnesses, establish and improve departmental regulations, and promote orderly personal help-seeking for serious illnesses on the Internet. carry out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Guoke, a lawyer at Beijing Zhicheng Law Firm, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that as an individual right, individual seeking help is not subject to legal restrictions or prohibitions. For example, going to the streets to beg, as long as it does not violate city management regulations; seeking help from classmates or relatives after falling ill is a small-scale personal request for help. Whether the information for help is true or not only involves both the donor and the recipient. issues of rights and obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, due to the factors of the Internet, the scope of communication and influence of personal help-raising on the Internet have changed dramatically. At this time, the authenticity of the help-seeking information has a certain degree of publicity. Netizens who make donations on an online fundraising platform are both donors and users of the platform. From the perspective of providing services to users, the platform also needs to verify the authenticity of the information of the help seekers, &quot;for our vast number of donors.&quot; Very good.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, the volume of personal requests for help on the Internet is huge. The first domestic &quot;Research Report on the Personal Serious Illness Help-Seeking Internet Platform (2022)&quot; shows that according to incomplete statistics, from September 2014 to the end of 2021, a total of more than 5 million serious illness patients posted help information through the personal serious illness help-seeking Internet service platform, and more than 20 100 million people donated funds through critical illness help platforms including Shuidichou, with a fundraising scale of more than 80 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Individual seeking help is a relatively active and large-scale phenomenon in society at present, and it is necessary for the Charity Law to respond in principle to this.” Jia Xijin said, but the current amendment to the Charity Law includes the addition of individuals The content of asking for help does not mean that individual asking for help is regarded as a charitable activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Information inspection” rather than “information review”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a member of the Expert Advisory Committee of the Social Organization Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, He Guoke participated in the meeting discussion of the revised draft of the Charity Law. According to him, due to the essential difference between personal help-seeking and charitable public welfare activities, the personal help-seeking section did not include chapters on charitable donations and charitable fundraising. Instead, it was placed in the supplementary provisions, and in the form of authorized legislation, the Civil Affairs Department of the State Council, in conjunction with Relevant departments will formulate specific management measures separately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This draft amendment to the Charity Law clarifies: If an individual causes financial difficulties for his family due to illness or other reasons, and releases information for help to the society, the person seeking help and the information publisher shall be responsible for the authenticity of the information, and the personal assistance network service The platform shall bear the obligation to inspect information, and specific management measures shall be formulated separately by the civil affairs department of the State Council in conjunction with relevant departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Guoke believes that compared with the first revised draft, the latest revised draft has three main adjustments to the content of personal help-seeking: first, the definition of personal help-seeking puts more emphasis on the reasons of &quot;personal illness&quot;; In addition, the &quot;network service provider&quot; in the amendment is clearly defined as &quot;personal assistance network service platform&quot; in the amendment, which means that when the Ministry of Civil Affairs formulates specific management measures in the future, it is likely to re-qualify the platform party to do so. Stricter management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last adjustment is that the &quot;information review obligation&quot; that the platform should bear is changed to &quot;information inspection obligation.&quot; &quot;&#39;Review&#39; is more important than &#39;inspection&#39;.&quot; He Guoke said that the platform has not been granted the power and responsibility like government departments and judicial agencies, and cannot review the property in the name of the requester. &quot;For example, the requester said that he only has one house. &quot;The platform can only see that the real estate certificate of this house is basically true, but it cannot go to the Housing Authority to check how many properties he owns in total.&quot; This adjustment was made after considering the opinions of multiple platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jia Xijin believes that in the draft amendment to the Charity Law, it is necessary to add the principle content that &quot;the person asking for help and the person publishing the information should be responsible for the authenticity of the information&quot; because the basis for personal seeking help is still civil. In the &quot;gift&quot; relationship, the primary responsible parties are both the donor and the recipient. &quot;Whoever publishes false information is responsible&quot;; as a third party that promotes cooperation, the platform needs to conduct necessary formal reviews, such as requiring family financial information. Certificates, medical certificates, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the above-mentioned Shuidichiou case, the Chaoyang District Court held that the Shuidichiou platform has strict formal review obligations and strict supervision obligations. In this case, the court found that Shuidichiou had review flaws, but this did not affect Mr. Mo’s responsibility to return the donation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information provided by Shuidichou to Southern Weekend reporters, Shuidichou has currently strengthened measures to ensure the authenticity of fundraising cases, using technology and manual methods to pass preliminary review, reexamination, third-party review, etc. The platform will continuously review user information. Only after the platform reviews the information is correct and meets the qualifications, can online fundraising be initiated normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the materials provided by Shuidichou, the platform intercepted an average of 12 fundraising applications that did not meet the requirements every day. In the first half of the year, it intercepted and rejected a total of 2,096 fundraising applications that did not meet the launch conditions, including There are 544 illegal users who have been permanently blacklisted from the platform and are prohibited from launching fundraising again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Jia Xijin&#39;s view, individual case assistance and personal help are like &quot;after-care medicine&quot; for the plight of seriously ill families. They can exist but do not need to become bigger and stronger. She believes that it is more important to establish multiple response mechanisms, such as inclusive medical insurance and medical assistance systems, commercial insurance, public welfare advocacy and beneficiary services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[明星发声缘何遭遇舆论反弹：公共空间不应是少数人表演的舞台]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259569]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 19:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the discussion surrounding the incident of vicious dogs injuring people in Chongzhou, Sichuan has gradually extended to the management and disposal of stray animals in the city. On many public affairs, it has become a vent for social emotions for a period of time, including relatively rational thinking and suggestions, as well as more radical remarks and propositions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This phenomenon of &quot;using topics to vent emotions&quot; is common in itself, but one of the phenomena is very interesting. After several well-known actors made remarks on personal social media calling for kindness to stray animals, their comment areas were blocked. Netizens were &quot;outraged&quot; and a large number of fans left messages to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; and &quot;drop followers&quot;. Many actors have closed the comment area to passively fight against the storm of public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of traditional communication studies, it is generally believed that film and television stars rely on their personal charm, the persona they have created in public affairs for a long time, as well as the fans and traffic they bring, and they have great influence in the field of public opinion. With huge appeal and influence, the joint &quot;voice&quot; of several celebrities can often change the direction of public opinion. However, in this incident, the celebrities without exception failed in the field of public opinion. This is thought-provoking The changes actually include a series of quite profound social changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“A stage for the few” and “a society for the majority”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the era of television media and the early era of online media, “unitary subjectivity” and “central focus” are reflected Incisively and vividly, young people in frontiers and villages gaze at the love affairs and joys and sorrows of middle-class people in the reinforced concrete forests of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou from fashion magazines, movies, TV and computer screens, and have not yet realized the need for self-subject expression. Most cultural products are produced in megacities and only depict life there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, the society of the majority revolves around the stage of the minority, and regards the lifestyle of the super urban middle-class citizens performed on the stage as an advanced, civilized, and universal And one-size-fits-all paradigms and templates. The imitation of this lifestyle is considered a fashionable, progressive, and civilized pursuit, while the opposite is considered an archaic, backward, and barbaric conservatism. This “progressivist life template” is not original to urban middle-class citizens, but an imitation of the lifestyles of European and American middle-class citizens who achieved modernization and urbanization earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cultural industry born in super cities produces cultural products through imitation and interpretation of this &quot;progressive life template&quot;, and then promotes it to the whole society through cultural products. As one of the producers of cultural products, actors must naturally accept this &quot;progressive life template&quot; and the ideas behind it. Otherwise, not only will they not be able to work smoothly, they will even find it difficult to gain a foothold and live in the circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So it is not difficult to see that although the acting styles of the actors are different, a considerable number of actors have a highly consistent personality in life: they love nature, sports and travel, and have certain ideas. Depth and artistic taste, emphasis on material enjoyment and emotional value, and a &quot;personality&quot; that is passionate about environmental protection and public welfare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, in a series of public discussions derived from the &quot;Vicious Dog Injury Incident&quot;, some celebrities&#39; actions to speak out for &quot;kindness to stray animals&quot; are not only a commercial act to create and maintain their personalities, but also their A true reflection of values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, some celebrities have ignored two issues. Their standards of civilization are based on their living environment and lifestyle. The probability of them being bitten and injured by off-leash dogs and stray dogs in their lives is extremely small. . But this is not the case for ordinary people. Data from a public health study show that taking Zhengzhou City, Henan Province as an example, there are more than 90,000 rabies exposure risk cases in Zhengzhou City every year, and dog bites account for 77.68%. More than 80% of bite cases occur in urban areas. This The data also does not include bites that did not seek medical attention. Judging from Zhengzhou’s population base of nearly 13 million people, the probability of being bitten by a dog in the city is not low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is a natural and instinctive reaction for people to become anxious about their own safety due to the incident of vicious dogs in Chongzhou and their own living environment. While some celebrities make empty calls to &quot;be kind to animals&quot;, they lack in-depth rational thinking about the incident itself, let alone put forward any meaningful suggestions and feasible solutions. Instead, they deliberately pretend to be &quot;civilized&quot;. Inadvertently pushing those netizens who are worried about their own safety to the opposite side of &quot;barbarism&quot; will naturally encounter fierce backlash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the trend of flattening of social public opinion in the Internet era has become more and more obvious, and &quot;mono-subjectivity&quot; has been eliminated. The routine of eliminating freedom and pluralism under the banner of freedom and pluralism has increasingly aroused public concern. In the past, it was difficult for a few celebrities to appeal to fans and reverse the trend of public opinion. On the contrary, this can easily make &quot;vocal&quot; stars become the target of public criticism and the vent of collective emotions, leading to a situation where the comment section has collapsed and fans have collectively lost their fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let the screen return to the screen, let the reality return to reality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with developed countries, our country’s modernization process is too rapid. In the process of modernization, the film and television industry has developed particularly As a result, a considerable part of the public lacks an accurate understanding of the profession of actors, and a considerable number of actors also lack an accurate positioning of their profession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confusing the image of an actor in reality with the image he plays in opera is a common psychology among people in pre-modern society. Our overly rapid modernization process has more or less extended this psychology to modern society. Actors play politicians, scientists, business tycoons and other social elites on the screen, as well as the profound lines of these elite images. , making it easy for the audience to ignore one of the most basic facts:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter how professional and outstanding the doctors, scientists, and soldiers the actors play on stage and screen, their most professional and outstanding field is still acting. Only in the field of performance are they truly outstanding experts. They may shine in other areas outside their majors, but in the final analysis they are still ordinary people. Once their opinions exceed their professional fields, they can easily make the same mistakes as ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, because of the ultra-high income level and ultra-high social status that this profession achieved during the economic boom period, which far exceeds that of general industries in society, the above basic facts are easier to ignore. Not only do a considerable number of ordinary people generally follow celebrities as &quot;opinion leaders&quot; who are morally and intellectually superior to others, there are also a considerable number of actors who increasingly express opinions outside of their own profession on public affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the &quot;disenchantment&quot; effect brought about by the flattening of the Internet, more and more people&#39;s perception of celebrities is becoming increasingly mature, and they can objectively realize that acting is just one of many professions, and celebrities are among other professions. Apart from the halo of his acting career, he is just an ordinary person who specializes in art. When faced with some public opinions expressed by celebrities that are not constructive, lack in-depth thinking, and are purely emotional expressions, we dare to express different opinions instead of blindly following them. This is also an important reason why the comment sections of many celebrities have overturned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The thoughts derived from this &quot;rollover&quot; incident are actually more than the above two points, but one thing is absolutely certain: in a social environment where the pre-modern state lasts too long, the post-modern state comes too early. , the standards of &quot;civilization&quot; are set by a few people and required to be accepted by the majority, which is definitely not a civilized plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 19:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[香山论坛 外国代表怎么看？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259611]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 18:57:12&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 19:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[2023软科世界一流学科排名：中国内地收获17个世界第一学科]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259578]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 18:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 27, Ruanke, a professional institution for higher education evaluation, officially released the 2023 &quot;Ranking of World-Class Subjects of Ruanke&quot; (ShanghaiRanking&#39;s Global Ranking of Academic Subjects).

After that, he lived with a colostomy bag for 9 months, and it was not until 2020 that the situation improved. In April 2021, Matthew recorded a reunion show with the other five leading actors of &quot;Friends&quot;. Everyone recalled the scene of filming twenty years ago. Matthew used a black suit and black tie to hide his departure from Chandler. The storm that followed. He and they all said to let the story stop there and not to make another comeback series just to imagine &quot;what are they doing now&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last episode of Season 10 of &quot;Friends&quot;, the six people were about to start a new life. Chandler hugged his adopted child and said: &quot;Little guys, look around, here are you The first home, a happy place, full of love and laughter.&quot; Everyone left their keys, and Phoebe said, &quot;I think that&#39;s the end of it.&quot; Joey nodded, and Monica began Crying: &quot;It&#39;s harder than imagined.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/sPYxVGOlW9oSgmfmOAbLLtbmNQkoqxbtnoGJb7OL.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;633&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/sPYxVGOlW9oSgmfmOAbLLtbmNQkoqxbtnoGJb7OL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 256080&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Friends&quot; stills&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;On October 28, 2023, Matthew Perry passed away at his home in Los Angeles. According to local police reports, the cause of death was drowning caused by cardiac arrest. There were no drugs and no signs of homicide. Of course, there was no goodbye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the play, the crying Monica fell into Chandler&#39;s arms, and he said: &quot;It&#39;s okay, it will be fine.&quot; Rachel suggested going for coffee again, and Chandler once again They used cold jokes to relieve their sadness: &quot;Where to go?&quot; They pushed the stroller outside. In the barrage, an audience member said that every time at this time, he would immediately go back and watch the first episode. The audience naturally did not explain the reason. Perhaps a long time ago, he understood what another Chandler - the famous American writer Raymond Chandler - said in the novel: &quot;To say goodbye is to die a little. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
