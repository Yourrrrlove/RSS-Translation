In order to relax him and quickly complete the shooting, the photographer joked: &quot;It is summer at 30℃!&quot; Wu Dajing showed a big boy&#39;s smile and cooperated patiently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This day is November 12, 2023. What a coincidence is that on November 12, 2018, five years ago, Wu Dajing won the Men’s Short Track Speed ​​Skating World Cup Salt Lake City Station in the 2018-2019 season. In the 500-meter final, he won the championship with a time of 39.505 seconds, breaking his own world record set at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in February 2018. As of now, Wu Dajing is still the holder of both the Olympic record and the world record in this event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past five years, Wu Dajing has experienced the glory brought by his fame-at his peak in 2018, he broke the world record three times in a year and set a new Olympic record; he has also experienced the trough-injury. Under heavy pressure, he finally stood on the highest podium at the Beijing Winter Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Beijing Winter Olympics, for 28-year-old Wu Dajing, it was the best time to retire after success. Age and injuries will only bring greater uncertainty to the future. Retiring at this time can be regarded as a perfect ending. But Wu Dajing chose to continue standing on the ice rink. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Recently, I have been carrying out rehabilitation and restorative training step by step.&quot; Wu Dajing said. In 2023, he participated in some domestic competitions and will continue to participate in other competitions next year and beyond. What he is most worried about is the recurrence of old injuries, like an elusive bomb. He doesn’t know when it will explode next. “So now I try to extend my cycle as much as possible and make a sufficient long-term plan. It must be very scientific. Be careful and you may not make it to the end if you are not careful at all.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/ S9aj6ar7tSsUFdbTKqDeVvt1OQirCsFfBxBOri95.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;664&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/S9aj6ar7tSsUFdbTKqDeVvt1OQirCsFfBxBOri9 5.jpg&quot; data- key=&quot;258960&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Dajing feels relaxed&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has been preparing for the Beijing Winter Olympics for 4 years. Before the game, he injured his right knee, and then the waist injury recurred. &quot;It was a particularly hard blow at that time, because you didn&#39;t know if you could play. All the athletes had gone to train, and I was the only one lying there. It was quite uncomfortable. One thing, I was very helpless. At that time, I felt like a child, knowing nothing and unable to do anything.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, he withstood the pressure, worked with the team, and won the short track speed He won a gold medal in the men&#39;s and women&#39;s 2000-meter mixed skating relay, which was also China&#39;s first gold medal at the Beijing Winter Olympics. After the game, he and Fan Kexin hugged each other tightly. As the oldest athletes in the men&#39;s and women&#39;s teams, they have both experienced three Olympic Games. &quot;At that moment, we really understood each other with just one look. It was like watching a movie in my mind, and all the details of the preparations for the war in the past few years emerged.&quot; Wu Dajing recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people once said to him, &quot;Otherwise you will quit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There will also be entanglements. At some point, I feel that otherwise I will quit. Because no matter from the perspective of Neither my physical condition nor my age condition is in the best state, so I weighed and compared myself, but in the end I still felt that I couldn’t let it go. Skating has always been my passion. As an athlete, I have been engaged in my favorite industry for so many years. It doesn&#39;t mean that you can just let it go. For me now, it&#39;s easy to persist, but it&#39;s not easy to let go.&quot; Wu Dajing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dajing has created many histories of short track speed skating in China and is called the &quot;King of Sprints&quot; by the International Skating Union. He is the first Chinese men&#39;s Olympic gold medal in ice racing and the first Chinese men&#39;s Olympic gold medal in short track speed skating. At the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, he won the championship with a time of 39.584 seconds, breaking the world record and Olympic record, and won the first and only gold medal for the Chinese team at the Winter Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From being a sparring partner for the women&#39;s team to becoming a world champion, he described it as &quot;every time he is breaking through and challenging himself.&quot; Now, facing this new journey, what he needs to challenge is his mentality, which is different from the past. &quot;Enjoy the process of preparing for the war, the process of training and sweating every day, and the process of tiring myself to exhaustion every day. The rest is Yes, results are no longer the only important thing to me. The moment athletes are on the court, they actually have to prove that they have achieved good results, but now I am more passionate about it, so I use a better mentality to do it. Prepare, maybe it will be better. I can still be an athlete, I can still stand on the ice rink, I think this is enough.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/6MjG4run4Y6Vsj6fnq8MCbiQaR6oKgma3UK60fpH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;664&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/21/6MjG4run4Y6Vsj6fnq8MCbiQaR6oKgma3UK60fpH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258963&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Dajing&#39;s sense of relaxation&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Childhood&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Training Ground and New Identity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, Wu Dajing became A coach in the short track speed skating project of Jilin Provincial Sports Bureau Ice Sports Management Center. As both an athlete and a coach, this is a new beginning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, before Wu Dajing became a coach, he began to play the role of a link in the team very early. In September 2018, Wu Dajing was elected as the new captain of the Chinese short track speed skating team. In addition to improving his own skills, he also began to cultivate the team&#39;s ability to collaborate with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This reminded him of his childhood, when young athletes were afraid of their coaches. When Wu Dajing first joined the national team, because the coach&#39;s energy was limited, he would give more time to the main athletes. &quot;So when I was in my first and second year with the national team, I felt very happy if the coach could say a word to me one day and help me with a move. The coach talked to me, and I was happy all day long. &quot;When he didn&#39;t talk to me or give me guidance, it was a very uncomfortable day.&quot; Wu Dajing recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“At this time, we need someone in the team who is both a senior and a teammate to stand up and tell us the most real physical condition or problems we encounter, and then we will help. He changes, or helps him avoid some detours. We have been doing this in recent years.&quot; Wu Dajing pointed out that the coach&#39;s attention may affect the mentality of the players, and he hopes that he can play such a role - - Help coaches share attention, help juniors, and become a bond between them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/dfB1Y8mru3d3ckt0RXHCdlFcFA4jvDkLBuHchq2g.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;664&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/dfB1Y8mru3d3ckt0RXHCdlFcFA4jvDkLBuHchq2g.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258965&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Dajing feels relaxed&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From personal responsibility to collective glory, Wu Dajing fully feels the strength and value brought by a team. &quot;Skating left me with beautiful and scary experiences in my childhood. From the collective life I experienced as a child, to the relationship I had with my teammates when I grew up, to the time I was able to represent my motherland in competitions and perform on the world stage. Himself. This experience is wonderful and worth remembering.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his childhood, he usually had to get up at more than 4 o&#39;clock in the morning. The winter in the Northeast is extremely cold. There are no street lights in small cities. His mother rides a bicycle to take him to the ice rink, and the road is covered with snow. Before dawn, they put up a light on the ice rink. &quot;We were training there, and parents used big brooms to sweep the ice on the ice rink. There was a clear division of labor - there were those who swept the ice and those who poured the ice. Then these parents I spontaneously built a simple shed and lit a fire inside to keep warm.&quot; There is no board wall outside such a training place, and parents use snow to build a protective wall to prevent the children from falling out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a child, because the price of skates was relatively expensive, I usually bought larger ones. My feet hurt, and they often bleed and scab over and over again. &quot;But when I was a child, I didn&#39;t feel bitter. (I even) felt very comfortable on the ice rink, and I could even put on skates. I didn&#39;t feel cold at that time, but now I think about it, it was really cold. I am particularly afraid of the cold now. Maybe when I was a child It’s too cold.” Wu Dajing smiled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dajing once said that he has a pair of &quot;very ugly feet&quot;. He has accumulated &quot;pimples&quot; due to ill-fitting skates and accumulated training over the years, and even has deformed bones in some places. &quot;I said that I must wear good shoes and buy good shoes in the future. The thing I am most sorry for in my life is my feet. They have been witnessing my journey of more than ten years. From the beginning of skating to now, I still feel He is still accompanying me through hardships. He often jokes that I will take better care of my feet in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Wu Dajing built a charity ice rink in his hometown of Jiamusi, Heilongjiang to support his hometown. The short track career is located at the &quot;wild ice rink&quot; where he trained when he was a child. He hopes to give his children more training venues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, this public ice rink has a lot of people in winter, including children and ice skating enthusiasts, and they organize themselves to maintain the ice rink. &quot;I don&#39;t think I built it in vain. Many people use it. Children, the elderly, and young people can all skate here. I think it is a very meaningful thing and can help more people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Dajing also feels happy to devote himself to public welfare undertakings. After he won his first gold medal at the Beijing Winter Olympics, he got a golden dungeon and would sleep with it in his arms. But on the closing day, he decided to auction off the Golden Dundun and donate the proceeds to the &quot;Project Hope·Dajing Ice and Snow Charity Project&quot; to create conditions for ice and snow sports for rural teenagers. He feels, &quot;We can help others with visible results, which maximizes its meaning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/21/MWJ2d93PXuCo5qs2C5bFLHyQCGSu4rKoDSURFtea.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;657&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/21/MWJ2d93PXuCo5qs2C5bFLHyQCGSu4rKoDSURFtea.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258964&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;February 5, 2022, in Beijing in the winter of 2022 In the mixed team relay final of the Olympic short track speed skating event, the Chinese team won the championship.

This is a new beginning, and it is enough to continue to shine in this project. Although I am in a confused period now and I feel like I still want to prove myself, my mentality will have changed a bit compared to before, but I can still stand on the training ground and exert all my strength, which is enough. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Competitive sports not only test results, but also test mentality. In the past, you just had to practice well by yourself, but now it is different. You need to think about the entire team and the young athletes, and the responsibilities on your shoulders are heavier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We can no longer joke with our teammates as unscrupulously as before. This team needs to move forward. I am also slowly exploring this process, not only integrating into the feelings between our athletes and teammates, but also improving my identity as a coach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If you use three keywords to describe yourself, what would you do?

When we are athletes, we have a strong motherland to support us. We are lucky to have such a glorious moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness is that I can still do what I like to do now, and maybe in a few years, I can still engage in this career. This is the happiness of the moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The expectation is that I will face the choice of transformation in the future. Whether I am an athlete, a coach, or engaged in other things in the industry, it will be a new test for me. I am looking forward to the arrival of a new life, and I am particularly yearning for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I have just recalled many moments, is there any moment that stands out? A photo that particularly impressed you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Dajing:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Actually, we have very few group photos at home, almost five or six in total. In the summer of 2022, the three of us came to Beijing together and brought our medals. At that time, I wore the clothes to receive the award and stood in the middle to take a group photo. It has been many years since I spent the Spring Festival with my parents and lived a good life with them for a period of time. I will take on more responsibilities as a family in the future. I developed this photo and display it at home. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How will you overcome anxiety and pursue boldly A &quot;perfect&quot; life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Dajing:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When my performance has not improved, I will be anxious. I am considered an old athlete in this industry, and I will still be anxious in the future. Facing the transformation of a new identity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I get older, this feeling of anxiety becomes more and more obvious in me. I think it is normal to have anxiety at different times. A good attitude does not mean that you cannot be anxious, but how to deal with anxiety? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For me, it means finding my own direction - really thinking about what I want to do and whether to prepare in that direction. After doing this, I feel less anxious. You will have more sense of responsibility when working towards your goals, and you can just do the rest and work hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are there any veterans you admire very much who have persisted on the court?

Many &quot;witty comments&quot; have become new &quot;internet memes&quot;. For example, the People&#39;s Public Security University of China commented that &quot;gathering is like a fire, scattering is like a police station&quot;, Tianjin Normal University commented that &quot;dormitory conditions are suspected of violating the Geneva Convention&quot;, and Northeast Petroleum University commented that it has &quot;excellent traditions and has served two presidents.&quot; &quot;, Changsha University of Science and Technology&#39;s &quot;E-Sports 985, Rap 211&quot;, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public opinion field responded to this &quot;college rating&quot; with mostly voices of goodwill and tolerance. There is no other reason. This &quot;college rating&quot; is an evaluation from the perspective of students. &quot;Satisfaction&quot; and &quot;trust&quot; are the standards based on which students rate and write comments. It is more interesting and participatory than those conducted by other institutions. &quot;University Rankings&quot;. While public opinion is carnival, there are also some issues worthy of analysis: What kind of &quot;college evaluation&quot; is credible? What kind of “college assessment” do we need? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The outside world has never lacked criticism of major universities, and the evaluation forms are also diverse: from various university rankings by independent institutions, to industry association breakdowns to professional lists, to formal or formal or professional rankings in the corporate world. There are many private comments. However, almost no assessment can satisfy everyone, and no set of &quot;rankings&quot; or &quot;lists&quot; can eliminate controversy. The reason is naturally the wide variety of evaluation subjects and evaluation standards, as well as the merits of the selection process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to cater to various &quot;university rankings&quot;, Chinese and foreign universities have also tried their best. For example, in order to improve their ratings, some domestic universities recruit international students regardless of the quality of their students; many European and American universities have also engaged in a lot of marketing operations in order to attract international students. The result is that the evaluation criteria for these rankings are not only one-sided, but some of them are even untenable, which in turn damages the credibility of the institution itself. As far as colleges and universities are concerned, it is not trivial to make a bloated face and look fat, nor is it advisable to cut off one&#39;s feet to fit the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even &quot;seemingly fair&quot; statistics such as faculty strength and scientific research quality are not always fair and reasonable in reality. There has long been a saying in the market that &quot;a higher level of knowledge will lead to a higher level of magic.&quot; One foot&quot; coping strategy. For example, in the 2021 mathematics subject rankings announced by USNews, Qufu Normal University surpassed Peking University to rank first, which surprised the industry. However, the process of its publication is &quot;reasonable and well-founded&quot;, relying on techniques such as &quot;paper filling&quot; and &quot;self-citation within the school&quot; that are fully in line with the evaluation procedures. However, it is self-evident how authoritative this evaluation standard will be in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, Chinese and foreign universities have expressed dissatisfaction with such evaluations, and actions to &quot;withdraw from rankings&quot; have occurred one after another. In 2022, the National People&#39;s Congress, Nanjing University, and Lanzhou University will withdraw from the world university rankings, announcing that they will no longer provide data for them and will not be led by &quot;foreign indicators.&quot; In November 2022, Yale Law School publicly announced its withdrawal from the &quot;US News American University Rankings&quot; on the grounds that its rankings are &quot;seriously flawed&quot; and the institution itself is &quot;for-profit&quot; in nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to &quot;College Ratings&quot;. On the surface, &quot;university ratings&quot;, like &quot;Dianping&quot;, &quot;Taobao ratings&quot; and &quot;Douban ratings&quot;, are consumers&#39; &quot;quality evaluation&quot; of businesses, but college students&#39; evaluations of universities are a bit more subjective and arbitrary. In essence, this &quot;college rating&quot; activity can be called an extension of Internet subcultures such as &quot;taunting each other,&quot; &quot;cross-talking,&quot; &quot;advanced trolling,&quot; and &quot;self-hatred.&quot; It can be regarded as an alternative &quot;college evaluation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of this, the evaluation of colleges and universities by students living in this mountain will be affected by the &quot;observer effect&quot; after all, and it is impossible to be completely objective and fair. This time in the &quot;Hupu University Ratings&quot;, comments such as &quot;No matter how bad the alma mater is, it still has to be given full marks&quot;. There are also many comments and ratings that are truly &quot;just for fun&quot;. For example, Tsinghua University&#39;s rating is only 5 There are many points, and the hot comments are also entertainment words that &quot;it feels like a school&quot;. Such &quot;complaints&quot; obviously should not be taken too seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the &quot;Hupu College Rating&quot; that triggered a carnival of public opinion is destined to be just one of many &quot;college evaluations&quot;. It is not very scientific and authoritative, but it is enough to remind the outside world. : Diverse assessment subjects, changing assessment standards, and different assessment procedures mean that any form of college assessment can only have a reference value within a certain range, rather than a golden rule that everyone must follow, and colleges and universities are not worthy of it. Go to great lengths to match certain &quot;rankings&quot; and &quot;lists.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what exactly is a good college assessment? Furthermore, what qualifies as a good school? There are already thousands of reviews on colleges and universities in the public, and a good school does not rely on one or two good rankings to become a good school. In addition to those indicators that are often used in evaluations and are easily spoiled, the quality of students, alumni achievements, peer certification, and job market recognition are the hard indicators that are difficult to shake, and it is not possible to make rapid progress in a short period of time by relying on opportunism. true indicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the saying goes, &quot;a teacher chooses a disciple, and a disciple chooses a teacher,&quot; the same is true for the relationship between universities and students. There is a two-way selection between schools and students. School rankings are essentially rankings of students. Most of the evaluations of colleges and universities by the corporate world are also based on the evaluation of graduates, which leads to hierarchical differences among colleges and universities. After all, major universities are not products placed on the shelves for anyone to choose from, nor are they music/movies/games that everyone can buy and experience. The group of students who are qualified to evaluate colleges and universities have often been screened by college evaluations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the writer Fang Long, a scholar says he has discovered a great truth and must impart his knowledge to others. As a result, a group of young people gathered around him, and the university was born. It was initially a union of professors and students. &quot;Studying together in the right way&quot; is the foundation of the university and the starting point for all evaluations.

Its public welfare, importance, and particularity determine that &#39;serving the people and serving the country&#39; has always been the industry&#39;s most important value.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[水庆霞下课：中国女足没落，不仅是教练不行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261006]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-21 12:45:06&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/21/7m9LighL8qVbKNRtWZHKLier5cSBeoCSk0oDM9Gk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;741&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/7m9LighL8qVbKNRtWZHKLier5cSBeoCSk0oDM9Gk . jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258986&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On August 1, 2023, Shui Qingxia, the head coach of the Chinese team, was in the Australian Adelaide Ryder raises his hands to greet fans after the 2023 FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup Group D match against England. The Chinese team lost to England 1-6 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of November 20, 2023, the Chinese Football Association officially It was announced that Shui Qingxia will no longer serve as the head coach of the Chinese women’s football team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shui Qingxia, born in 1966, is a famous Chinese football star and the main player of the Chinese women&#39;s football team in its most glorious period. After retiring in 2001, Shui Qingxia took up the coaching position. In the women&#39;s football match at the Olympic Games in July 2021, the Chinese women&#39;s football team suffered a 2-8 defeat to the Dutch team. Shui Qingxia was appointed at a critical moment and officially served as the head coach of the Chinese women&#39;s football team in November 2021. In two years, she has brought victory and hope, as well as defeat and even despair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2022, Shui Qingxia led the Chinese women&#39;s football team to defeat Japan and South Korea in succession, winning the Asian Cup again after 16 years. But by 2023, the women&#39;s football team has failed to meet people&#39;s expectations in the three major events of the World Cup, Asian Games and Olympic preliminaries. In the World Cup, the Chinese women&#39;s football team failed to qualify in the group stage and was defeated by England 1-6. They lost to Japan in the Asian Games and missed the finals. The same group failed to qualify in the Olympic preliminaries and bid farewell to the 2024 Paris Olympics in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After winning the 2022 Asian Cup, Shui Qingxia received overwhelming praise. It is generally believed that she is the best coach candidate because she comes from the women&#39;s football team, has a brilliant resume, is well versed in the laws of women&#39;s football and athlete psychology, and has been the coach of the local team for a long time. But after consecutive losses this year, what awaits Shui Qingxia is a flood of criticism. Some good people dug up netizen comments and media comments from different periods and found that the overlap rate between those who praised Shui Qingxia at the beginning and those who are now endlessly belittling her is quite high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This itself is a reflection of the impetuous side of Chinese football, which is true for managers, practitioners and fans. After Shui Qingxia&#39;s dismissal, many people believe that some players who have not been reused before will get more opportunities. But if you know a little bit about football, you will know that the plight of the Chinese women&#39;s football team is by no means a problem that can be solved by changing the coach or a few players. Its backwardness is all-round. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/mUZslvouVksauZg35GdBF6w1FVEv56vmyt2C6ZQk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/mUZslvouVksauZg35GdBF6w1FVEv56vmyt2C6ZQk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258982&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 22, 2023, after the Group A match of the women&#39;s football group match of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese team players bowed to head coach Shui Qingxia (first from right).

She initially practiced track and field, and did not receive professional football training until she was 17 years old. However, due to her hard training day and night, she was drafted into the national team more than a year later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shui Qingxia once recalled that the training conditions in the 1980s were very bad. The training ground only had dirt with stones on it. When she was thirsty, she could only drink tap water. This is not an isolated case. Most of the Sonorous Roses of that year stood out under such difficult conditions and competed in various world competitions under difficult conditions. However, the development of women&#39;s football in the world has long passed the era when &quot;only relying on fighting spirit can lead to victory.&quot; Shui Qingxia&#39;s dismissal is itself a metaphor for the complete decline of the &quot;old women&#39;s football model&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the defeat to England in the 2023 World Cup, player Wang Shuang choked up and asked: &quot;I dare say that we have to train harder and pay more than those players in Europe. Why can&#39;t we always get what we want?&quot; Results?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of absolute strength and the laws of competition, it is useless to rely solely on hard work. Moreover, compared with the hard-working Chinese women&#39;s football model, &quot;enjoying the joy of football&quot; is the basis of competitive rules. As England player Lauren James said after that game: &quot;The game is like playing football in the street when I was a kid. We are enjoying football to the fullest.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, around the world, In an era when no one pays much attention to women&#39;s football, the Chinese women&#39;s football team can earn its own glory through hard training and fighting spirit. However, as the professionalization of women&#39;s football is advancing rapidly, major football powers are injecting men&#39;s football and market-oriented models into women&#39;s football, and operating women&#39;s football leagues based on the mature operating experience of men&#39;s football professional leagues and professional clubs, causing the Chinese women&#39;s football team to completely lose its past advantages. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/UaIoO4PJESvwEdtA8hA0cqoQzvJIM2eDQxVWYFbt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/UaIoO4PJESvwEdtA8hA0cqoQzvJIM2eDQxVWYFbt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258983&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 11, 2023, Chinese women&#39;s football team members trained in Adelaide, Australia, to prepare for the Women&#39;s World Cup&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concepts also need to be adjusted. Many people&#39;s judgment of women&#39;s football is still stuck in the Rose Rose era. This concept not only refers to performance, but also to the environment. For example, when talking about the plight of the women&#39;s football team, many people immediately said that the women&#39;s football team is too poor. It would be great if the unsatisfactory men&#39;s football team could allocate part of the money to the women&#39;s football team to solve their worries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This statement shows that you don’t understand football. The rapid development of women&#39;s football in the world in recent years often benefits from highly professional and market-oriented football leagues. What the men&#39;s football team provides to the women&#39;s football team is not only the club&#39;s operating model and advanced management, but also a steady stream of financial support. &quot;Raising women&#39;s football teams with men&#39;s football teams&quot; has long been the norm in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese men’s football team is indeed unsatisfactory, and the Jinyuan Football Team in previous years has also been criticized. But anyone familiar with the history of women’s football knows that after the retirement of the Sonorous Rose generation, the Chinese women’s football team fell into a long-term trough. The “Little Indian Spring” in recent years also benefited to some extent from the abundant funds of the Jinyuan Football Era. Although the level of the Chinese men&#39;s football professional league is not high, it is still more professional than the women&#39;s football league and can provide a relatively complete structure and system, as well as financial support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also with this support that the income of Chinese female football players is not low, and the training conditions have also been greatly improved. The &quot;Global Women&#39;s Football League Research Report&quot; released by FIFA in 2021 shows that the average annual operating costs of Chinese Women&#39;s Super League clubs rank first in the world, close to US$2 million. At present, the income of players in the Chinese Women&#39;s Super League is not lower than that of their foreign counterparts, and overseas players even face the problem that the salary for playing abroad is not as good as at home. Therefore, it is no longer appropriate to use the word &quot;hardship&quot; to describe their living conditions. The real gap in women&#39;s football is not in economic conditions, but in the backward understanding of the laws of football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/yTpRowYElStPUo5e8VN1DB5ZEoD3qWqc10RP8nSo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;663&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/yTpRowYElStPUo5e8VN1DB5ZEoD3qWqc10RP8nSo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258984&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 6, 2022, the Chinese women&#39;s football team defeated the South Korean team in the 2022 Women&#39;s Asian Cup final, winning the Asian Cup for the ninth time and standing in Asia again after 16 years.

Shui Qingxia once concluded that European players generally run and sprint at a high intensity of more than 700 meters in a game, and some good players can reach more than 1,000 meters, while the average Chinese women&#39;s football team member only reaches 300 meters. When faced with the opponent&#39;s pressing, it is difficult for the Chinese women&#39;s football team members to even look up and watch the ball being passed, and their past technical advantages have long since disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of Chinese women&#39;s football has always had many inherent problems, including limited popularity of grassroots football, an imperfect youth training system, and a low level of professional leagues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current Women&#39;s Super League is still very irregular, the schedule changes frequently, and it is impossible to cultivate a fan base. Data shows that the average number of spectators per game in the first 16 rounds of the Women&#39;s Super League this season is basically around 1,500, and many spectators are family members and friends of players, or employees of sponsors, and there are very few real fans. In comparison, the women&#39;s Premier League averaged 5,099 attendances per game last season, and the &quot;North London Derby&quot; between Arsenal and Tottenham attracted 47,367 people. Last season’s Women’s Champions League quarter-final match between Barcelona and Real Madrid attracted 91,553 spectators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve results, the national team often adopts the outdated long-term training model, which in turn affects the league schedule and quality, making it even more difficult for players to receive the influence of high-level competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/mKvr4Rzijkzh9uGFSE5nNW7whRPzZ1V0EtF8j8cN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/mKvr4Rzijkzh9uGFSE5nNW7whRPzZ1V0EtF8j8cN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258985&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 1, 2023, during the final round of the Asian second stage (Group B) of the Paris Olympic Women&#39;s Football Qualifiers held in Xiamen, the head coach of the Chinese team Shui Qingxia (Left) Coaching player Wang Linlin.

The situation of campus football is well known to everyone. Some time ago, there was a hot topic of &quot;giving ten minutes between classes to the children.&quot; If they can&#39;t even have ten minutes between classes, how many children can get the right to play football? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The past model of women’s football was a light league and a heavy emphasis on the world series. This is a kind of inertia of thinking. Its backwardness is not only because it has lost the soil of the league, but also because even if it is limited to the World Series, it is vulnerable because it despises the laws of modern football and sports science. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the Women&#39;s World Cup, Chen Wanting, the coach of the technical research team, once lamented that it was difficult for her to see the video materials she needed in the Chinese Women&#39;s Super League. Because the video materials provided to her were only shots from the perspective of the television broadcast, not the entire scene. As we all know, fans watch the game from different perspectives than coaches watch the game. What the coach needs is full-field analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coaches cannot keep up with the development trend of women&#39;s football in the world, and it is difficult for players to improve their technical and tactical abilities. The old training model can no longer adapt to the needs of modern football. It involves running circles and practicing without thinking. On the field, facing the opponent&#39;s rapid transition of offense and defense, you will be at a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, the Chinese women&#39;s football team has always faced a situation of alternation between hot and cold. Every time there is a World Series, people call for concern and development of women&#39;s football. After the competition, there is silence again. Many people use women&#39;s football as a tool to crowd out and ridicule men&#39;s football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is praising and beating Shui Qingxia, or using the Chinese women&#39;s football team to compete with the men&#39;s football team, it is actually meaningless. What the Chinese women&#39;s football team urgently needs to do is to calm down and truly understand and learn the development laws of world football. There is no other way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公安部：缅北共向我方移交电信网络诈骗犯罪嫌疑人3.1万名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260984]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-21 11:23:02&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/21/7da4b29319035f4df2cd598d3cac1f3c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;7008&quot; height=&quot;4672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/21/7da4b29319035f4df2cd598d3cac1f3c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258936&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the current serious situation of telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar, the Ministry of Public Security has deployed public security agencies in Yunnan and other places to continue to promote border police We have cooperated with law enforcement and carried out multiple rounds of crackdowns.

On the left is the poster of the movie &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; and on the right is the movie &quot;The Biography of Oppenheimer&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; which has been released globally (except Japan) since the summer of 2023 It is adapted from &quot;Oppenheimer: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Father of the American Atomic Bomb&quot; (CITIC Press, 2023) written by two Pulitzer Prize winners, Kay Byrd and Martin Sherwin. The movie can be said to be very faithful to the original work. There is almost no key dialogue between the characters that is not based on the original work. Of course, due to the time limit of the film, many conversations from different occasions were grafted into one scene. For example, President Truman said that Oppenheimer was a &quot;crying scientist&quot; in a text message to his acting Secretary of State Acheson, not in person in the movie, but Oppenheimer did say it to Truman in person. &quot;I feel like my hands are stained with blood,&quot; and Truman replied, &quot;The blood is on my hands, let me worry about it&quot; (p. 393). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, reading &quot;The Biography of Oppenheimer&quot; can help us understand many scenes in the movie. When Oppenheimer first met his devoted girlfriend Joan Tatlock (a child psychiatrist who committed suicide at the age of 29), Joan discovered that he was very familiar with the different schools of psychoanalysis. If we don’t read the biography, we may generally understand that Oppenheimer is amazingly knowledgeable in both arts and sciences, which is indeed true; but the biography tells us that Oppenheimer understood the different schools of psychoanalysis and his own treatment. It is related to his experience, which also explains the incident in which he gave his Cambridge tutor Blackett (the 1948 Nobel Prize winner in physics and a famous British socialist) a &quot;poison apple&quot; when he had a mental breakdown (p. 61). When the movie deals with this incident, Bohr, a Danish physicist and one of the founders of quantum mechanics, picks up an apple, only to have it snatched away by Oppenheimer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/7y9GAec50FgO29ZkMoUxJCO3Hqq0Uc4lSttAE4xP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;1125&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/7y9GAec50FgO29ZkMoUxJCO3Hqq0Uc4lSttAE4xP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258847&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Oppenheimer (1904-1967). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oppenheimer had many mental crises in his youth. It was with his upper-middle-class Jewish family that related to family background. His father immigrated to New York from Frankfurt, Germany in 1888 and gradually became a successful clothing businessman. However, discrimination against Jews was widespread in Western society at that time. In June 1925, when Oppenheimer was preparing to study at the University of Cambridge in England, his Harvard undergraduate tutor wrote this recommendation letter to him: &quot;You can tell from his name that he is a Jew, but there is nothing common about him that is Jewish. Characteristics. He is slender, handsome in appearance, and has the air of a humble gentleman. When considering his application, I don’t think you need to have any concerns because of his Jewish background.” (Page 52) Oppenheimer’s friend La Isidor Rabi (who won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance, which is now widely used in hospitals) later recalled: &quot;I don&#39;t know if he considered himself Jewish, I think he fancied that he was not Jewish. I I remember he once said to me, &#39;I find Christianity very confusing, its mixture of blood and grace.&#39; He said that was what attracted him&quot; (p. 98). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oppenheimer&#39;s Jewish family background was obviously one of the important factors in his transition from an apolitical physicist to an active participant in political activities after 1936, because he had to rescue several Relatives who were persecuted by the Nazis helped them immigrate from Germany to the United States. But the more important factor that prompted him to care about politics was that California, where he taught at the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, was the home base of radical political movements in Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal. In 1934, the famous author Upton Sinclair almost became governor with his &quot;Plan to End Poverty in California.&quot; In 1938, left-wing Democrat Cabot Olson was elected governor of California with the open support of the state&#39;s Communist Party. His campaign slogan was &quot;Building a United Front Against Fascism&quot; (p. 142). Oppenheimer&#39;s girlfriend, wife, brother and sister-in-law were all dues-paying members of the Communist Party of the United States. The ex-husband of Oppenheimer&#39;s wife joined the Lincoln Detachment funded by the Communist Party of the United States in 1936 and died on the battlefield defending the Spanish republican system. Kenneth May, a doctoral student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, was the head of the Communist Party of the United States in Berkeley (page 172). He went to Oppenheimer&#39;s house several times to discuss political issues. Years later, he proved that in democracy The &quot;May&#39;s Theorem&quot; about simple majorities is very important in mathematical theory. Haakon Chevalier, a French literature teacher at the University of California, Berkeley, became a good friend of Oppenheimer. In 1934, he translated into English the novel &quot;The Human Condition&quot; by French writer André Malraux (who later served as President de Gaulle&#39;s Minister of Culture), which was set during the Chinese Revolution in 1927. In the spring of 1937, Chivalier accompanied Malraux on a visit to California. (Page 147) In the subsequent hearings on Oppenheimer in 1954, the &quot;Chivalier incident&quot; became the focus of questioning Oppenheimer&#39;s &quot;national loyalty.&quot; This incident has been prominently shown in the movie and will not be discussed further here. Biography can be helpful in understanding the &quot;Chivalier Incident&quot; in the movie: Chvalier and many of Oppenheimer&#39;s Communist friends believed that the United States should be informed of the plan of the United States to try to build an atomic bomb before Hitler&#39;s Germany. The Soviet Union was the ally that made the greatest sacrifice in the fascist war. Oppenheimer agreed with this view in principle, but he firmly opposed personal leaks through the back door and believed that the US government should inform the Soviet Union (page 282). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/CmZwCvdycnQzIrLl2wwBY1fhuGbElNuCFWucs4Oy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;708&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/CmZwCvdycnQzIrLl2wwBY1fhuGbElNuCFWucs4Oy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258845&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lewis Strauss, Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (first from left) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course , we can criticize Oppenheimer for being too naive. However, most scientists who participated in the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; were deeply disturbed that the achievements of 300 years of modern science were mainly reflected in the creation of atomic bombs that could destroy mankind. On October 5, 1943, Oppenheimer&#39;s spiritual idol, the Danish physicist Bohr, escaped from Nazi-occupied Copenhagen by hiding in the bomb bay of a British bomber. After he came to Los Alamos, the site of the Manhattan Project, he persuaded Oppenheimer to turn his attention to the postwar consequences of the atomic bomb. Bohr believed that the Soviets must be informed of the existence of the nuclear bomb project and guaranteed not to pose a threat to them in order to avoid a postwar nuclear arms race (p. 319). In the spring of 1944, Bohr held private meetings with Roosevelt and Churchill, but failed to persuade the leaders of the United States and Britain to share plans for atomic bomb production with the Soviet Union. Despite this, most scientists who participated in the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; still regarded Bohr as God and Oppenheimer as a prophet of God (p. 326). Interestingly, Oppenheimer called the first atomic bomb test the &quot;Trinity Experiment,&quot; implying that man was becoming &quot;God&quot; (p. 679). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Oppenheimer participated in the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; and became its scientific director in order to build the atomic bomb before the Nazis, then he was already very reluctant to the decision to drop the atomic bomb in Japan (this The reason why he told President Truman that he had blood on his hands). By the summer of 1952, Oppenheimer was clearly and firmly opposed to the United States experimenting with a hydrogen bomb that was thousands of times more powerful than the atomic bomb. &quot;Opposing the development of the hydrogen bomb&quot; was one of the two accusations against Oppenheimer (the other one was the aforementioned &quot;Khiva&quot;) in the 1954 hearings held by U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lewis Strauss (the main scene of the movie). Lié incident&quot;). But in fact, opposition to the development of hydrogen bombs is the unanimous opinion of the Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, chaired by Oppenheimer, whose members include Nobel Prize winners in physics Fermi, Lawrence, and Harvard University President Conant (page 495) . The hydrogen bomb (fusion reaction), which is more terrifying than the atomic bomb (fission reaction), will definitely escalate the nuclear arms race. As Vannevar Bush, who had a great influence on the formulation of U.S. science and technology policy after World War II, said when testifying in support of Oppenheimer at a hearing in 1954: &quot;I maintain that that experiment (referring to the 1952 U.S. hydrogen bomb experiment ) made it impossible for us to reach the only feasible agreement with the Soviet Union, which was that neither side would conduct experiments again.&quot; (Page 626) George Kennan, the proposer of the &quot;containment&quot; strategy not shown in the movie, also opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. When he attended a hearing in 1954 to defend Oppenheimer&#39;s participation in the left-wing movement when he was young, he said, &quot;If the church only focused on his youth when judging St. Francis, he would not have become what he later became.&quot; In fact, as early as January 1950, after an in-depth discussion with Oppenheimer, Kennan wrote a report in the form of a &quot;personal note&quot; to Secretary of State Acheson opposing the development of the hydrogen bomb, and Acheson told Kennan He said that after writing this report, it would be best to consider resigning. After leaving the government, Kennan spent the rest of his life at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (p. 503). This also shows that the strategy actually implemented by the United States in the Cold War was not Kennan&#39;s &quot;containment&quot; but the National Security Council (NSC) drafted in April 1950 by Paul Nitze, who took over as director of the Office of Policy Planning of the State Department after Kennan resigned. - Document No. 68, which clearly rejected Kennan&#39;s &quot;no first use of nuclear weapons&quot; policy proposition. (Page 507)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The villain in the movie is undoubtedly Strauss. He not only fought against Oppenheimer as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, but also continued to fight against Oppenheimer as chairman of the board of directors of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. An interesting example is: Strauss opposed Oppenheimer&#39;s proposal to hire Kantolovitch, the author of The King&#39;s Two Bodies, because he refused to require the University of California to require teachers to swear an oath not to join the Communist Party, despite a later U.S. Supreme Court decision UC’s oath requirement is unconstitutional. Strauss was a self-made millionaire. In 1917, when he was 21 years old, he worked as an unpaid assistant to future U.S. President Herbert Hoover. He used this as a springboard to get the opportunity to enter a Wall Street investment bank ( page 427). He was extremely ideologically opposed to the domestic and foreign policies of Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal. At the same time, he is extremely sensitive and has a pathological ego. A scene in the movie is that at his 54th birthday party, he wanted to introduce his son and daughter-in-law to the &quot;celebrity&quot; Oppenheimer, but because that day President Truman denied the objections of Oppenheimer and other scientist advisors. Oppenheimer was in a very bad mood over the hydrogen bomb suggestion and was very rude to Strauss&#39;s son and daughter-in-law. This was one of the reasons why Strauss held a grudge against Oppenheimer. But Strauss was cunning and knew that Oppenheimer, as the &quot;Father of the Atomic Bomb&quot; on the cover of Time magazine, would not be easily brought down completely. Therefore, he only held a meeting within the Atomic Energy Commission to discuss whether to revoke Oppenheimer&#39;s safety. Internal hearings on the permit, without letting Senator McCarthy intervene, because he believed that the extremely hysterical McCarthy might mess things up. Strauss finally got his wish, and the hearing revoked Oppenheimer&#39;s security clearance, but still said he had no doubts about Oppenheimer&#39;s loyalty to the country. Oppenheimer was able to retain his position as director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, but he was completely eliminated from U.S. technology and defense policymaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Einstein appears at the beginning and end of the movie. Einstein is quoted in the biography: &quot;Oppenheimer&#39;s problem was that he fell in love with a woman who didn&#39;t love him - the U.S. government... The problem was actually very simple. Oppenheimer only had to go to Washington and tell Officials, they&#39;re all fools, then go home” (p. 596). Einstein also suggested that Oppenheimer leave the United States to conduct research in Europe, but Oppenheimer&#39;s response was: &quot;Hell, I love this country deeply.&quot; This is Oppenheimer&#39;s tragedy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 11:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[池田大作 “真正的成功的人生是什么呢？”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260976]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-21 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/20/LzbyXRcNYzMvh1Rfw8pMR2QZejt5jYRjMxY1i7mh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;865&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/LzbyXRcNYzMvh1Rfw8pMR2QZejt 5jYRjMxY1i7mh. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258930&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On April 24, 1979 local time, Daisaku Ikeda held a press conference in Tokyo, Japan , announced his resignation as president of the Soka Gakkai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1996, a &quot;nuclear weapon threat exhibition&quot; was held in San Jose, the capital of the Republic of Costa Rica in South America. hold. At the opening ceremony, just as the participants solemnly sang the national anthem in unison, suddenly, a series of children&#39;s voices came from the &quot;Children&#39;s Museum&quot; across the wall. That was the laughter of primary school students who were impatiently waiting for the opening of the exhibition. The bursts of laughter disrupted the guests&#39; speeches many times. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The lively and energetic laughter of children is a symbol and embodiment of peace. These laughters are filled with the power of hope to fight against the &#39;nuclear threat&#39;.&quot; Daisaku Ikeda at the opening ceremony Listening to the children&#39;s voices, I smiled and said, &quot;This is the indicator of a sound society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Daisaku Ikeda is the third president of the Soka Gakkai of Japan. He expanded the scope of the Soka Gakkai. scale and developed it into the largest religious organization in Japan. He also actively participated in politics and founded the Komeito Party in 1964. To this day, Soka Gakkai remains the main supporter of Komeito. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Daisaku Ikeda’s greatest contribution was to promote the secularization of Nichiren Buddhism. For Ikeda, Nichiren Buddhism is a philosophy of life that actively integrates into the modern world and society and actively faces all challenges in it. Ikeda devoted his life to promoting culture, education, and peace, and won the United Nations Peace Prize in 1983. Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, he proposed the initiative to normalize diplomatic relations between China and Japan in the 1960s. He was received by Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, and was awarded the title of &quot;Peace Envoy&quot; for Sino-Japanese friendship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aversion to war, the desire for peace, and the exploration of the dignity of life ran through Ikeda’s life until the end of his life. The Soka Gakkai of Japan announced on November 18, 2023 that Daisaku Ikeda, honorary president of the Soka Gakkai and founder of the Komeito Party, passed away on November 15, 2023, at the age of 95. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Dialogue is the foundation of peace&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On January 26, 1975, a special rally was held in Guam. This was one of the bloodiest battlefields of World War II. Soka Gakkai members from 50 countries and regions around the world gathered here and established the International Soka Gakkai International, headed by President Daisei Ikeda. The place was chosen as the venue for the meeting as a symbol of the new peace movement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I was born in 1928, which was a war-torn era. In my young mind, I had already deeply realized that nothing is more tragic and nothing is more cruel than war, so I I made up my mind to never let such inhumane tragedies continue to happen in the future.&quot; In 2020, in an interview with Global magazine, Daisaku Ikeda recalled the origins of his desire for peace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1928, Daisaku Ikeda was born in Tokyo. His family made a living from seaweed farming. There are eight children in the family, and Ikeda ranks fifth. The era when Ikeda grew up was a period when Japan was moving towards war under the leadership of the military government. Japan was plunged into the abyss of world war, and all walks of life in the country - from families, factories, schools to religious groups, were forced to serve in the war effort. All opposition voices were brutally suppressed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1937, Japan launched a full-scale war of aggression against China. Ikeda&#39;s eldest brother Kiichi was drafted into the army, followed by his three brothers. Ikeda often mentioned Kiichi in his conversations and writings. He said that when Kiichi came home on a vacation, he described to him the brutal behavior of the Japanese army in China, and his tone was full of disgust. He also mentioned that after the war, the whole family was looking forward to Kiichi&#39;s return, but in the end they waited for the news that he had died on the battlefield. The scene of his mother silently accepting Xiyi&#39;s white urn was something he would never forget in his life. &quot;Aside from anger... I deeply understand how cruel, ignorant and meaningless war is.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a boy, Ikeda&#39;s home was destroyed twice in air raids. He also personally experienced the Tokyo bombing on March 9-10, 1945, in which more than 100,000 people were killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of World War II, Ikeda was 17 years old. He described: &quot;The young people at that time were left with an indelible spiritual void. It was not just the country that was burned. The hypocrisy of the fanatical militaristic values ​​that had been instilled since before the war was exposed after the war. There was nothing left, so it immediately fell apart.&amp;nbsp;Many young people fell into the despair of &quot;not believing in anything&quot; because of this. This seems to be an inevitable conclusion.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such despair also occurs in Regarding Ikeda, he wrote, &quot;For those who once glorified war and sacrificed many young people on the battlefield, but after the war they transformed into intellectuals pursuing peace and democracy. No matter how they dressed themselves, I absolutely cannot believe the rhetoric of these powerful people.&amp;nbsp;”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the turbulent international situation of the last century, Ikeda has always played the role of a messenger of peace. He firmly advocated: dialogue is peace fundamental. Since 1970, he has been engaged in dialogue activities with representatives from all over the world in the humanities, politics, traditional beliefs, culture, education and academia. He seeks consensus from dialogue and finds solutions to the complex problems facing humanity. More than 70 of these conversations have been published in books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During his lifetime, Ikeda co-authored &quot;Looking into the Twenty-first Century&quot; with the British historian Toynbee, co-authored &quot;Spiritual Lessons of the Twentieth Century&quot; with the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, and co-authored with Jin Yong Author of &quot;In Search of a Glorious Century&quot;. Since November 16, 1995, Ikeda and Jin Yong have met many times in Hong Kong, China and Japan, during which they even exchanged letters and never stopped communicating. Jin Yong once said: &quot;The conversations are impromptu, sometimes at the dinner table, sometimes during tea talks, sometimes while admiring the beauty of the landscape and the garden.&quot; They focused on many issues such as the return of Hong Kong, Buddhist philosophy, literature, etc. There was a serious discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1993, shortly after the end of the Cold War, a research institution was established on the east coast of the United States adjacent to Harvard University. Originally named &quot;Boston 21st Century Research Center&quot;, it was renamed &quot;Ikeda Center for Peace, Education, and Dialogue&quot; in 2009. The center expands the peace and humanitarian network by inviting experts and scholars from various fields around the world to hold various seminars to conduct in-depth discussions on peace, human rights, environment, education, culture and other issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Advocating Sino-Japanese friendship as a common man&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 8, 1968, at a rally attended by more than 10,000 Soka Gakkai students At the meeting, Daisaku Ikeda made a speech that was considered &quot;bold&quot;. He called for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and proposed specific steps to achieve this goal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, many Japanese regarded China as an enemy country, and China was relatively isolated in the international community. Ikeda&#39;s suggestion drew criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, this suggestion also attracted the attention of some people in China and Japan who were concerned about the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, including Zhou Enlai. In addition, Kenzo Matsumura, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives who supported the restoration of normal relations between the two countries at the time, also contacted Ikeda after his speech and urged him to visit China. However, Ikeda believes that politicians should start this matter, so he suggested that a delegation of Komeito members should visit China. Sino-Japanese relations began to improve, and the two countries finally restored diplomatic relations in 1972. In May 1974, Ikeda led a delegation to visit China, and he led delegations to visit China many times in the following decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 1974, during their second visit to China, Ikeda and his delegation were received by Deng Xiaoping, then Vice Premier of the State Council. Zhou Enlai, who was hospitalized due to illness, met with Ikeda and all members of the Soka Gakkai&#39;s second visit to China in Beijing despite the objections of the medical team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years later, Daisaku Ikeda still remembered this interview vividly, &quot;Premier Zhou once said to me when looking forward to the 21st century that the last 25 years of the 20th century will be the most important period for the world. The whole world must respect each other on an equal footing and encourage each other for mutual benefit. Premier Zhou also said clearly in a bold voice, &#39;I hope that the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship can be concluded at an early date.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The year after the meeting with Premier Zhou, that is, 1975, since there were no universities in Japan open to Chinese students to study abroad at that time, Ikeda personally acted as a guarantor, so that the first batch of six publicly funded overseas students in New China could smoothly study at Soka University he founded. Soka University was the first school in Japan to accept publicly funded international students from China, and has since continued to accept publicly funded and self-funded international students from China to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the world was in a tense period of confrontation between superpowers, and nuclear weapons seriously threatened the survival of mankind. Ikeda expressed his hope that as a common man, he could do his best to ease the tense situation at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ikeda visited China, the Soviet Union and the United States in 1974 and 1975, and was received by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, Soviet Prime Minister Kosygin, and U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He described the situation at that time:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“From 1974 to 1975, I visited China, the Soviet Union and the United States one after another, directly having dialogues with the heads of state, and exploring the situation from the perspective of a private person. A way to ease tensions. At that time, in addition to the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, there was also tension between China and the Soviet Union, which made the world face a crisis of tripolarization.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&quot;When I visited China for the first time in May 1974 , visited the large-scale air-raid shelter built by Beijing citizens and was known as the &quot;Underground Great Wall&quot;, and felt firsthand the threat posed by the Soviet Union to the Chinese people. In September of the same year, I visited the Soviet Union for the first time. When meeting with Prime Minister Kosygin, I frankly Asked him if the Soviet Union had any intention to attack China. Prime Minister Kosygin asserted that the Soviet Union had no intention of attacking or isolating China.&quot;&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&quot;In December of the same year, I visited China again with this information. During this visit to China During this period, I had the honor to meet with Premier Zhou Enlai. During the meeting, we jointly confirmed the importance of Japan and China working together for world peace and prosperity.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&quot;Here, I heard Premier Zhou Enlai say that China We will definitely not become a superpower. Based on the content of my previous dialogue with Prime Minister Kosygin, I am convinced that the day of Sino-Soviet reconciliation will not be too far away. In fact, history has proven that my prediction was right.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br >;&lt;br>;&quot;In January 1975, I visited the United States and met with Secretary of State Kissinger in a lightly snowing Washington. During the meeting, I told him that Premier Zhou earnestly hoped to conclude a treaty of friendship between Japan and China at an early date. Dr. Kissinger expressed his great Agree.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&quot;On the same day, I met Prime Minister Ohira Masayoshi (then Minister of Finance) in Washington. I conveyed Dr. Kissinger&#39;s words to him and emphasized the importance of concluding a treaty. Prime Minister Ohira I fully agree and will work hard to realize it. Three years later, in August 1978, the &quot;Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship&quot; was finally formally concluded.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A society eager for change&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In mid-August 1947, defeated Japan was under the control of the Allies. At night people can only see dim lights flickering in temporary shacks or bomb shelters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Daisaku Ikeda’s later recollection, at a time when everything was in dire straits, the entire Japanese society was eager for change. Calls for democracy could be heard on every street corner, and the faith of a generation collapsed. At this time, young people are eager to read classics to enrich their spiritual world and build confidence. People started exchanging books and forming reading groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, 19-year-old Daisaku Ikeda met his life mentor and the second president of the Soka Gakkai, Toda Josei. It was a Buddhist exchange meeting. Toda Castle left a deep impression on Ikeda: his hoarse and warm voice, steady demeanor, and the content of his speech was not like other religious leaders, and it did not contain empty terms and theories at all. It is very down-to-earth, as if the highest truth exists in daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Toda was rebuilding the Soka Gakkai, the organization he had founded in 1930 with fellow educator Tsunesaburo Makiguchi. During World War II, Toda was imprisoned along with Makiguchi. The Japanese military government forced its people to accept state Shinto ideology as a means of sanctifying its war of aggression. The two men still adhered to their religious beliefs under oppression, and Makiguchi died in prison. The Soka Gakkai collapsed when Toda and Makiguchi were arrested by the military government during the war. Toda was convinced that Nichiren Buddhism, which focused on the infinite potential within each person, was the key to transforming Japanese society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ikeda and Toda met each other late in life, and have been friends since then. Ikeda was deeply interested in literature since childhood and began writing poetry as a teenager. When he was unable to continue his studies due to various reasons, Toda, a knowledgeable educator, personally taught him. Ikeda quickly accepted the teachings of the Soka Gakkai and joined 10 days later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Toda, Ikeda has unwavering confidence in Nichiren Buddhism and believes that its emphasis on the Buddha nature and unlimited potential of every human being can revitalize the decadent post-war Japanese society. . The key is a process of &quot;human nature transformation&quot; that unfolds in people&#39;s hearts. In that process, when a person decides to take action for his or her life and happiness, the surrounding environment and community will change for the better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the company run by Toda was on the verge of bankruptcy, Ikeda devoted himself to helping him manage the business. Unable to receive their salaries, employees left Toda&#39;s company one after another. Ikeda insisted on not leaving and was running around to negotiate with the company&#39;s creditors on debt repayment. &quot;I haven&#39;t received a salary for half a year, my leather shoes are tattered, I don&#39;t have formal clothes, and my body is extremely weak. Even so, I thought that as long as I can protect Mr. Toda, it doesn&#39;t matter even if I suffer the torture of the hungry ghost world and the hell world, Determined to never regret.&quot; Ikeda recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such a difficult period, Toda revealed his idea of ​​running a school to Ikeda - to establish a series of education from elementary school to university based on the Soka pedagogy concept of his teacher Makiguchi Tsunezaburo. School. Such an idea seemed unrealistic at the time, but Ikeda, who was only in his twenties, took Toda&#39;s words to heart. Twenty years later, Ikeda turned Toda&#39;s ideal into reality and founded a Soka education institution from kindergarten to university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1960, two years after Toda&#39;s death, 32-year-old Daisaku Ikeda was appointed as the third president of the Soka Gakkai. Fifteen years later, Daisaku Ikeda founded the Soka Gakkai International. Today, Soka Gakkai International is an international organization composed of 12 million members in more than 190 countries and regions. Ikeda wrote: &quot;Everything depends on people. Therefore, we must resolutely and thoroughly expand the good people&#39;s alliance.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; There are media evaluations, and Ikeda has led a &quot;Buddhist secular Buddhism worldwide &quot;Exercise&quot; establishes a complete education system based on religion and its values ​​to stimulate personal potential, to teach the importance of peace and contribution to society. The system runs from kindergarten to graduate school, with institutions including universities in Tokyo and California, USA. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda has repeatedly stated that the relationship between the master and apprentice of Tomoda has affected his life. Unlike other religion highlights the importance of life suffering, Ikeda emphasizes a positive and optimistic side. He often says that by helping others gain happiness, he will also get happiness. For Ikeda, happiness is &quot;loyal to himself&quot;. He believes that only in this way can happiness be increased in infinitely. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; The fundamental dignity of life &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &quot;A great human change will be able to transform the destiny of a country or even all mankind.&quot; Ikeda took this sentence Write in the preface of the novel &quot;The Revolution of the World&quot;, this novel is the masterpiece of Ikeda, describing the history and ideals of the Prices Society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the decades of the development of prices, Ikeda&#39;s work is not easy. His wife Xiangfengzi recalled that whenever Ikeda returned home for a day, he was often exhausted, and he could hardly get off his shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda was invited to give a speech at the University of California Los Angeles College in 1974. The following year, he gave a speech at the University of Moscow with a &quot;new road to east -west cultural exchange&quot; and accepted a honorary doctorate awarded by the university. When the world was in the Cold War, Ikeda did not choose to stand in the political confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda values ​​the fundamental dignity of life and regards this as the key to peaceful peace and human happiness. He believes that to achieve world peace, it will eventually look at the inner change of everyone, not the reform of social and organizational structure alone. He is convinced that this seemingly long road is the only way to build a long -lasting peace culture. The philosophical thoughts held by the Incident Society can be attributed to the term &quot;human revolution&quot;. According to the meaning of this concept, a spontaneous change will have a positive impact on the environment outside the body and promote the growth of human society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, academic institutions from all over the world have awarded the honorary doctoral degree and honorary professor of Honorary Professor, which have more than 300. His peaceful works are currently selected as university textbooks in Argentina and the United States, and more than 20 research institutes are committed to studying their philosophy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda founded a series of &lt;Span>; &lt;Span>; Increasing Education Institute &lt;/span>; &lt;/span>; from kindergarten to university. These schools are non -religious schools. The purpose of educational is: depending on the existence of each student, they are committed to discovering their potential for creating value, and instilling the concepts of peace, contributing society and global citizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From the perspective of Ikeda, children&#39;s life is a mirror of society: adults If adults advocate panic and decadent life outlook on teenagers, it is equivalent to the tender buds of hope for the future of hope. Ruthless trample. &quot;The hearts of the children who are not satisfied and deserted are unknowingly misleading the kind of cold values ​​that only determine their success or failure to determine their success or failure. Isn&#39;t that the case?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt; p>; &quot;What is the real successful life? &amp; nbsp; What is a real rich society?&quot; &amp; nbsp; Ikeda feels in the era that he has experienced. Get up with the experience of &quot;pain&quot;, and about the dignity of happiness and life, he chose to use his life to &quot;find these (questions) correct answers&quot; throughout his life. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Data source: Creation Society Global Network, Ikeda &quot;The Seed of Hope&quot;, &quot;The Wisdom of the French Scriptures&quot; (Volume 6).) &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 10:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[心脑血管发病年轻化，看看这份防治“地图”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260972]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-21 09:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ Image/23/11/20/AE893efa1f.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 720 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/ms/medias/23/11/ 20/AE893EFA1F.JPG &quot;Data-Key =&quot; 258929 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; The National Cardiovascular Disease Center is in acute myocardial infarction, stroke, In the investigation of patients, it was found that the age of the first disease declined.

On November 15, 2023, the two sets were jointly issued by 13 departments including the National Health and Health Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Southern Weekend reporters compared the scheme released in 2019 and found that the new version of the plan has been further improved in the main goals. In the cancer prevention plan, the 5 -year survival rate of overall cancer increased by nearly 3 percentage points from the 2019 plan; the mortality rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease was required to fall to 20.97/100,000 in 2022. In terms of prevention and control, it also emphasizes the movement forward and the integration of medical and defense, focusing on the whole process of health, and realizing people&#39;s health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;We all know that prevention is the most economical and effective health strategy. Both solutions adhere to prevention, strengthen the risk factors of chronic diseases The prevention of chronic diseases and high -risk crowds to the entire process management of early diagnosis, standardized treatment, and integration of rehabilitation services, &quot;said Guo Yanhong, director of the Medical Emergency Department of the National Health Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Expand the coverage of cancer screening and improve the HPV vaccine can be available. A major feature. As of 2022, the premature diagnosis rate of key cancer species in high incidence in China has reached more than 55%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Cancer screening mainly uses &quot;risk layering&quot;, organizing organizational screening for high-incidence areas and high-risk groups. Opportunity screening and standardized anti -cancer medical examinations, expanding the scope of screening. Zhang Yong, secretary of the National Cancer Center, suggested that residents with higher risk of cancer, such as family history with cancer, long -term smoking and drinking, patients with occupational exposure or patients with hepatitis B and pre -cancer diseases should be screened regularly for cancer. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Compared with the previous version of the scheme, the new version of the cancer prevention plan also mentioned that promoting conditions in regions with conditions include HPV vaccination into the local benefit of the people. The domestic HPV vaccine has accelerated the review and approval, improved the availability of the HPV vaccine, and various channels to ensure the vaccination of people with age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The &quot;Regional Exploration and Improvement Strategy of HPV Vaccine Promotion Policy&quot; issued by Kunshan Duke University Vaccine Delivery Research and Innovation Laboratory mentioned that if it can be vaccinated Further optimization in strategy can further enhance the policy influence of public health. For example, many places are suitable for girls with students or households, but for the lack of protection for migrants, or girls who drop out of school from middle school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The founding director of the Kunshan Duke University Global Health Research Center, and the person in charge of the research innovation laboratory of vaccine delivery, Tang Shenglan told reporters in the southern weekend that it is necessary to ensure that poor areas or poor people The only effective way to vaccinate the HPV vaccine of the age of the age is to include HPV vaccine into the national immunization planning, that is, it becomes a type of vaccine for free. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At present, there have been Guangdong, Hainan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Tibet, and Chongqing.

The impact of the lifestyle transformation. For example, in terms of diet, fresh fruits, vegetables, and milk in the diet of Chinese residents have indeed increased significantly, but the proportion of whole grains and beans continues to decline, while fat intake and energy supply have continued to rise. &quot;In short, it is less and less coarse grains, and more and more oils are eaten.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is necessary to vigorously advocate a healthy lifestyle and promote the scientific movement; promote the construction of the food nutrition standard system, and strengthen the guiding role of food nutrition labels. In addition, we must actively promote the construction of smoke -free environment and continue to promote smoke control measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In medicine, time is the heart and time are the brain. This is because cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are chronic diseases of acute seizures. It&#39;s closely related to time. Therefore, strengthening the first movement and improvement of the emergency system is also one of the focus of the new version of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular prevention plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In July 2022, the National Health and Health Commission issued a document to require county-level hospitals to accelerate the construction of the &quot;five emergency first aid centers&quot;, including chest pain centers and stroke centers. The new version of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease prevention plan mentioned that in 2030, the stroke centers of hospitals above the second level or above carried out venous thrombolytic technology. Places with conditions to effectively improve the efficiency of treatment by establishing chest pain and stroke &quot;first aid maps&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At the public level, strengthen the equipment equipment such as automatic body tremor (AED) in public places, and strengthen inspection of the equipment to ensure the emergency time Can be available. &quot;We are pushing the international &#39;befast&#39;, that is, it is difficult to balance, unclear, unexplained, difficulty in arms, and not spiritual. First aid call, call 120 to the hospital. &quot;Wang Yongjun, Dean of Beijing Tiantan Hospital affiliated to the Capital Medical University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The new version of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease prevention and control scheme also requires that the scope of the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in the community, explore the second-level prevention and second-level prevention and stroke patients of coronary heart disease and stroke. Rehabilitation therapy is included in the scope of family doctors&#39; contract services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The pathogenic foundation of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is atherosclerosis, which is very important for the same prevention and same treatment, early diagnosis and early treatment. Wang Yongjun also called for the establishment of vascular health management centers at the grassroots level, controlled high -risk groups of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases together, and established a diagnosis and treatment center for cardiovascular and brain diseases in large medical institutions. In the case of illness, the patient can see different experts at one time to solve the problem of common patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[江苏无锡一纺织厂起火致7人死亡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260982]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-21 07:55:40 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;pan>; According to the official micro-information of the Emergency Administration of Huishan District, Wuxi City, on November 20, 2023 At 30 minutes, a fire broke out in Diantian Run Textile Technology Co., Ltd., Qianzhou Street.

But it is not limited to cleaning, statistical data, and participating in the meeting (non -teaching). Of course, the most &quot;preparation&quot; and &quot;welcome&quot; various reviews and inspections. From the perspective of classification, these &quot;tasks&quot; are as thin as cattle. From the perspective of jurisdiction level, there are both provinces, cities, districts, and even streets. From the perspective of the jurisdiction, the educational authorities are both the competent educational department. There are other management departments, and there are even departments that &quot;can&#39;t hit one pole&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If you carefully observe these &quot;tasks&quot; that are as thin and thin, it is not difficult to find an interesting phenomen The longitudinal volume of the vertical curls is the pressure of &quot;layer layer&quot;, that is, the subordinates always automatically tend to &quot;get intensified&quot; to complete the &quot;task&quot;, and the closer to the management level, the more serious this &quot;transformation&quot; is. The horizontal volume is manifested in the competitive pressure of comparison. For example, if the department A organizes an inspection of a unit, the B will soon organize the inspection of a unit. Formism is like a infectious disease that completed in horizontal completion in the horizontal direction. After convergence, it was synchronized vertically, and the pressure was finally transmitted to the grassroots level. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The &quot;meaning&quot; of formalism &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Formatism refers to the phenomenon that managers pay too much attention to form and procedures in the process of administrative management In the interesting phenomenon of &quot;formalism automatically tends to be internal&quot;, it actually contains the problems of the &quot;administrative rights&quot; of the superiors and the &quot;false busyness&quot; of the lower level to the superior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The so -called &quot;administrative right&quot; refers The literaryism that requires &quot;ledger and leave marks everywhere&quot; requires that in simple procedures, the level of power is set up for all relevant departments, and the &quot;proceduralism&quot; that eventually make it tedious. In addition Various tricks such as pots. The most typical is the endless repeated &quot;inspection&quot; and &quot;review&quot;, which makes the process of the superiors the normal exercise of supervision of supervision of the subordinates into a obedience test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this case, the authority of the superior needs to be confirmed through this &quot;obedience test&quot; again and again, and the lower level can only choose the unconditional service to pass the &quot;test&quot;. The volume, because &quot;not as good&quot; in form means &quot;not as good&quot; in authority, which is unacceptable to the management department, so naturally, the departments mentioned in the previous article have compared with each other in form, competing with each other, competing with each other. &quot;Horizontal inner roll&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &quot;Pseudo -busy&quot; is a response to &quot;formal rights&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In the process of &quot;formal right&quot; through subordinates through subordinate tests, the grassroots are on the surface. The unconditional object in this obedience test is an unquestionable victim. But if you look closely at the grassroots reaction, you will find that they are not completely passive. &quot;Puppet busy&quot; is a negative response to &quot;formal rights&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The so -called pseudo -busyness refers to the excessive busyness that does not match the workload in the grassroots work, or simply pretending to be busy, but in fact, it has not achieved substantial progress or results. This kind of false busyness does not effectively promote work or bring substantial work results, because it is not a busy state that is based on endogenous performance, but is passive in the influence of the external environment. It emphasizes not the implementation and completion of the work itself, but to emphasize the working status of the worker, and tends to deliberately create and show a busy working state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, &quot;pseudo -busy&quot; is also divided into two types. One is the active pseudo -busy busy busyness of &quot;nothing to do&quot;, and the other is the &quot;&quot; Passive and busy. &quot; The purpose of the former is to reduce the frequency and scale of this &quot;obedience test&quot; through camouflage. The purpose of the latter is to pass this obedience test by high performance &quot;obedience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I have mentioned earlier that &quot;formal rights&quot; are essentially a kind of obedience test. The superiors confirmed their absolute dominance to the lower level through some forms of no practical significance. The only reason for this is just to prove that they have the right to do so, and this meaningless behavior is usually named by the tissue and execution of the tissue and execution. And no matter what kind of test, the final performance is busy with the order of the subordinates as a superior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After mastering this &quot;mysterious&quot;, it is naturally inclined to use &quot;pseudo -busy&quot; to pass the obedience test of the superior. If the degree of &quot;pseudo -busy&quot; is not as good as others, it means that obedience is not as good as anyone. This will inevitably trigger some inner volume of &quot;busy&quot;, that is, &quot;you are busy, I&#39;m busy than you&quot;. In the entire administrative agency&#39;s power level, the more you face the upward level of the grassroots level, the more departments you face, so the grassroots must be the worst place in the &quot;false busy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The primary and secondary schools mentioned at the beginning of this article, as education institutions, have many management levels, many management departments are not strange to be involved in &quot;extreme&quot;. And the reason for their &quot;volume&quot; is similar, that is, they are all at the lowest downstream of power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As mentioned earlier, whether it is &quot;formal rights&quot; or &quot;pseudo -busy&quot;, no matter how serious and meticulous his performance, it is impossible Bringing the corresponding governance effectiveness will become an important negative phenomenon in grass -roots governance, affect the output of governance efficiency, increase the burden of grassroots staff, trigger a sense of inefficiency, work burnout, and even more serious psychological problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; • &lt;/span>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>; (&quot;>; ( This article is only the personal point of view of the author, does not represent the position of our newspaper) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
