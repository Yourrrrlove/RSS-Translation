The &quot;home massage&quot; advertisement, the advertising images and slogans are very &quot;explicit&quot; and uncomfortable. It also arouses the curiosity of children and worries the owners. After the owners complained, the property management company removed two advertisements. The remaining advertisement looked relatively normal, but after scanning the QR code on the advertisement, there were still pages featuring a large number of sexy &quot;physical therapists.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding these marginal advertisements, staff from the property management company said that if the owner feels there is something wrong with the advertisement, he needs to provide evidence that it is an illegal advertisement. Whether it is illegal or not is up to the government. This incident quickly aroused heated discussion, which made people think: Is it true that any advertisement can be placed as long as it does not violate regulations? Do the owners have a say in what advertisements are placed in the community? Furthermore, who does community advertising revenue belong to? How should it be allocated? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These issues are actually very clear in law. Article 271 of the Civil Code stipulates that owners “enjoy the right to co-own and jointly manage the common parts other than the exclusive parts” of the building. The &quot;Property Management Regulations&quot; also stipulate that owners have the right to know and supervise the use of shared parts of the property, shared facilities and equipment, and related sites. Elevators, public activity venues, etc. are all shared by the owners of the community. In some communities, parking lots are built using roads, sites, etc. shared by the owners, and are also owned by the owners. Since these common parts are shared by the owners, the owners should naturally have the right to decide how to use them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to legal provisions, whether public locations such as elevators in a community can be used for advertising is a matter decided jointly by the owners and requires a vote by the owners. If the owners vote to place advertisements, they can also authorize the property management company to carry out specific operations. After all, it is unlikely that the owners will vote on whether every advertisement can be placed. However, even if the property management company is authorized to operate advertising spaces, it cannot do whatever it wants. When deciding what advertisements are acceptable, the views and feelings of the owners should be taken into consideration. Advertisements that the majority of owners think are inappropriate should be removed as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After solving the problem of whether it can operate, the next step is who owns the operating income and how to distribute and use it. In some communities, the owners&#39; shared portions are used for operations, and the income gained is considerable. &quot;Qianjiang Evening News&quot; once reported that a community with 15 residential buildings in Hangzhou has an annual operating income of about 1 million yuan, and some communities have an annual income of more than 4 million yuan. Advertisements in elevators, entrances, garages, etc. are an important source of income for the community. In addition, there are parking fees, business rent, venue rent, etc. Express lockers, self-service vending machines, etc. in the community need to pay rent. Some communities even charge entrance fees for telecom operators to set up base stations in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These operating income should naturally belong to the owners. According to the provisions of the property management regulations, these operating income should be mainly used to supplement special maintenance funds, and can also be used according to the decision of the owners&#39; meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in reality, many property companies often forget that they are only entrusted by the owners to provide property services, and instead regard themselves as the managers of the community. Many property companies arbitrarily add business projects in public places of communities or increase charging standards without consulting the owners. Some time ago, property companies in many residential areas in Nanjing installed electronic billboards in elevators without the consent of the owners. Previously, some residential properties added express delivery cabinets, takeout cabinets, etc. without the consent of the owners. Disputes caused by property management companies arbitrarily increasing parking fees in residential areas occur from time to time in various places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to not respecting the rights of owners on whether and how to operate the jointly owned parts, the actual operating income of many communities is also unclear. Some property companies announce operating income every year, but they only announce a total amount, which is divided into several major items such as parking fees and advertising space rentals. As for the details of each income, they are rarely announced, and of course few owners study it in detail. This leaves a lot of room for the property management company to operate. Some property companies rent out business buildings shared by owners in the community to their affiliated companies at low prices. The affiliated companies do not even charge for advertising in the community, but for unrelated companies, the charges are even higher than the market price. More importantly, some of the income may go directly into the pockets of the property management company, rather than being used as public operating income for the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The root cause of the constant disputes over community property management is that the property management company oversteps its authority and regards itself as the owner of the community and the manager of the owners. The fundamental solution to the problem lies in implementing the autonomy of community owners and allowing them to truly have the right to choose property management companies. Only then can property management companies truly change their roles and become service providers to all property owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[财富管理榜：29家最活跃金融机构，谁更用心看护您的财富？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261448]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wealth management is one of the core businesses of the global financial industry. It is one of the blue ocean markets where financial institutions are increasing competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Calculated in terms of personal financial assets, China has become the world&#39;s second largest wealth management market. As of the end of 2022, my country&#39;s wealth management market has reached 118.49 trillion yuan, a year-on-year growth of 8.7%. Among them, the total scale of bank financial management and insurance asset management accounts for nearly 62%. At the same time, the huge potential of the wealth management market has attracted financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the wealth management market heats up and competition intensifies, regulatory agencies have issued new regulations one after another. In particular, the central bank, together with relevant departments, issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Regulating the Asset Management Business of Financial Institutions&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;commonly known as the &quot;New Asset Management Regulations&quot;&lt;/ span>;) is continuing to reshape the asset management market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The wealth management business in 2023 will not be easy. The lack of high-quality assets, the turmoil in the financial target market, and residents&#39; financial management deposits and regular deposits are all testing banks and insurance companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to select evaluation objects? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Under the huge market temptation, increasingly strict supervision and unfavorable market environment, the competition between my country&#39;s commercial banks and insurance institutions in wealth management in 2023 How is the strength? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, the People&#39;s Bank of China announced the list of domestic systemically important banks. The People&#39;s Bank of China mainly evaluates and identifies systemically important banks from four dimensions: size, relevance, substitutability and complexity. Rated commercial banks are divided into different groups based on their scores. In addition to meeting minimum capital requirements, reserve capital and countercyclical capital requirements, banks in each group should also meet different additional capital requirements. Among them, core tier-one capital has the strongest loss-absorbing capacity and is the core indicator for measuring the comprehensive strength and risk compensation capabilities of commercial banks. It is also an important foundation for the operation and development of the banking industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to statistics from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center, as of the end of June 2023, the total assets of the 20 systemically important banks reached 260 trillion yuan, accounting for the total assets of my country&#39;s commercial banks. About 3/4 of the assets; in the first half of 2023, a total net profit of 1.04 trillion was achieved, accounting for approximately 83% of the total net profit of my country’s commercial banks in the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center evaluates the 20 most representative domestic systemically important banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also included nine major life insurance companies in the list for evaluation. The total original insurance premium income of the nine companies from January to October 2023 is approximately 1.8 trillion yuan, accounting for approximately 3/4 of the total original insurance premium income of the life insurance industry during the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the main force in the wealth management market, how can commercial banks and insurance institutions seize the high ground? Can you provide high-quality wealth management products and services? To this end, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has constructed a wealth management index system to comprehensively evaluate the wealth management competitiveness of financial institutions in the banking and insurance industries. The results of the &quot;Wealth Management Ranking&quot; are intended to provide investors with a decision-making reference and provide useful reference for financial institutions to improve their competitiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bank list: Six dimensions&amp;nbsp;Eighteen sub-indicators&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the wealth management business of twenty commercial banks, Southern Weekend The New Finance Research Center conducts a combined qualitative and quantitative assessment from six dimensions, and assigns appropriate weights to eighteen sub-indicators. The total weight of these qualitative and quantitative indicators is 70%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center team assigned media factor weights based on special research on the above-mentioned institutions, and invited an external expert jury to evaluate the above-mentioned companies. Conduct a review. Both scoring weights are 15% each. Among them, the media factor mainly refers to the openness and transparency of the financial institutions under investigation to media research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wealth Management Ranking Bank Ranking Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /28/67cc569e2b.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2529&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/67cc569e2b.png &quot; data-key=&quot;259835&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wealth Management Ranking Bank Ranking Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The above main dimensions are now &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;analyzed&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;and explained&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;(1)&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Wealth management scale&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;and capability&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; : Maximum weight&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;s. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are 8 secondary indicators under wealth management scale and capability, with a total weight of 35%, accounting for half of the weight of all qualitative and quantitative indicators. Therefore, this dimension is the most important consideration in measuring the competitiveness of commercial banks’ wealth management. Among them, as the basis and prerequisite for carrying out wealth management business, there are five indicators related to the retail business of commercial banks, including: retail customer scale, personal deposit balance and its growth rate, total assets under management of retail customers and its growth rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, in order to gain insight into the profitability of the wealth management business of commercial banks, the fee and commission income generated by related businesses and their growth rate are also important measurement indicators. However, given that my country&#39;s wealth management market has not formed unified regulations for the wide range of businesses included in wealth management, and various commercial banks have inconsistent definitions of wealth management fees and commissions, this list uses the quantitative indicators of each bank&#39;s net fee and commission income and Whether to publish qualitative indicators of data related to wealth management business income to roughly assess the bank&#39;s wealth management profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To sum up, the scale of wealth management embodies the basic scale, competitiveness and profitability of commercial banks’ wealth management business, and is the most important dimension to measure the level of wealth management. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;(2)&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The scale of financial management business: embodies the &quot;two strengths&quot; of financial management products&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are 4 secondary indicators under the scale dimension of financial management business, with a total weight of 16%. Since the &quot;New Asset Management Regulations&quot; were officially implemented in 2022, major commercial banks have basically completed the net-value transformation of their wealth management business, and have established wealth management subsidiaries to undertake the design, development and operation of their wealth management products. Wealth management subsidiaries have thus become the core pillar of wealth management for commercial banks. This list uses four indicators, including the issuance scale and growth rate of wealth management products, net profit of wealth management subsidiaries and its growth rate, to consider the strength of each commercial bank&#39;s wealth management business, and also reflects the market competitiveness of each bank&#39;s wealth management products after the wealth management market is standardized. and the risk-resistance ability of wealth management products after the net-worth transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;(3)&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Private banking business: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Tinjian’s comprehensive service capabilities&lt;/strong >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are three secondary indicators under the private banking business dimension, with a total weight of 12%. In order to attract high-net-worth customers, each bank has deployed private banking business, strengthened the construction of comprehensive private banking services, and enhanced the core competitive advantages of private banking business. This list uses three indicators: the number of private banking customers, the scale of private banking customer assets under management and its growth rate to measure the competitiveness of each bank&#39;s private banking business, thereby demonstrating the comprehensive service capabilities and level of each bank at the top of the pyramid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;(4)&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Wealth service capabilities: consider professionalism and initiative&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are three secondary indicators under the wealth service capability dimension, with a total weight of 7%. Different from the above-mentioned wealth management scale and wealth management business capabilities, wealth service capabilities mainly consider the professionalism of commercial banks&#39; wealth management business and their &quot;customer-centered&quot; proactive service awareness and capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the one hand, commercial banks should promptly explain the fluctuations in wealth management and financial management business income, continue to accompany customers and maintain high-level service capabilities; on the other hand, Commercial banks should attach great importance to the construction of wealth management teams, establish a wealth management talent training system, regularly organize various trainings, continuously improve the professional knowledge and service levels of financial management practitioners, and enhance the professionalism of wealth management business from both the company and client sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Who wins the bank ranking? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The bank list of the 2023 wealth management list shows that Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Merchants Bank and Agricultural Bank of China occupy the top three. With its comprehensive capabilities and comprehensive strength in wealth management, ICBC ranked first with a total score of 77.40. China Merchants Bank relied on its leading edge in private banking to overtake state-owned banks and rank second on the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wealth Management Ranking of Banks (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28 /d67de23e50.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2237&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/d67de23e50.png&quot; data -key=&quot;259836&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wealth Management Ranking Bank Ranking (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Observed by bank type, among the four major state-owned banks, the wealth management business of the four major industrial and agricultural banks, China Construction Bank, has strong economies of scale advantages and ranks high overall. Specifically, ICBC ranks first in wealth management scale, net fee and commission income, and overall ranking first; Agricultural Bank of China ranks among the top three in the list because it has the largest retail customer scale, personal deposit scale, and wealth management product scale; China Although the bank leads among the four major banks in terms of the growth rate of personal deposit balances and the growth rate of net fees and commissions, its number of retail customers and its efforts in financial investor education, professional talent team building, and the popularization of financial knowledge are China Construction Bank lost a lot of points due to lack of information disclosure, and finally ranked seventh; China Construction Bank&#39;s wealth management scale and financial business scale are comparable to ICBC, but the scale growth rate and net profit performance of its financial business have become its biggest loss points. Ranked only eighth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2023, although the trend of joint-stock bank residents&#39; deleveraging and deposit regularization has eased, the issuance of financial products and net worth performance have still continued the downturn in 2022. The market conditions have had an impact on the overall bank financial management business. In the first half of 2023, although the growth rate of wealth management scale of China Merchants Bank was negative, it ranked first among joint-stock banks and ranked second overall because its wealth management scale and private banking business performed much better than other joint-stock banks; Ping An Bank&#39;s wealth management scale ranked second among Ranked third among joint-stock banks, ranked first in net profit growth rate of wealth management subsidiaries, ranked first in growth rate of total assets under management of private banks, and disclosed the most complete and detailed information related to wealth management. Its comprehensive ranking surpassed some major state-owned banks and The leading stock bank ranked fourth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among city commercial banks, except for wealth service capabilities, Bank of Ningbo ranks first in all other indicators. Therefore, it ranks first among city commercial banks and has also been promoted to the comprehensive ranking. Fifth; Bank of Beijing and Minsheng Bank did not fully disclose information related to wealth management, and many key indicator data were not disclosed in the 2023 interim report, which seriously affected their scores and rankings, so they were at the bottom of the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dimension analysis, wealth management scale and capability dimensions embody the basic scale, competitiveness and profitability of commercial banks&#39; wealth management business. Overall, state-owned banks have a relatively large base in wealth management business, strong ability to attract personal deposits, and excellent profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The scale dimension of financial management business highlights the competitiveness of financial management products of various banks after the financial management market is standardized, and the risk resistance ability of financial management products after the net-worth transformation. Overall, joint-stock banks and city commercial banks perform well in terms of scale of financial management business. Some leaders are no smaller than state-owned banks and have good growth rates, highlighting the opportunities for latecomers to overtake in new business areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The private banking business dimension further reflects the capabilities and level of each bank in high-end wealth management services. Generally speaking, state-owned banks have a large private banking customer base and a large scale of managed private banking customer assets, and the private banking business of city commercial banks is also gradually speeding up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The wealth service capability dimension presents the professionalism and &quot;customer-centered&quot; initiative of commercial banks&#39; wealth management business. Overall, the era of wealth management has arrived, and all banks are allocating resources to this line. Each type of bank has perfect cases in this dimension. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Insurance list: Five dimensions&amp;nbsp;Sixteen sub-indicators&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Aiming at the wealth management competitiveness of 9 leading life insurance companies, We conduct a combined qualitative and quantitative evaluation from three dimensions, and assign appropriate weights to the fourteen sub-indicators. The total weight of these qualitative and quantitative indicators is 70%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center team assigned media factor weights based on special research on the above-mentioned institutions, and invited an external expert jury to evaluate the above-mentioned companies. Conduct a review. Both scoring weights are 15% each. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After adding up the above three scores, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center team ranked the total score from high to low to construct the 2023 Wealth Management Ranking Life insurance list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wealth Management Ranking and Life Insurance Ranking Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /28/1aeaf2f52f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2073&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/1aeaf2f52f.png &quot; data-key=&quot;259837&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wealth Management Ranking and Life Insurance Ranking Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The relevant dimensions are explained as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(1) Channel building capabilities. There are 8 secondary indicators under the channel construction capability dimension, with a total weight of 40%. The construction of various channels is the basic ability of life insurance companies to engage in wealth management business and even the entire life insurance business, and it is also the most important influencing factor. Most of the life insurance companies evaluated have large agent teams and various distribution channels. They have strong sales capabilities and can reach a large number of customer groups, which helps attract customer groups to participate in wealth management business and increase the wealth management customer base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to more accurately consider the comprehensive strength of the nine life insurance companies in channel construction, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center team evaluated individual insurance agent channels and bancassurance channels respectively. Quantitative indicators such as the channel’s premium income, new business value, and 13-month and 25-month premium/policy continuation rates are supplemented by qualitative evaluations of distribution channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(2) Wealth management scale and capabilities. There are five secondary indicators under this dimension, with a total weight of 25%. Life insurance companies support the development of insurance liability business through wealth management business. Therefore, the scale of assets managed and invested by life insurance companies and their rate of return have become two important dimensions for measuring the wealth management strength of insurance companies. This list uses indicators such as third-party asset management scale, investment asset scale, total investment income and rate of return as quantitative indicators of the competitiveness of the wealth management business of the nine life insurance companies, and the adequacy of wealth management-related information disclosure as the nine life insurance companies. A qualitative indicator of the importance a company places on its wealth management business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(3) Business collaboration capabilities. Major life insurance companies attach great importance to business synergy, which is also an important starting point for strengthening the competitive advantages of related products and services. As competition in the wealth management market becomes increasingly fierce, life insurance companies can form a &quot;moat&quot; by building their own &quot;ecosystem&quot; through multi-business collaboration. Therefore, this list specifically considers the measures and achievements of nine life insurance companies in building ecosystems such as comprehensive health and comprehensive pension, and encourages insurance companies to provide differentiated services to customers through the &quot;insurance + service&quot; model, thereby highlighting relevant life insurance companies comparative advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why does the champion not dominate the rankings in one indicator? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The life insurance list of the 2023 wealth management list shows that Ping An Life, China Life and Taiping Life are among the top three. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the fourteen secondary indicators in the life insurance rankings, Ping An Life is not particularly conspicuous, only in the adequacy of information disclosure and the &quot;insurance + service&quot; model. It received the highest score among the two secondary indicators of category, and none of the other 12 quantitative indicators ranked first. However, in-depth analysis found that most of Ping An Life&#39;s indicators performed at the mid-to-upper level, with very few indicators clearly lagging behind. Specifically, among the twelve quantitative indicators, Ping An Life ranks second in five and third in four. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although China Life is the &quot;king&quot; in premiums in the life insurance industry, it implements more stringent statistics in the two key indicators that reflect the renewal rate. In terms of information disclosure and information disclosure, its scores on related indicators lagged behind those of its peers, dragging down its overall score and ultimately ranking second with a gap of 1.6 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taiping Life ranks first in terms of third-party asset management scale and 25-month premium/policy continuation rate, but its total investment return rate The two indicators of new business value and bancassurance channel lag behind peers, dragging down the overall ranking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wealth Management Ranking - Life Insurance Ranking (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28 /75a5eb9098.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1188&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/75a5eb9098.png&quot; data -key=&quot;259838&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wealth Management List Life Insurance List (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the perspective of wealth management scale and capabilities, the larger the asset management scale, the higher the investment business returns, the stronger the ability to allocate large-scale assets, and the stronger the wealth management retail business will be. China Life and Ping An Life have obvious advantages in this indicator, with investment assets and total investment income significantly ahead of other life insurance companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the perspective of channel construction capabilities, China Life’s number of agents in the individual insurance channel, premium income from the bancassurance channel, premium income from the individual insurance channel, and new innovations from the individual insurance channel All four indicators of business value ranked first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The business synergy dimension score shows that each of the nine life insurance companies has its own characteristics. For example, Sunshine Life focuses on the four core needs of family customers such as health care, pension planning, children&#39;s education and wealth management, and concentrates resources to create a multi-level &quot;insurance + service&quot; ecological service system covering the entire family life cycle; Taikang Life Insurance has cooperated with Taikang The layout of the early and high-density high-end retirement communities has formed a positive interaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The list also shows that the life insurance industry will continue to bottom out in 2022. Against the background of lower bank deposit interest rates, bank financial losses, and increased volatility in equity products such as stocks, life insurance products with higher interest rates have been highly sought after for more than half a year, and even experienced a pulse peak effect for a time.

In the theme of the &quot;Twelve hours of Chang&#39;an&quot;, a certain wine industry has created Taibai wine restaurants. 》. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At the Museum of Museum of West of the Tang Dynasty, a middle-aged lady who came from Anhui and the group told the Southern Weekend reporter that she observed that people who came to Xi&#39;an followed &quot; The most is the Terracotta Warriors and the love of Li Yang now. &quot; Her tour guide, Xiao Liu, local people from Xi&#39;an, talked twice in the museum. &quot;Talking casually&quot;, he admitted that he did not understand Li Bai before his work, and he was less contact after work. In addition to a few tourists who like history, most of them, most of them, most of them, most of them, most of them, most of them, most of them, most of them, most of them. People are similar to themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Li Bai actually has no fixed place in Datang. He has neither buying a house, and he has not found that he has a lease in the relevant literature. Bai Juyi, with the rise of the official position, his living site has always rely on the emperor from the south of the city, so the level of identity determines the degree of wealth. &quot; It is not his (Li Bai) for a long time. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; In the fall of 742, Li Bai took the order of Xuanzong to enter Changan. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, some of the northern Hu people&#39;s dress began to be popular in society, including the &quot;Wupi Liuhe Boots&quot; worn by Hu people. Later, the official officially set it as a standard for officials, which is quite similar to the black leather shoes that are generally worn in modern formal occasions. In the first year of Chang&#39;an, Li Bai was also wearing a white hemp clothing symbolizing the people. This time, he put on a round -necked robe and kicked the black boots into Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Bailin&#39;s pre-line &quot;Nanling Bie Children Entering Beijing&quot;, &quot;Lobbying Wan Cheng is not early, whipped the horse to get involved in the distance ... ... , Is my generation a man of artemisia, and the depression of many years is Shu Shu, and the ideal of showing the talents can be achieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He was granted by Hanlin or Hanlin waiting for the position of &quot;lobbying Wan Cheng&quot; at the time. Unlike the Bachelor of Hanlin and participating in political affairs, Hanlin worship is a group of professional talents in various fields and stays with the emperor to serve him. After getting the emperor&#39;s luck, they have their real positions, such as Wang Shuwen, who is good at chess, Wang Yan who is proficient in calligraphy, and wait for Hanlin to get Dezong appreciation. However, Li Bai entered Hanlin with poetry as his skills. He always stayed in the position of literary attendant and never entered a regular bureaucracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Time has passed, Li Bai, who lives in the Hanlin Academy, found that his political ideals are getting rid of it. People, repeatedly promoting &quot;. Not only cannot be reused, but also squeezed by others. Once it seems that the opportunity to be at hand is actually out of reach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/8955194.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 709 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/895515d194.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259847 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Li Bai once sighed in the poem &quot;difficulty, multi-way road&quot;, and then wrote &quot;long winds and waves will sometimes hang the clouds. &quot;. The picture shows the movie &quot;Changan Thirty Miles&quot; stills. Data Map &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Yangbing&#39;s &quot;Cottage Collection Order&quot; and Liu Quanbai&#39;s &quot;Li Jun Ji Ji&quot; all pointed out more than one or two people who slander Li Bai. Wei Yan&#39;s &quot;Li Hanlin Collection Preface&quot; claimed to the surname of slander: Xuanzong once intentionally served as Li Bai as a Zhongshu shelter, but he was injured and did not achieve it for Zhang Yanzhong, the son of Zhang Homa and Zhang Shuo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Today, Li Bai&#39;s own political limitations have gradually attached great importance to and emphasized. Zeng Yueyu and Zhou Shi&#39;s novel &quot;Li Bai Trilogy&quot; depicts the official performance of Li Bai&#39;s incompetent official performance: &quot;Li Baicao intends to have a few order documents, which is a recent personnel change in the middle of the middle. Confidential. Li Bai, who was drunk, regardless of that set, he used the alcohol to use the internal news as oral news. -rign: left; &quot;>; Li Bai has a drafted document, there is no sophisticated, and the degree of leakness may not be exaggerated as describing, but this writing is based on it. Fan Chuanzheng, who wrote an inscription for Li Bai, said that he &quot;in the province in the province by drunk, you must not say the greenhouse tree.&quot; The Qing Dynasty Wang Qi also suspected that he had &quot;leaked the ban on the ban in the middle of the drunk, and the Ming emperor was sparse.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Professor Li Fangmin, a professor of Northwest University, based on Li Zhao&#39;s &quot;Hanlin Zhi&quot; research. It is possible to break the political future. He inferred that the employees of the Hanlin Academy would be more cautious than the bureaucratic bureaucracy of other institutions. He also found that Xuanzong himself had experienced the harm of drunk and quitting alcohol for life. Therefore, Li Bai&#39;s alcoholic and sinking drinking must not make Xuanzong worry about being appointed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;For Li Bai, the political center is lost, and the sparseness is sparse. Another reason for political alienation and conflict leading to his political failure was also covered to some extent. In the final analysis, Li Bai&#39;s disturbance of Hanlin was the political failure of a genius poet. &quot;Li Fangmin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Xuanzong, who once &quot;given the seven treasure beds, and the royal hand&quot;, gave the poet&#39;s grand courtesy, but did he let Li Bai participate in politics? Question mark. In Duan Cheng -style &quot;Puyang Miscellaneous&quot;, Xuanzong told Gao Lishi that &quot;this person is solidified.&quot; Meng Yan&#39;s &quot;Poem of the Intelligence&quot; records Xuanzong&#39;s &quot;with its non -gallery temple instrument, and Yu Xun remained.&quot; They all said that Li Bai impressed Xuanzong, and this person could not board the elegant hall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Bai Mingshi temperament and the officialdom of the officialdom condensed on &quot;take off the boots&quot;. Whether Li Bai has made Gaulishi take off his boots? The academic world has different views. Some scholars regard them as a novelist and do not believe it. Zhou Xunchu, a professor at Nanjing University, believes that although Gao Lishi was the most favored eunuch, according to the common sense, Li Bai could not make his life off the boots. But &quot;Li Baitian is wild and drunk, so there is no reason to exclude this matter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The movie &quot;The Biography of the Demon Cat&quot; combines Lux take off the boots and write &quot;Qingping Tune&quot;. Boots are conditions, and the two rounds are confronted, and Gao Lishi helplessly take off Li Bai&#39;s black boots for Li Bai. Li Bai was drunk and half -waking up to make &quot;Qingping Tune&quot;, and Yang Yuhuan praised it, but Li Bai bluntly said that it was not for her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Datang has you, it is really amazing.&quot; In the movie, Yang Yuhuan appreciated this true. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Emeishan Moon shines from Qinchuan &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; 744 years, Chang&#39;an City&#39;s flowers are like spring night, Li Bai drinks alone. There was no one at all, but he decided not to drink the cups quietly in this way, so he sang madly and danced, inviting the bright moon with the sky with the lone shadow on the ground. He wants to be drunk, and he will no longer exist after the drunk world and himself, and everything will be annihilated. At this time, less than two years before Li Bai was waiting for Hanlin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span>; Autumn night half a year ago &lt;/span>;, was sparse in the officialdom, and the ambition was difficult to stretch.

Li Bai&#39;s hope of seeking a way out of the court was shattered, and he urgently needed to find spiritual sustenance. There is a pair of children who have passed away, but his time with his children is far less than the Taoist priests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the Taoist Purple Palace in Jinan, Li Bai asked Taoist priest Gao Rugui to teach Taoist, and became a Taoist priest. From the three years of Tianbao&#39;s three years, he left Chang&#39;an to travel to Wu Yue from the five years to the south of Tianbao. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Du Fu and Li Bai also met at this time. Du Fu experienced the crackdown of the imperial examinations. With a common mood, he saw Li Bai&#39;s deep and dedication behind unruly. &quot;Drinking the mad song, who is flying, who is flying.&quot; This cherishment continued in the lives of the two poets, even if they did not meet again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; When in the south, Li Bai constantly witnessed the fragmented of his old friends, and his mentality changed. Arrived in Siming (now Shaoxing, Zhejiang), he died of Huanzhang, who died of his illness, and missed the years of Changan to see the golden turtle. During Jinling, another series of bad news came: his friend Cui Chengfu was degraded, Li Shizhi was forced to commit suicide, and Li Yan and Pei Dunfu were killed by a stick. Li Linfu, who was in the phase of the phase, repeatedly promoted the prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The seclusion can no longer make Li Bai feel peaceful. He often worrys about the destiny of the country, and the enthusiasm of the world in his heart burns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;He often expresses the longing for retreating to deserted mountains, but he always wants to return to the court immediately when he has the opportunity. The ideal and desire of Da Zhan Hongtu. &quot;Harbin wrote in&quot; The Road to Tongtian: Li Bi Biography &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After the second marriage in Liang Yuan, he went north to Youyan and wanted to seek development by participating in the military curtain. In the poem of the judge He Changhao, Li Bai&#39;s heart obviously, he was ashamed to stay with the Confucianism, and he was unwilling to be the same as Geng Yin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This time, Li Bai arrived in the jurisdiction of Anlu Mountain, and may see the truth that the latter is preparing to rebel. Li Bai returned from his intention. He was deeply impatient about the internal and external problems of the Li Tang dynasty, and he could only seek hiddenness from the south again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition to the Xuexue Road, Li Bai, who has already stars, is becoming more and more aware of the importance of one thing. &quot;Fifty knows and not, the ancients tasted yes. The words were made up, and it was immortal.&quot; &quot;I am determined to delete it and reflect Qianchun.&quot; He clarified that his work was hopeless, and his words may be his destiny. It can also be said that Li Bai really has the consciousness of the poet&#39;s identity, starting from the age of 50. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Bai roamed for the first time and ended in the Changan scene as the end; the later roaming, there was also an event that let him come to an end, that is, to join the Yongwang Li Yan team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At that time, the outbreak of the Anshi, people went to avoid war and separated. Wang Changling returned to his hometown. When he passed JAC, he was killed by jealous of his assassination history. Du Fu moved his family to Dazhou refuge. After hearing that Su Zong was in Lingwu ascended, he went north to Lingwu. He was captured by the rebels on the way to Changan. Poet Wang Wei was captured by the rebels to Luoyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Bai and his wife Zong&#39;s south to take refuge and live in Lushan screen wind. He once planned to lobby the King of Li Tang, Jiangnan, and the king of military diligence, and he had dealt with Wang Yannian and Wu Wang. Just after the soldiers of Yongwang, Li Yan went to Puyang after the soldiers, and invited him to be a staff member again, and Li Bai finally agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He is 56 years old, which is likely to be his last chance. This person with the complex of the Eastern Jin Dynasty felt that the old dream was in front of him. In the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Wuhu chaos, the Eastern Jin Dynasty established the country in Jinling, inherited the pulse of the Central Plains. Will the Anshi chaos achieve Xie An as the battle of the water of the water in the previous dynasty and achieve Li Bai? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Fangmin understands that Li Bai is inevitable, this move integrates an objective situation and subjective desire. He speculated that when Li Zichun was lobbying Li Bai, he hinted that Li Yan&#39;s actions in Jiangling and even the Eastern Patrol, worshiped the mystery and had the strategic purpose of operating Jiangnan. With these, Li Bai, who can impress Xuanzong&#39;s old love, has once again encouraged his heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Yingbing was defeated, Li Bai dropped one by one by death, and was sentenced to Liu Yelang. He departed from Puyang, Pan -Dongting, and the Three Gorges. When he first arrived in Wushan, he encountered a national amnesty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At this time, the rebellion war continued. Not only did the large land north of the Yellow River be in Shi Siming&#39;s hands, but the rebels continued to invade south, and the situation was very serious. The migration of thousands of miles, once the explanation of the dynasty, Li Bai gave birth to the meaning of the world again. He was in the news that Jiang Xia, the political center of the south, was waiting in the Beijing teacher Wei Liangzai. The court did not show any signs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; I hopeless, Li Bai thought of making poems at this time. &quot;Qu Ping&#39;s words are hanging from the sun and the moon, and the king of Chu is empty hills.&quot; He compared the two kinds of life of Qu Yuan and King Chu: Qu Yuan was loyal and loved the country, but he was exiled, but his resignation could compete with the sun and the moon. Poor and extravagant desire to build palace towering pavilions, and now it is gone in the early days, and it is empty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Bai has compiled a collection three times before his birth. Once was invited Han Dongqian, once it was Wei Yan, and the other was his uncle Li Yangbing. Qian Gong&#39;s manuscript, I do not know what to do. Wei Yan followed Li Bai thousands of miles, and the two were covered with the same way, and Li Bai gave him all the manuscripts at the time. Wei Bai is the editor selected by Li Bai in the condition of his health and thoughtfulness, but the &quot;Li Hanlin Collection&quot; compiled by Li Bai is mostly the residual volume of the &quot;chapters of the sentence&quot; of Anshi. Li Bai couldn&#39;t afford to be sick in his later years, and he was too late to sort out the draft. There was only one Li Yangbing around him. The poem is entrusted on the pillow, there is no choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Bai was 60 years old, returned to Puyang, and then boarded Lushan, and decided to spend the remaining years with Youxian Dao. However, after all, he could not do the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; When he heard that the power of history is re-prosperous, Li Guangzhang sent troops to suppress, and resolutely asked to participate, and returned because of the disease. Li Bai is old. But his popularity since he was young has never extinguished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;His understanding of things, his political ideals and thinking have been like this for a lifetime. People like us will not know himself ten years ago, but he has maintained a innocent young man&#39;s heart from youth to twilight. &quot;Ding Ying sighed to reporters from the south weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; 762 years, Dai Zong is ascended, and searched for Junyi to grant Li Baizuo&#39;s official position.

Some require employees to wear work clothes while others do not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This seems to be a small problem, but it is not. For example, in September, the U.S. Senate was in an uproar over whether members should wear formal attire when entering the Capitol. In the end, the U.S. Senate revised the dress code: allowing senators to wear casual attire such as hoodies and shorts. This move attracted criticism from mainstream media such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Institutions, companies, and organizations around the world are faced with a multiple-choice question when it comes to employee attire: Should they uniformly dress? What are the considerations of whether to do it or not? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/TQRExQi6pPp7lbrXzwLPQr6NFmeV6iqB9PvTA67a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/TQRExQi6pPp7lbrXzwLPQr6NFmeV6iqB9PvTA67a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259823&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Realistic Considerations of Uniform Dressing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The so-called &quot;work clothes&quot; are actually people from the same institution or organization wearing uniform styles of clothing to identify them. identity, indicate their profession, and demonstrate their responsibilities. Generally speaking, work uniforms are uniform, rigorous, and depersonalized, and are distinguished from employees&#39; personal attire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From a company&#39;s perspective, employees often have practical considerations when wearing uniforms. First of all, this is a need to shape the corporate image. Employees are uniformly dressed and neatly organized, which will leave an initial impression that the company is rigorous, serious, and positive; uniform work uniforms generally have the company&#39;s logo on them, which can play a role in promoting the company&#39;s image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Secondly, for those positions that face customers directly and have more communication with customers, such as the financial industry and the lawyer industry, uniform attire of employees can bring customers A professional look and feel helps to dispel customers&#39; doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Furthermore, for workers, wearing uniform professional work clothes can play a role in psychological suggestion, help them enter the working state, and improve their work performance. execution ability. At the same time, wearing work uniforms can also restrain the employee&#39;s personal behavior, reminding him that his words and deeds represent not only his personal image, but also the image of the unit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also some special professions, and uniform dress is to reflect the authority and seriousness of the profession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, our country has put forward uniform dress requirements for some public authorities, including the public security department, national security department, judicial department, court system, procuratorate system, Customs system, tax system, national quality inspection department, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, this time the U.S. Senate relaxed its dress requirements, which attracted criticism because public opinion was worried that this would undermine the seriousness of Congress. The New York Times wrote this: With the United States so divided right now, one of the last signs of harmony in the Senate is the dress code. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While it does not erase the deep differences beneath the surface, it does remind each senator that their goal is still to pursue majority consensus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also uniform attire for some professions, which are determined by the characteristics of the profession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, doctors’ white coats were first used to promote disinfection habits in surgical operations. The blood stains on the white coats serve as reminders; in addition, clean and tidy clothes White coats can also help doctors prevent static electricity during treatment. Many medical devices are very precise instruments, and the impact of static electricity on the equipment may mislead the diagnosis and treatment results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When doctors enter the operating room, they usually wear blue or green surgical gowns, which is related to &quot;persistence of vision&quot;. During the operation, when the doctor sees the patient&#39;s red blood and shifts his gaze to the doctor&#39;s white robe, a &quot;complementary color afterimage&quot; will appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As long as the doctor looks at the complementary color of red - such as blue or green, it can immediately alleviate the effect of &quot;complementary color afterimage&quot; and reduce visual fatigue, so the surgery Most servers use blue-green. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/2F2m5ab8kKdYI9MV0kEF1gEN4PdH8eXeiBZXTEV2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/2F2m5ab8kKdYI9MV0kEF1gEN4PdH8eXeiBZXTEV2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259824&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Relaxing the dress code is not necessarily a bad thing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some units and institutions require uniform dress for reasonable reasons, but this does not mean that uniform dress is suitable for everyone Unit does not mean that uniform dress has advantages and disadvantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people who have experienced the 1970s and 1980s may be deeply impressed by the &quot;uniform dress&quot; everywhere in that era. At that time, there was a saying that &quot;law enforcement must wear uniforms&quot;, and all public institutions would wear uniforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the one hand, it reflects the sense of honor of the profession and &quot;style&quot;; on the other hand, it regards work uniforms as the &quot;hidden benefits&quot; of the unit. Some units treat employees Clothing for all seasons is provided, but the finance department is asked to pay for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So much so that later on, some industries and personnel that did not have administrative functions at all also wore uniforms, and they were similar to those of law enforcement departments, &quot;a fox pretends to be a tiger,&quot; It undermines the seriousness of law enforcement agencies, wastes finances, and has a negative impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, starting in 1986, the State Council rectified uniform dress. In 1988, 1991, 1992, and 2003, the State Council successively issued regulations on the issue of uniform dress. The relevant notice criticized those departments that arbitrarily unified the uniform dress code, which &quot;not only affects the seriousness of the uniform dress code, but also leads to increasing financial expenditures.&quot; Later, the State Council also made clear regulations on uniform dress departments and personnel. It can be seen that it is not good to dress uniformly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Uniform dress will bring some workers a feeling of restriction, rigidity and lack of freedom. Therefore, many employees are opposed to uniform dress. A British survey showed that 61% of people looking for a new job in 2017 said they would have a negative view of any company that enforced a dress code. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to combat the monotonous uniform dress, Western workplaces gave birth to the employee activity Casual Friday (&quot;casual Friday&quot;) - employees voluntarily set Friday as casual clothing On this day, at least on this day, I can control the autonomy of dressing and be free to be myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another study suggests that the majority of the UK workforce would feel more productive if dress codes were more relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Those large companies that value creativity, such as Microsoft and Facebook, often do not impose dress code requirements for their employees. Although professionals may dress in the same way, for example, programmers love plaid shirts, and Zuckerberg wears the same casual clothes every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only do these technology companies not require employees to dress, they also make great efforts to improve the working environment, making the workplace casual, relaxed and free, thus Stimulate employees&#39; imagination and creativity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In short, it is difficult to generalize whether employees should dress uniformly. Some professions emphasize seriousness, some focus on the impression they bring to customers, some professions have special professional attributes, and some professions are more concerned about how to maximize creativity... Different demands also apply to clothing. There are different requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For workers, uniform attire is not that big a problem if the company provides free work uniforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南开段峰：“拿着金饭碗讨饭”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261413]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In June 2022, Duan Feng’s team realized the interventional brain-computer interface in the sheep brain for the first time; a year later In May 2023, led by Duan Feng&#39;s team, the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army General Hospital (301 Hospital) and Shanghai Xinwei Medical Technology Co., Ltd. jointly completed the world&#39;s first &quot;non-human primate (monkey) interventional brain-machine&quot; &quot;Interface Test&quot; was a success. This research was considered by many media to have overcome the shortcomings of invasive and non-invasive brain-computer interfaces and created the third new paradigm of brain-computer interfaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duan Feng, 46, is currently a professor, doctoral supervisor at Nankai University, and director of the Tianjin Key Laboratory of Interventional Brain-Computer and Intelligent Rehabilitation. Due to Duan Feng&#39;s outstanding achievements in the fields of brain-computer interfaces, artificial hibernation and intelligent aircraft, he was selected as Southern Weekend&#39;s 2023 Scientific and Technological Person of the Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 16, 2023, Duan Feng gave a speech at the Southern Weekend Science and Technology Innovation Conference&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/27/298bbbf676.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/298bbbf676 .jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259781&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 16, 2023, Duan Feng gave a speech at the Southern Weekend Science and Technology Innovation Conference &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the definition of the China Academy of Communications, brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is a revolutionary human-computer interaction. Its mechanism of action is to bypass peripheral nerves and muscles and directly interact with the brain. Establish a new communication and control channel with external devices, which has the effect of monitoring, replacing, improving/restoring damaged or impaired natural central nervous system output and input. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a multidisciplinary cutting-edge technology that can not only assist in the diagnosis and treatment of some neurological diseases, partially or fully realize the compensation of certain human body functions, and is even expected to cure some mental diseases. Medical care is considered to be its most promising field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are three main implementation methods of brain-computer interface, non-invasive, invasive and vascular intervention. The non-invasive brain-computer interface mainly refers to the collection of EEG signals in the cerebral cortex without surgery; the invasive type requires implanting electrodes deep into the brain, requiring surgeries such as craniotomy and bone drilling; the vascular interventional type mainly involves the electrode holder. Implanted into the corresponding inner wall of blood vessels to collect EEG signals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, most research on brain-computer interfaces is in the basic research stage, and some clinical results have also been achieved. In June 2022, researchers at Johns Hopkins University completed the world&#39;s first human trial of a bilaterally implanted brain-computer interface. A subject who had been paralyzed for 30 years successfully controlled machinery through EEG signals, completing Deliver cakes and eat independently; in China, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital launched brain-computer interface and deep brain stimulation methods in 2020 to treat refractory depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the participation of star companies such as Meta and Neuralink owned by &quot;Silicon Valley Iron Man&quot; Elon Musk, attention on brain-computer interfaces has been unprecedentedly high in recent years, and Duan Feng will also establish it in 2023 The company is trying to transform the results of brain-computer interface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, since he returned to China after studying in Japan in 2009, he has been on the road of &quot;integration of industry, academia and research&quot; by focusing on teaching and research on one hand and entrepreneurship on the other. For this reason, he often stumbled. &quot;1 billion in 10 years, whether to do it or not&quot; has become his &quot;touchstone&quot; to test whether investors are sincere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is Southern Weekend’s interview with Duan Feng:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Want to build an “industry-university-research integration” platform&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From an academic background, you received a bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degree from the School of Mechanical Engineering of Tianjin University, and studied precision mechanical engineering at the University of Tokyo, Japan, and received a master&#39;s and doctoral degree. degree, and chose medical rehabilitation equipment to start a business. Is it because you have always been interested in machinery? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng:&lt;/strong>; When I took the college entrance examination in 1998, the major I wanted to study most was actually electronics. I filled out the application form and was transferred to the School of Mechanical Engineering of Tianjin University, where I majored in internal combustion engines and obtained postgraduate qualifications in my senior year. Studying in Japan is also an accidental choice. During my master&#39;s degree, my supervisor sent me to cooperate with two engine companies. At that time, the machinery industry was in recession, and one company went bankrupt. It was very embarrassing. At that time, I thought about changing careers and prepared to study abroad. It happened that the University of Tokyo in Japan not only waived the application fee, but also provided scholarships, round-trip air tickets and accommodation. The conditions were very good, so I chose precision manufacturing related to machinery among the majors they admitted. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you later turn to brain-computer interface? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng:&lt;/strong>;I have studied intelligent service robots and unitized flexible production lines in Japan. My professional field has shifted from power machinery to robot control, and further Go to brain-computer interfaces. I first heard about the concept of brain-computer interface in a lecture at the University of Tokyo. I thought it was very interesting at the time, but I had limited energy and could not study it in depth. The biggest reason is that I want to copy Japan’s “industry-university-research” model in China. When I was studying in Japan, I encountered many companies that came to colleges and universities to invite students to dinner to identify talents, provide scholarships to students, and provide funds for scientific research projects to teachers to achieve the integration of &quot;industry, academia, and research.&quot; At that time, this model was relatively common in China. Rare. After graduation, I returned to China and entered Nankai University. After completing my teaching tasks, I could delve into the fields I was interested in, and then started to build a company to industrialize the research results. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you start your business at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;I learned about the market while teaching at the university. Specifically, it is to find companies to cooperate to develop things that are urgently needed by the market but there is still half a step in technology development. At that time, a friend introduced some assistive device products in cooperation with small medical device companies, which are types that rely on external force to move the limbs, but they are not independent movements. I hope to make devices that can be independently controlled by people to drive body movements, but I don’t want to sell products because it requires a series of issues such as device registration, quality inspection, and commercial promotion, so I anchored the technology research and development on the front end of the product. When I first returned to China, my monthly salary was only 3,800 yuan. After deducting 2,000 yuan for rent and 1,500 yuan for my children’s kindergarten tuition, I only had 300 yuan for living expenses every month. I think most entrepreneurs should have more money than me. Because I had no money, I had always pinned my hopes of raising money on finding partners or investors, so I took many detours and went through a process of company registration, cancellation, re-registration, and cancellation again. Many times it was dismantled. There was a difficult period when the east wall was repairing the west wall. At first, I considered making some small rehabilitation electrical stimulation equipment. A company talked to me about cooperation and asked me to do front-end research and development. It claimed that after the product was launched, the company would have its own sales channels. I believed it, but after finishing it, I found that this was not the case. Damn, there&#39;s nothing behind it. Some companies also asked me to invest in technology and promised equity. As a result, we advanced money, spent time, and invested a lot of energy. After the technology was formed, the &quot;partner&quot; ran away. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How to solve the entrepreneurial start-up fund? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;I earned it by selling technology. It is to help companies develop what they need and then sell it for money. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Experiencing these things, the impact on you is What? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng:&lt;/strong>;I am also reflecting and summarizing. Whether I am doing scientific research or doing industry, I just ask myself whether this is the case. If you really want to do what you want to do without anyone&#39;s help, then just do it. When I did not place my hopes on others and relied on my own efforts and persistence to do what I wanted to do, many people who helped me came to me on their own initiative. Some brought money, some brought resources, Others brought some new concepts and ideas, and gradually the matter became a success. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Among the people who took the initiative to find &quot; Liar&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When you have experienced some &quot;stepping into pitfalls&quot;, it will be easier to evaluate people&#39;s risks. Now come and talk to me. Yes, you can tell whether it is suitable or not in just a few minutes. I will not accept investment from others casually now. When someone comes to talk to me, I usually ask a question, &quot;1 billion in 10 years, do you want to do it?&quot; If you don&#39;t want to, then don&#39;t waste each other&#39;s time. In my case, if it works, it works, if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. There is no middle ground. This 1 billion is not just a thought, it is a scientific estimate. I do vascular interventional brain-computer interface experiments. Each electrode is ground out bit by bit by hand. It takes 10 days of grinding 24 hours a day to make one. The cost of consumables, labor costs, etc. in these 10 days add up. The total cost is at least 100,000 yuan; another example is the large animal monkey used for experiments. It costs 200,000 yuan to buy a monkey and 300 yuan to raise it for a day. This cost is very high. &quot;1 billion in 10 years&quot; is only used to test whether investors have the patience and sincerity to accompany the product&#39;s growth. It does not mean that someone must spend 1 billion. If the other party does not have a basic understanding of how much time it will take, how much money it will cost, and the possible return on investment, and they come and say that they are familiar with people from a certain local government and have connections in a certain park, they will talk about it with boastful words, or they will start talking about equity without saying anything. , we need to do due diligence, these are not the partners we would choose. We prefer to cooperate with people who have feelings and ideals. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;No matter whether it is intrusive or non-intrusive, I am not optimistic about it&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Research on brain-computer interfaces has been very hot in recent years. What are the pros and cons of invasive and non-invasive brain-computer interfaces? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Non-invasive brain-computer interface is relatively safe because it is non-invasive. It mainly collects nerve discharge signals that converge on the surface of the scalp. Since this signal collection must pass through the skull and layers of tissue cells, and there are many interference signals in the scalp, the collected EEG signals are not very stable. The action EEG signal is okay, but over time, or when it recognizes finer movements, it won&#39;t work. Invasive brain-computer interfaces implant electrodes into the brain by opening the skull. If you want to collect a certain signal, you need to implant electrodes into the corresponding brain area. Usually, within half a year, the signals collected through the invasive brain-computer interface are more accurate, and the effect of human-computer interaction is also better, such as controlling the robotic arm to grab objects, and the degree of completion is also relatively high. But it’s hard to tell after half a year, because the electrodes are harmful to the brain, may lead to rejection and suppuration, scar tissue can easily accumulate around the electrodes, and the circuits will also generate a certain amount of heat, which can easily cause inflammation, which is harmful to the human body. The damage is also relatively large. Therefore, its sustainability is very poor, and the EEG signals collected later will become weaker, or even no signals can be collected. This is also a fatal shortcoming of invasive brain-computer interfaces. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In September 2023, Neuralink’s invasive brain The machine interface has begun recruiting human clinical trial subjects. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The intrusive approach will cause great harm, but there are still many companies to deal with. What is a person? Are they silicon-based organisms or carbon-based organisms? What are these electrode materials? People and these materials are fundamentally incompatible. I did an invasive brain-computer interface on mice, and all the mice died. The monkeys in Musk&#39;s previous experiments also died. This direction is problematic in terms of long-term safety. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why are you doing this &quot;world&#39;s first African &quot;Human primate (monkey) interventional brain-computer interface trial&quot;? How were the animal types selected and what was the testing process? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;The trial&lt;span>; will be carried out starting in June 2022. It was originally to verify the feasibility of the interventional brain-computer interface. Although there have been some relevant reports internationally, whether they are true or false cannot be known until verification. In terms of details, such as verifying whether the sensor works and whether it can last for more than half a year in the animal&#39;s brain. For vascular interventional brain-computer interfaces, the blood vessels of animals that are too small, such as mice, are too thin for electrode wires to enter. Although the blood vessels of sheep are thinner than humans, they are relatively thick, and the price is also cheap. Basic movements can be distinguished. Come out; after the experiment is successful, we will test the monkey again, and let the monkey&#39;s active intention control the mechanical arm to grab food. Because monkeys are a species similar to humans, there will be no problem with it. Then we will feel more at ease when we do human experiments. . The overall process is rather tortuous. Finding partners and venues such as hospitals and laboratories is not a problem, because everyone knows that this is a very new research, and it will be easy to publish papers and get projects later, and it also has certain market prospects. The difficulty is that the early stage of this experiment was during the epidemic. Many engineers and students were often blocked and needed to find various ways to coordinate personnel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In January this year, the American Synchron company announced its The &quot;vascular interventional&quot; brain-computer interface clinical trial successfully allowed four paralyzed subjects to control external devices and complete operations such as texting and emailing, personal finance, and online shopping. How do you understand some media describing your research as &quot;creating the third new paradigm of brain-computer interface&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is recommended not to interpret it out of context. This &quot;pioneering&quot; and &quot;world&#39;s first&quot; should be viewed together. When I conduct experiments on sheep, I actually mean to create the third new paradigm of brain-computer interface in China, because no one in China has done relevant research; the world&#39;s first case means that I am the first person in the world to conduct experiments on monkey species. People who do this type of experiment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After the success of this experiment, we will bring you What are the impacts? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From a mental point of view, it has no impact at all. I think it is very dull. According to our plan, this trial will soon enter the clinical stage, that is, it will be tested on humans, but it is still in the ethical review stage of the hospital. But I do get some emails from volunteers. What impressed me deeply was that there was a woman who wanted to save her husband who was lying in the ICU and hoped that her husband could participate in the clinical trial of brain-computer interface; there was also a grandson who wanted to save his grandmother, and the child wanted to be a volunteer; there was also a blind person Ask me to regain my sight... These letters are very touching, but our experimental ethics have not yet passed and we cannot recruit any subjects. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Some scholars believe that &quot;the development of brain-computer interface We are currently in a bottleneck period, and there is an urgent need for new principles and new technologies to drive research in related fields into the next period of rapid development.&quot; What do you think? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The current research on brain-computer interface technology is indeed in a bottleneck period. There are many problems about brain-computer interface. Global problems are not unique to China. Whether it is a non-invasive or invasive track, there are too many players. If they could achieve results, they would have been done long ago. There are too many smart people and many wealthy capital parties. At present, everyone is in a state of relative stagnation. To some extent, it shows that there is a problem with this road, and I suggest you consider changing the track. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Change track? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Whether it is invasive or non-invasive, I am not optimistic about it, because I have done it, and there are many domestic companies or institutions. Did. In China, the current focus of the industry is still non-invasive. Everyone is crowded onto this track and there is a traffic jam. But I don’t follow any industry. I am currently focusing on vascular interventional brain-computer interface technology. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;I hope more people can do research in a down-to-earth manner&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;Many people are currently focusing on the industrialization of brain-computer interfaces in rehabilitation medicine. Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is a huge demand for patients in this field and the number of patients is also large. With some auxiliary equipment, partial or complete disablement of limbs can be achieved. Sports, so the market potential is relatively large. In addition, the technical process is not difficult, and some low-threshold products are relatively easy to make. As long as companies can raise funds and obtain corresponding certifications and licenses, they can quickly realize cash. If product prices drop further in the future, for example, a product worth 100,000 yuan becomes 20,000 yuan, then the demand will be even higher. There are two main chains in rehabilitation medicine, one is the innovation chain, and the other is the industrial chain. The industrial chain is to make high-end technologies low-end and turn them into products that are sinking. After sinking, they can be universally applicable to more people. After they are universally applicable to more people, there will be more data in scientific research, and there will be more After the data is collected, it is fed back to the innovation chain to form better technology and better products. What I am currently building is such a double-chain circulation platform. Therefore, we did not rush to make specific products, but calmed down and started working on the electrodes. After the electrode automation is completed, it can serve many products. My entrepreneurship was a relatively stupid situation, equivalent to begging for food with a golden rice bowl. The position I give myself is not to do specific, low-end, repetitive things, but to make the company a platform and a core system for brain-computer interface applications in rehabilitation medicine. This platform will also be open in the future. , allowing more people, companies, and institutions to do things together on this platform. As long as they don&#39;t fool me and want to do things down-to-earth, they are all welcome. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The current overall ecology of China&#39;s brain-computer interface industrialization What is it like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the concept of brain-computer interface is overheated at this stage, and some irresponsible media use gimmicks to gain attention. Change the concept. For example, the flashing pictures are actually brain electrical signals induced by vision, which is a conditioned response. However, in media reports, it is described as controlled by &quot;thoughts&quot;. It seems very fantasy, but it is actually very simple. As far as brain-computer interface companies are concerned, there are actually not many people who can really endure loneliness and do low-level R&amp;D, because low-level R&amp;D is too expensive and there is no cash return in the short term. I sincerely hope that more people in the industry are willing to do basic research in a down-to-earth manner. Today’s investors don’t blindly follow investments because they don’t have much money. Maybe because there are so many people speculating on concepts, there are not many people who really have the patience to accompany the growth of innovative companies. I am not willing to accept investment from such investors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In your opinion, the domestic brain-computer interface corresponds to In product development, what are the urgent problems that need to be solved? What type of talent is most in short supply? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the ideal brain-computer interface product in the future should be realized through vascular intervention. In order to achieve this goal, it is urgently needed Solve the problem of electrode stability. After the stability is guaranteed, we can then find ways to realize automated production to reduce the cost of the product. Judging from the professional fields involved in talents, more cross-field and compound talents are needed. For example, there is overlap in at least two or more fields in materials, processing, machinery, circuits, medicine and other fields. The most important thing is that these people can calm down and do things in a down-to-earth manner. They will not go to this company where the salary is high today, or to make money in that field tomorrow. People without feelings cannot do good things. Under this premise, you must have good understanding and the ability to think independently and explore. Both are important. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to brain-computer interface, you have other research Simultaneously? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Duan Feng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We are currently also developing intelligent aircraft that can take off vertically and artificial hibernation of rats. In the future, we hope that artificial hibernation experiments can be combined with interventional brain-computer interfaces to use special stimulation signals through electrodes in blood vessels to affect the entire brain, or to modify the brain in this way to make people hibernate. This technology can be used in the future It is used in some medical treatment fields. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[风波过后，脱口秀行业复苏在望？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261442]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4 data-style=&quot;margin: 16px; outline: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant -east-asian: normal; letter-spacing: 0.544px; white-space: normal; font-family: -apple-system-font, BlinkMacSystemFont, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PingFang SC&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hiragino Sans GB&amp;quot ;, &amp;quot;Microsoft YaHei UI&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Microsoft YaHei&amp;quot;, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 27.2px; widows: 1; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); visibility: visible; text -align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span data-style=&quot;color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: &amp;quot;PingFang SC&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hiragino Sans GB&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Microsoft YaHei&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 18px;&quot;>;Open mic performance Sharp decline&amp;nbsp;Actors are looking for other opportunities&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p data-style=&quot;margin: 16px; outline: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian : normal; letter-spacing: 0.544px; white-space: normal; font-family: -apple-system-font, BlinkMacSystemFont, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PingFang SC&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hiragino Sans GB&amp;quot;, &amp;quot; Microsoft YaHei UI&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Microsoft YaHei&amp;quot;, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 27.2px; widows: 1; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); visibility: visible;&quot;>;&lt;span>; In May of this year, the talk show industry went through a series of rectifications.

Actors must perform performances strictly in accordance with the approved content. If there is any discrepancy between the performance video and the submitted content, the performance organization will be fined 50,000-100,000 yuan. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p data-style=&quot;margin: 16px; outline: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; letter-spacing: 0.544px; white- space: normal; font-family: -apple-system-font, BlinkMacSystemFont, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PingFang SC&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hiragino Sans GB&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Microsoft YaHei UI&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Microsoft YaHei&amp;quot;, Arial , sans-serif; line-height: 27.2px; widows: 1; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); visibility: visible;&quot;>;&lt;span>;This has led to two changes in Shanghai talk show performances.

Due to factors such as actors&#39; personal creative habits and time, the content and lineup of open mic performances are somewhat uncontrollable. It is common for actors to temporarily revise and adjust new jokes before going on stage or to be unable to go on stage due to unexpected circumstances and need to be replaced by other actors. Therefore, under the current cautious environment, most talk show clubs in Shanghai no longer hold such forms of talk show performances. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p data-style=&quot;margin: 16px; outline: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; letter-spacing: 0.544px; white- space: normal; font-family: -apple-system-font, BlinkMacSystemFont, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PingFang SC&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hiragino Sans GB&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Microsoft YaHei UI&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Microsoft YaHei&amp;quot;, Arial , sans-serif; line-height: 27.2px; widows: 1; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); visibility: visible;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Shanghai open mic performances dropped sharply, resulting in no new actors on stage Chances are, veteran actors are unable to update their creative content. Some full-time actors will choose to go to open mics in other cities to try out new jokes, and Hangzhou has become their first choice. &quot;Xie Haihan&quot;, the manager of Ersansan Talk Show Club, told reporters that four or five contracted actors in his club have chosen to develop in Hangzhou. Currently, there are at least 10 talk show clubs in Hangzhou. But this does not mean that actors can make money in Hangzhou, but that they are more &quot;famous&quot; in Hangzhou. &quot;Everyone is willing to go to Hangzhou, mostly because of the open mic.

I came to &quot;chasing stars&quot; after watching online programs, but I don&#39;t know much about comedy itself.

Now if his jokes are lower than 60 or 70 points, your performance will be very few, and many people will no longer be able to get performances. In the past two years, everyone If you are all in the limelight, there will be no survival of the fittest.
