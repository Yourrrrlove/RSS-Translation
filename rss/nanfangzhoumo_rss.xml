She graduated from a rural school in Jianghan Plain and studied all the way to get a doctorate. However, when she returned to her hometown, she heard that the school was no longer what it used to be. Students were fighting and the enrollment rate was declining. The junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and wiped in the back of the classroom. tears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Lei Wanghong visited county schools in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Gansu, Henan and other regions, and she found that this phenomenon was not a special case. She noticed that some drastic changes were taking place at the end of basic education, and these changes at the end were silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the wave of urbanization in education, rural students are pouring into counties, and what is left in villages and towns are often children who cannot afford to go to cities to study. Some of them do not like to study, are disobedient to discipline, and are almost self-indulgent. Giving up, the teacher also has a headache, and both parties are in confusion with no way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lei Wanghong believes that for county-level governments, the main goal of education urbanization is regional development, that is, by attracting rural students to study in cities and driving rural people to buy houses and consume in cities, thereby promoting land The closed fiscal cycle ultimately promotes regional economic development. However, from a practical point of view, the introduction of education into cities has not greatly stimulated local economic development as expected, but has resulted in some students being left behind in villages and towns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She found that counties in central and western provinces and eastern provinces have different development paths in the process of promoting urbanization of education: public and private education are more balanced in the eastern region, while private education in the central and western regions is relatively stronger. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there such regional differences? Educational urbanization has experienced at least ten years of development. How effective is it? Under this wave, what should the remaining children do? Lei Wanghong is now a lecturer at the School of Public Administration of Central South University. She was interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters on related issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The economic foundation determines the development path of county education&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you pay attention to county education issues at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>; Once when I returned to my hometown, a neighbor kid told me that my junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and was wiping tears behind the classroom. When I was studying, she was very majestic, and I respected her very much. This contrast was shocking. In addition, the situation in my hometown has not been very good for higher education in recent years, and there has been a fierce discussion in society about the uneven distribution of educational resources. At that time, our team had been studying grassroots governance, and no one had studied grassroots education issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After May 2017, I went to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi and Guizhou and other places to investigate different villages, townships and counties. The education situation of various school stages in the space, and understanding the development of government education, students&#39; family situations, and school social evaluation, the overall research perspective of county education gradually emerged. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Eastern and central and western regions, in county education What problems do each face during development? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The eastern region has sufficient educational resources and capable parents. They generally form better home-school cooperation with schools, but competition in education It is very fierce. For example, the Hangzhou Family Committee election was reported in the news before. In order to give their children more performance opportunities, parents will engage in fierce PK. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important problem in the central and western regions is intergenerational separation. Parents will also follow the trend and adopt some self-help behaviors, such as &quot;accompanying students&quot;. The phenomenon of accompanying students in Gansu, Shaanxi, Anhui, and Hubei is very universal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you found any similarities in the education situation in different regions? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One similarity is the urbanization of education. To put it simply, the improvement of the quality of schools in the city will attract students to study in the city, which in turn will encourage more families to buy houses in the city, thereby revitalizing land finance and regional development. But there are some differences between the eastern region and the central and western regions. The former&#39;s education urbanization is more of a natural urbanization. Parents move to cities to work, live and take their children to receive education because there are job opportunities in the city. The latter&#39;s education urbanization is driven by local governments, because rural areas The supply of school education is too poor, and local governments have invested more resources in urban schools, thus forcing people to send their children to urban schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, I went to a developed county in Zhejiang for research. Basically, all the local village primary schools were withdrawn and concentrated on running schools in towns and villages. Township schools are well-equipped and beautifully built, and their teachers are of high standard, many of whom are admitted from other places. However, due to the urbanization of education, rural children have gone to cities to study, and those who are left behind are children with poor family conditions who do not like to study and are not easy to manage, which is a headache for teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I found that this phenomenon is very common. The end of the eastern region is at the township level, and the end of the central and western regions is at the village level. Being at such an end, unable to provide students with enough educational hope, teachers are also in pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The development logic of education urbanization in the eastern and central and western regions is the same ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Due to different economic bases, the eastern region and the central and western regions have very different spatial distribution. The eastern region has a developed economy and strong education supply capacity, and the quality of public education in various urban and rural areas of the county can be guaranteed. The eastern region has developed industries and large employment opportunities. Parents go to the cities to find jobs, and their children also go to the cities to study. Families can buy houses and live in the cities. Its urbanization is a natural urbanization in which education and production are synchronized. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large number of counties in the central and western regions have not yet established local finances that allow local governments to obtain sufficient financial resources. They are unable to ensure the balanced development of urban and rural education and provide employment for local migrant workers returning home. There is also very little space. Young people from peasant families can only go to the eastern cities to work and earn money. Because they cannot afford the high cost of education in developed areas, the children can only stay in their hometowns to go to school and be taken care of by their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1706&quot; height= &quot;1278&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250888&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 2023, Lei Wanghong and his team conducted research in a certain county. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Public education needs to respond to social needs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since at least ten years ago, there have been many views that urbanization of education is a &quot;green engine&quot;. You What is the entry point for research on educational urbanization? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, I was mainly stimulated by two things. First, many people in the academic community regard urbanization of education as a positive behavior. However, during the actual research process, I found that there are many problems in urbanization of education. Everyone’s educational anxiety is very serious, and many families bear an excessive educational burden. Education, medical care, and housing have become the new &quot;three mountains.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other thing is that I was deeply inspired after reading the doctoral thesis &quot;Children of Urbanization&quot; by Professor Xiong Yihan of Fudan University. The phenomenon we are concerned about is very similar - can rural children share the blue sky of education with urban children after entering the city? In fact, rural children are easily marginalized when they move to cities. For example, teachers in the city will mention that rural children have stereotypes such as being unhygienic and unruly. The campus culture of urban schools will make rural children feel inferior to a certain extent; rural children rarely have access to class power. structure, because teachers are more likely to accept children who are influenced by urban culture and form effective communication and interaction with them. When I held discussions with urban and rural students, I also found that urban students have stronger expressive skills and are good at showing themselves, while rural students are introverted. When they want to speak, they will inadvertently look at urban students for fear of saying something wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To promote the urbanization of education, local governments must build new schools in counties and open Between public and private schools, which option do most counties prefer? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The government is more willing to build public schools. Because there are difficulties in the management of private schools, they can charge fees independently, use enrollment policies flexibly, and attract high-quality students through benefits. After the results of the high school and high school entrance exams are obtained, these students become the &quot;living signs&quot; of the school&#39;s publicity. Teachers will further gather in private schools, putting local public schools in a weak position and affecting the local education ecology to a certain extent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But in fact, the central and western regions will still choose to introduce it Private school, why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because the local finances of some counties in the central and western regions are not enough to support the development of public education. On the one hand, the local government has the task of attracting investment, and on the other hand, it has to ensure the supply of education and is under multiple pressures. Private schools in some areas are introduced through investment promotion. The local government has not only completed the corresponding investment quotas, but also alleviated the pressure on local degree supply. At the same time, the outstanding students cultivated by private schools can also be counted as the educational achievements of local governments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why do parents prefer private schools? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The main reason is that many public schools have not responded to parents’ educational demands. This year I went to a township junior high school in a central province for research and found that the student cafeteria was not equipped with tables and chairs, and students squatted at the top of the stairs to eat. Some schools arrange for students to live in houses that were built 20 or 30 years ago, and the walls of the dormitories fall off from time to time. In 2021, I met a driver during my research. He said that both of his children were studying in private schools, which cost 60,000 yuan a year. The couple&#39;s salary was only enough to cover the expenses of the children, and their life was very stressful. I asked him if he would be willing to go to a public school if it could provide relatively good room and board services, but it would cost an extra thousand yuan per semester. He said he would definitely do it. This is also the sentiment of most parents. Only when the government finds a way to truly respond to the demands of the people will students slowly return to private schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/eXR0y4KyX2vVuA7IczOqzh7qbbrpC1EV7FohbnJB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/eXR0y4KyX2vVuA7IczOqzh7qbbrpC1EV7FohbnJB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250889&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 11, 2020, a newly built primary school was put into operation in Suining County, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Respect the laws of natural flow&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After research, what problems have you found that urbanization in education may bring about? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first is debt risk. Some local governments use education as the starting point to promote education to revitalize the city and invest a large amount of money in a short period of time. New schools were built, leading to serious debt. Recently I heard that a county in a central province is spending huge sums of money to build a school. Many counties in the survey have huge debts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the maintenance cost of schools is very high. Some local governments build schools to the highest standards ahead of schedule, leaving a large amount of space idle, resulting in very high school operating costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, farmers have a heavy education burden. When building primary and secondary schools in some places, they only focus on pure education issues and do not consider the overall social division of labor. Some newly built schools in urban areas are not equipped with dormitories and canteens. Rural parents who send their children to the city still need to rent or buy a house in the city to accompany them to school. They cannot Parents who take care of their children leave their children to child care institutions. For example, the child care institutions in Guangxi are particularly developed now. The child care institutions not only take care of students&#39; lives, but also take care of after-school learning. Whether it is renting or buying a house to accompany students to study, or hosting, it has greatly increased the financial burden of education on farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is the adaptation problem of rural students just mentioned. A new dual structure of urban and rural education has essentially been formed in urban schools. The family background and family knowledge ability of rural students may not necessarily support them in the city. receive a fair education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since there are so many problems, why are the grassroots in the central and western provinces still there? Promote education urbanization? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In addition to facilitating management, the county government is also trying to activate local land finance through education urbanization. By vigorously developing education in county towns, farmers can move to cities to buy houses. Local governments can promote the return of capital, population agglomeration, and the formation of a chain to activate the county economy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are these efforts effective? I saw that in the three central and western counties you visited for your doctoral thesis, housing prices did not rise in the end. Why is this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, farmers are not very motivated to buy houses in cities. In 2014, the house price in a county in Gansu was 4,000 yuan/square meter. But when I went to the county for research in 2017, house prices were still hovering around 4,000 yuan. Even so, the house still couldn&#39;t be sold. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to the development of county education lies in the county economy. The fundamental reason why farmers are not enthusiastic about buying houses in cities is that the cities lack an industrial foundation that can support them to maintain their family life. If migrant workers can only work as construction workers, waiters, etc. in the county, their income level is not enough to support them to buy a house and settle down in the county. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is educational urbanization a local development path worthy of recognition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The urbanization of education is an inevitable trend, but there are differences in speed. What we are criticizing is the phenomenon of using education as the starting point to promote urban development through education. Educational urbanization must be promoted at a reasonable speed. On the one hand, the natural flow laws must be respected. People who have the ability to go to the city and want to go to the city must respect their choices. At the same time, we must also see the impact of human factors promoting education urbanization. Problems such as incoming debt, high maintenance costs, and difficulty for students to adapt. At the current stage, a more appropriate way is to build good township schools and give students who cannot afford to go to the city a certain space for educational development. Children who study in this space can hope to enter high school and college, which will improve the mobility of the entire social class. Only by maintaining smooth flow can there be hope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Huang Xiaoying also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打破出身论？上海民办高校毕业生可报考选调生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256922]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/lF7PAVJ2SvAM8WPULb51S2fKME0OfGlO9eMe4ayu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1123&quot; height=&quot;748&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/lF7PAVJ2SvAM8WPULb51S2fKME0OfGlO9 eMe4ayu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251072&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 20, 2022, Wuhan, candidates took the 2022 Hubei Provincial Selection Examination . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Graduates from private colleges and universities who were once exclusively admitted to prestigious public schools can also apply. On September 1, 2023, the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee issued an announcement for the selection of outstanding university graduates in 2024. Students from 7 private universities in the city were included in the selection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Selected students are fresh graduates recruited by the organizational department on the basis of merit from colleges and universities. They are divided into targeted and non-targeted. There are special requirements for recruitment such as political profile, scholarships, and student cadre experience. Among them, the requirements for targeted selection are more stringent and are mainly targeted at key domestic universities or key majors in some universities, while the minimum requirements for non-directional selection are generally from ordinary public undergraduate colleges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the landscape of tune selection is changing. According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, in addition to Shanghai, some graduates from private colleges and universities in Hunan and Fujian are also eligible to apply for selection. In addition, in 10 provinces including Sichuan, Shanxi, and Guangdong, the application scope has also been expanded to foreign (overseas) universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the scale of selected students is also expanding, which is related to local employment stabilization policies. In July 2023, among the measures to stabilize employment issued by the Shanghai Employment Leading Group, it was mentioned that the scale of selection should be gradually expanded and the selection and recruitment of outstanding recent university graduates should be &quot;continuously implemented.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The most important thing is not to judge heroes by their school background.” A person close to the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The scope is expanded and the threshold is also raised&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the aforementioned announcement issued by the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, students from four types of universities can apply for transfer: Peking University 44 colleges and universities without restriction on majors, 30 colleges and universities with restricted majors such as Central University of Finance and Economics, 29 universities in the city including East China University of Political Science and Law, and new pilot colleges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Private universities are included in the third category of &quot;29 local universities&quot;, with a total of 7 universities, namely Shanghai Sanda College, Shanghai Institute of Visual Arts, Shanghai International Studies University Xianda College of Economics and Humanities, Shanghai Jianqiao College, Shanghai Normal University Tianhua College, Shanghai Xingwei College, Shanghai Lida College. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of these schools were upgraded from junior colleges to undergraduates. Among them, Shanghai Lida College was the latest to upgrade and did not start recruiting undergraduates until 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting graduates from private colleges and universities did not start in 2023. Southern Weekend reporters found that this policy has been implemented as early as 2021. Previously, Shanghai only recruited graduates from 15 universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Renmin University of China, of which nine were from the city&#39;s 985 and 211 universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from 2021, Shanghai will relax restrictions on universities and include 30 local universities on the list, including the aforementioned 7 private universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an important way to supplement grassroots party and government leading cadres, the selection and transfer system has been to select the best from the best since its inception. In 1965, the Ministry of Education assigned some college graduates to work in rural areas, and the selective transfer system began. In the late 1970s, this system was gradually implemented in various provinces, and the selection targets were mainly undergraduate graduates with strong party spirit and excellent academic performance in universities. In order to solve the problem of the lack of highly educated talents among grassroots cadres, in 2009, Chongqing launched the first targeted selection system for Qingbei and other 985 universities, kicking off the targeted selection to famous universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that the current targeted recruitment announcements issued by some provinces also specifically indicate that the recruitment scope does not include independent colleges and private universities. However, some provinces have expanded the scope of selective transfer to private schools. From a national perspective, graduates from some private universities in Fujian and Hunan can also apply for selective transfer. Fujian once adopted the method of quota allocation, allocating the points for selection to private universities in the province such as Yang&#39;en University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope has expanded and the application threshold has also increased. Taking Shanghai as an example, not all graduates from the colleges and universities on the list are eligible to apply. In addition to age and academic performance requirements, they must also meet at least one &quot;other condition&quot;, including being a member of the Communist Party of China (including probationary members) and serving as a member of the Communist Party of China for more than one year. Secretary of the Youth League Committee of the school or department and other related positions, and won the honorary title or scholarship of outstanding or three good students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the above-mentioned third category of local universities including private schools, they need to meet the conditions of receiving a national scholarship or a Shanghai scholarship, and serving as the secretary of the youth league committee of the school or department for more than one year and other related positions. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hunan Province’s 2023 student selection examination, there will no longer be a distinction between ordinary and targeted selection, and there will no longer be a limit on the positions that graduates of “double first-class” and non-”double first-class” schools can apply for, but candidates All must meet the requirements for (preparatory) party members and student cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Overseas universities are included in the selection scope&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that this time, the Shanghai selection is the first time that the top 50 universities in the world are included in the fourth category of pilot universities. For overseas college graduates, the score line will be separately determined by the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, as of September 2023, there are 10 provinces that have made it clear that they will recruit graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope of schools defined by most provinces is based on the top 100 QS World University Rankings, and candidates are required to have a master&#39;s degree or a doctorate degree or above. Some provinces have restrictions on undergraduate qualifications. For example, Hebei Province requires candidates to obtain a degree from a domestic undergraduate university that is included in the selection scope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regulations vary from place to place as to whether international students are members of the Communist Party of China or whether they have received scholarships. For example, Guangdong and Shanxi have no mandatory requirements and only indicate in the announcement that those who meet the requirements will be given priority for transfer. Beijing requires international students to meet one of the following three conditions: Chinese Communist Party (preparatory) party members, three good students and other honorary titles (obtained during the highest academic qualifications) ), with experience in joining the military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the difficulty of work in organizational departments, it may be more difficult to include graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities in the selection scope. In December 2022, some netizens left a message on the leadership message board of People&#39;s Daily Online, suggesting that Fujian include outstanding graduates from foreign schools in the selection examination. The Organization Department of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee replied, &quot;Because it is impossible to go to the school to conduct in-depth on-site inspections of the candidates and make inspection conclusions, overseas universities have not been included in the selection scope.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the selection of foreign (overseas) candidates, Sichuan recruits a large number of college graduates, and it is also the first province to take advantage of this. As early as 2015, the province issued separate relevant policies for graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities, and recruited a total of 24 graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities in the first batch, including 5 Ph.D. In 2023, among the targeted selected students in Sichuan, the number of graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities will reach 82, which is three times the number in 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, among the first batch of 24 graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities recruited by Sichuan in 2015, 4 have currently reached full-time majors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Only one or two a year”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why is the scope of selected students constantly expanding? &quot;The reason for including private colleges and universities is that, in addition to taking care of the tendency of the city&#39;s colleges and universities, the most important thing is not to judge heroes based on their school background.&quot; A person close to the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee told the Southern Weekend reporter that candidates reported by colleges and universities will be included in the merit review. They are assigned to responsible cadres and weighted assessments are conducted based on the students&#39; basic conditions, such as awards and other indicators, and are &quot;not linked to the school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as early as May 21, 2018, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a symposium on motivating cadres to take on new responsibilities and new actions in the new era and strengthening and improving the selection and transfer of students. It mentioned that &quot;highlighting political standards, appropriate Expand the scale and accurately select classifications and classifications.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the expansion of the scope of selected students in various places also has the consideration of stabilizing employment. In the aforementioned &quot;Several Measures to Optimize and Adjust Employment Stabilization Policies to Promote Development and Benefit People&#39;s Livelihood&quot; issued by the Shanghai Employment Leading Group in July 2023, it was proposed to &quot;gradually expand the scale of selection and transfer.&quot; In 2023, Chongqing announced that the number of non-directed transfers will reach 600, an increase of 50% compared with 400 the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the scope is expanded, will more graduates from private colleges and universities enter the selection sequence? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff at the employment offices of Shanghai Jianqiao College and Shanghai Sanda College told Southern Weekend reporters that “no one has been admitted to Shanghai’s selective transfer program in recent years.” A staff member from the Xianda School of Humanities and Economics at Shanghai International Studies University revealed, “There are only one or two a year.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff of Shanghai Sanda College believes that although it is possible to take the exam, &quot;it is really difficult, and scholarships, class cadres (and other requirements) must be met.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned person close to the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee said that during the examination process, the overall expressive ability of students from prestigious universities was better than that of ordinary private universities. &quot;The final admission results are in a normal distribution. Graduates from Qingbei and Renmin University More, other universities have less.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大股东违规减持被重罚：股市不能成为“韭菜收割机”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256916]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 16:15:33&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On Friday, September 15, 2023, after the stock market closed, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced: Nanjing I The major shareholder of Le Home Co., Ltd. (Wo Le Home) imposed heavy penalties. On the same day, another listed company, Oriental Fashion, announced that its chairman and actual controller had been arrested on suspicion of manipulating the securities market. Shareholders of the two companies who illegally reduced their holdings were severely fined, which shows that the regulatory authorities are serious about illegal reductions and other behaviors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission website reported on September 15 that Yu Fanyi, the major shareholder who holds 7.11% of the equity of Wole Home, and his concerted parties have illegally reduced their holdings of Wole Home shares, and they plan to confiscate them in accordance with the law. Those acting in concert had illegal gains of 16.53 million yuan and were severely fined 32.95 million yuan, with a total fine of 49.48 million yuan. According to the report, Yu Fanyi and his concerted parties failed to fulfill their information disclosure obligations in accordance with the law when they purchased 5% of Wole Home&#39;s shares through the secondary market in 2021 and were warned. This time, Yu Fanyi and others reduced all 7.11% of their stock holdings on September 5 and 6, 2023, once again violating the regulations that should be announced when the change in shareholding ratio reaches 5% and must not be announced within 3 days. Rules for buying and selling the stock again. In response, the China Securities Regulatory Commission decided to impose heavy penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Securities Law stipulates a number of special provisions for shareholders who hold (including jointly held through persons acting in concert) more than 5% of the shares of a listed company when buying and selling stocks: when the shareholding reaches 5%, the stock purchase and sale period shall be within 3 days. A written report shall be made to the Securities Regulatory Commission and the stock exchange, and the listed company shall be notified to make an announcement. During this period, the listed company&#39;s stocks shall not be traded again; thereafter, a report and announcement shall be made for every increase or decrease of 5%, and no further purchases shall be made within 3 days after the announcement. Buy and sell the company&#39;s stocks; after the shareholding reaches 5%, every time the shareholding increases or decreases by 1%, the listed company should be notified and announced on the next day. These regulations are made because shareholders holding more than 5% of the shares are considered important shareholders, and their stock buying and selling behavior may have an important impact on the company&#39;s stock price and affect the rights and interests of other small shareholders, so they need to be disclosed in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of establishing the stock market is to allow listed companies to obtain the funds needed for business development, while also providing investors with the opportunity to share the company&#39;s future earnings. There are usually two ways for listed companies to create value for investors, one is to increase the stock price, and the other is to pay cash dividends. However, the stock prices of many A-share listed companies have fallen below the issue price (breaking the issue), which means that the stock prices have not risen since listing, but have fallen. Although it cannot be ruled out that some investors have made profits during the rise and fall process, but Overall, investors lost money. According to statistics from Jiemian News, as of the close of trading on September 6, 2023, 758 A-share listed companies had broken their shares, accounting for a large proportion of the more than 5,000 listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s look at dividends. According to data from the China Association of Public Companies, since the establishment of the capital market, the total cumulative cash dividends of all listed companies is less than 16 trillion yuan, while the total equity financing, including initial offerings and refinancing, has reached 18 trillion yuan. The total amount of cash dividends is not as large as the total amount of financing. In other words, overall, Chinese stock market investors are still giving blood to listed companies without getting enough returns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is in this investment environment that the controlling shareholders and actual controllers of listed companies have repeatedly cashed out large amounts of money by reducing their holdings of the company&#39;s stocks, cutting off the rights of small and medium-sized shareholders. This is almost a chronic disease of A-shares, which has attracted investors&#39; attention. Criticize. The purpose of listing many A-share companies is to make money. The major shareholders and actual controllers have never thought about creating value for investors. Some companies used financial fraud and other means to pass the listing review and raise the issuance price at the beginning of their listing. After listing, they seized every opportunity to cash out, either through reduction of holdings, or through mortgage stock loans, and some refinanced again. Make money from the stock market. It is for this reason (and of course because of long-standing illegal phenomena such as information disclosure violations and stock price manipulation) that the A-share market is called a &quot;leek harvester&quot; and &quot;speculative market&quot; by some investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These unreasonable phenomena in the stock market have seriously harmed the interests of investors, especially small and medium-sized investors, and also undermined investor confidence. The recent downward trend of the A-share market is closely related to investors&#39; lack of confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to rectify the problem of large shareholders infringing on the interests of small and medium-sized shareholders, the China Securities Regulatory Commission recently promulgated new regulations &quot;Further Regulating Share Reduction Behavior&quot;, which requires listed companies to have broken shares or net losses, or have not made any cash in the past three years. If the amount of dividends and accumulated cash dividends is less than 30% of the average annual net profit in the past three years, the controlling shareholder or actual controller is not allowed to reduce the company&#39;s shares through the secondary market. That is to say, if a listed company does not create enough value for secondary market investors, its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, etc. are not allowed to realize it by reducing their holdings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of the new regulations is good, but the key is whether they can be implemented. Therefore, this time when shareholders of listed companies such as Wole Home Furnishing and Oriental Fashion illegally reduced their holdings, investors were waiting to see how the regulatory authorities would punish them. If the exchanges continue to lightly “condemn” and “warn” as before without substantive penalties, then the new regulations will obviously not have much deterrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, judging from the recently announced processing progress, the regulatory authorities are obviously serious this time: the major shareholders of Wolejia were confiscated and imposed huge fines on their illegal reduction of holdings, basically spitting out All proceeds from the shareholding reduction (including the proceeds from the legal shareholding reduction); and the chairman of Oriental Fashion was found to have other behaviors of manipulating stock prices and will be held criminally responsible. Vigorous enforcement of laws is undoubtedly of great significance in boosting market confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, restricting major shareholders and actual controllers of listed companies from reducing their holdings only blocks one way for them to realize cash. To make the capital market truly a win-win market for investors and listed companies, and to prevent listing from becoming a way for major shareholders and actual controllers to cut off leeks, more measures are needed to make it more difficult for major shareholders and actual controllers to collect money and realize cash from the stock market. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, new regulations issued by the exchange in February 2023 allow restricted shares to be loaned through refinancing channels. Some people believe that this allows strategic investors to reduce their holdings in disguised form through this mechanism, which may lead to issues such as fairness and institutional consistency. Jindi shares, which was recently listed, sold more than 4.5 million shares (equivalent to short selling) on ​​the first day of listing, with an amount of up to 220 million yuan. These securities were suspected to come from &quot;strategic investors&quot; such as company executives and core employees. Restricted shares held. Previously, there were cases where &quot;strategic investors&quot; lent large sums of restricted shares on the first day of a company&#39;s listing and sold them through securities lending. Whether this involves executives of listed companies &quot;short selling&quot; their own stocks to lock in profits on the first day of listing, and whether it will harm the interests of secondary market investors, is worthy of concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[卖惨打造“大凉山人设”卖假货，水军团伙落网]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256900]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Exciting and tense music&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Hot-selling&quot; products that are only available for ten seconds&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The quality is &quot;superior&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coupled with the tempting comments from &quot;old fans&quot; that flood the screen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many people have experienced this kind of live broadcast to bring goods? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Be careful of falling into the trap of &quot;Internet trolls&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 14 is the Rule of Law Day of the 2023 National Cyber ​​Security Publicity Week.

The dexterous front paws resemble the small hands of a human baby and can grip round nuts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many people, raccoons are cute little animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Raccoons are native to North America and are named &quot;raccoons&quot; because they often perform cleaning actions near water. However, when they came to the European continent, they were on the &quot;blacklist&quot; of invasive alien species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as January 2020, the German-language daily &quot;Grenz Echo&quot; reported that raccoons were infested in eastern Belgium, calling it the &quot;raccoon plague.&quot; In September 2023, Belgian authorities once again disclosed that &quot;50,000 raccoons have made their home in the country&#39;s southern mountains.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the first North American raccoons set foot on the European continent, traders planned a profitable fur business. More than ninety years later, raccoon populations have overrun forests and cities, and the problem of biological invasion is imminent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to control the spread of raccoons, some parts of Europe acquiesce or encourage the hunting of raccoons. However, animal protection groups called it a &quot;massacre&quot; and condemned &quot;hunters&#39; attempts to use so-called species protection slogans and flimsy hunting arguments to justify the massacre.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo, deputy secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Southern Weekend reporters that around the world, when an invasive alien species (IAS) causes very serious ecological problems, it directly Hunting has become one of the last resort methods of governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“However, these measures usually require careful planning and execution to ensure their effectiveness and minimize adverse effects.” Wang Huo said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Raccoon &quot;plague&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to Belgian media reports on September 4, Belgium is fighting against &quot;invading&quot; raccoons. Authorities admit that more than 50,000 raccoons have made their home in Belgium&#39;s forested southern mountains and it is too late to eradicate them by hunting them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Céline Tellier, an environment official in Wallonia, Belgium, said in an interview: &quot;This animal looks very cute. Unfortunately, around the world, invasive alien species Species are one of the five major causes of biodiversity degradation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is an unprecedented and spectacular invasion.&quot; Eric Alkemade, Liège, Belgium A professional hunter in the city told Southern Weekend reporters that since the invasive crisis emerged, he has received many calls about raccoons every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As commissioned by customers, he captures 9-15 raccoons every month. His income has increased significantly thanks to a surge in local raccoon business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In people&#39;s imagination, raccoons are cute little friends. But in fact, if they are not satisfied, they will be very aggressive.&quot; Eric said that raccoons have sharp claws. Will scratch and bite hard. When they cannot find food on balconies, they may sneak into human homes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The damage caused by raccoons is self-evident.” Eric said raccoons can destroy the nests of various birds, including black storks. In addition, raccoons will also attack human poultry and pets, such as &quot;chickens, rabbits, ducks&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the raccoon population is limited, perhaps humans can keep an appropriate distance from these &quot;troublemakers.&quot; Unfortunately, the raccoon population is growing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In recent years, the number of raccoons in continental Europe is estimated to have exceeded 500,000. In addition to Belgium, in many European countries, this animal has also become an invasive alien species that causes headaches for the authorities.&quot; Wang Huo said to the south Reporters over the weekend said that raccoons have been included in the European Union&#39;s List of Invasive Alien Species of Concern since 2016. This means that throughout the European Union, the import, breeding, transport, commercialization or intentional release of raccoons into the natural environment is not allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why does the little raccoon make the European Union &quot;colorful&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Raccoons are omnivores and feed on birds, insects, aquatic organisms and plants. Overpopulation will not only compete with native animals for food, but also directly threaten local biodiversity .&quot; Wang Huo said that raccoons can destroy habitats, especially when looking for food. They may dig burrows or destroy trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, raccoons carry many viruses including rabies, posing a threat to local wildlife and domestic livestock. Raccoons sometimes forage in trash cans, causing waste management and sanitation issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Survival Master&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The introduction of North American raccoons into Europe originated from two man-made species migrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public reports, raccoons were introduced to Germany during the Nazi rule in the 1930s for hunting and fur. In the 1960s, many of the animals brought to France as mascots were released by U.S. Air Force personnel, and they took up residence around an air base in the Aisne region of France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo added many details to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1930s, raccoon fur fashion was once popular, and many breeding farms in Germany raised raccoons. However, captive raccoons were not as good as wild ones, so some female raccoons were released into the forests of western Germany. Within ten years, a stable population was established and expanded to eastern Germany. In 1945, due to war air raids, many farmed raccoons escaped and became wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Belgium is located between Germany and France, so it has naturally become a migration destination for many raccoons. In their new home, the raccoon population ushered in a period of rapid growth, showing strong adaptability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In the wild, raccoons can find nutritional supplements on land, underwater, in trees, almost anywhere. In cities and towns, raccoons can find food by digging through garbage. , climb into human houses and courtyards to look for food. In addition, raccoons are cute in appearance, and humans are usually not hostile to them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of breeding strategy, raccoons often choose tree holes, ground holes or caves as their breeding grounds. These places provide a relatively safe and secluded environment that facilitates the survival of the pups. Also, raccoons don’t nurse for long. Raccoon pups are weaned and start living independently by the end of the summer of the same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu, an animal keeper at Nanning Zoo in Guangxi, told Southern Weekend reporters that compared to other mammals, raccoons have stronger reproductive capabilities. For example, monkeys give birth to one baby a year, and they start reproducing at an average age of 3-4 years. Raccoons can give birth to about 4 babies a year, and they mature sexually early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, raccoons also have many advantages in survival. &quot;In nature, raccoons can swim, dig holes, climb, and can survive on trees and on the ground. In cities, garbage is the easiest way for raccoons to obtain food. However, raccoons also rely on human garbage to survive. But it is bigger than mice, has fewer natural enemies, and can even fight with human pet cats and dogs, so it has obvious advantages,&quot; Mr. Liu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The out-of-control proliferation of raccoons in Europe may also have something to do with the scarcity of wild animals that can control them (such as hawks, falcons, wolves, foxes, etc.). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo pointed out that the owl is a common small raptor, but it is fatal to raccoon pups. In nature in Europe, if there are raptors circling nearby, the nursing mother raccoon will be forced to move with her cubs in her mouth and find another safe nest. In a healthy natural ecosystem, a significant proportion of the pups will die in the first 6 months, and only a proportion will survive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eric told Southern Weekend reporters that some Belgian residents hope to use the natural food chain of raccoons to maintain ecological balance through natural enemies of raccoons, such as foxes and wolves. But it was &quot;too late&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eric said that in order to achieve the effect of controlling raccoon numbers, wolves must settle in certain areas for a long time. At the same time, raccoons&#39; rapid reproduction created an imbalance between prey and predators. &quot;This war is already unequal. Without drastic measures, it will be difficult to curb their rapid growth,&quot; Eric said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Hunting&quot; controversy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In recent years, hunting has become one of the common ways to control the proliferation of raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data disclosed by the German Hunting Association (DJV), during the 2020-2021 hunting season, German hunters legally captured 200,163 raccoons, a 57-fold increase in two decades. The association also revealed that the number of raccoons hunted has continued to rise since the 1990s. This indicates that &quot;invasive species have spread widely across space.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to control the proliferation of raccoons, there are even organizations that pay special fees to remove raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Belgian hunter Eric told Southern Weekend reporters that he usually accepts commissions from the private sector or local municipal departments to hunt, and is paid monthly, usually 1,500 euros per person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eric revealed that the local government had used water conservancy and forestry officials to eradicate raccoons, but &quot;their numbers were too few and their equipment was not good.&quot; Eric holds a hunting license and has professional hunting skills. &quot;I go to see the traps I set every day. I have a weapons license, rich experience, and well-equipped equipment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Eric&#39;s work was not recognized by everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“A lot of naive people protect and feed raccoons and think I’m a savage.” Eric said that the prevailing animal protection trend has made people sensitive to hunting raccoons, but he feels that his job It is in the public interest and to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, hunting measures have also been opposed by some animal protection organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The German People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA-Team) has called for &quot;an end to unnecessary raccoon hunting.&quot; The association offers five reasons for protecting raccoons, including that hunting raccoons is counterproductive because &quot;raccoons may respond to hunting by increasing reproduction,&quot; and that raccoons pose no threat to local biodiversity because &quot;endangered species are rarely Raccoon Food” etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noted that the organization launched an online petition in July 2022, calling on the European Commission to remove raccoons from the list of invasive species. So far, it has 7,643 supporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In North America, where raccoons are native, people have a more tolerant attitude towards raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A1 Raccoon Doctor&quot; small animal protection company is located in Toronto, Canada. The company&#39;s main business area is to help customers deal with wildlife invasion, pest protection and other issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees of the company told Southern Weekend reporters that they often encounter raccoons at work and often invade human homes. Two months ago, a raccoon attacked people and pet dogs in Vancouver. &quot;The puppy was blinded in one eye.&quot; It also happens that humans become infected with rabies virus after contact with raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the areas served by the company, people still hold a tolerant attitude towards raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The law does not allow us to hunt wild animals. We only expel some raccoons that have invaded human settlements. Everyone basically has a good impression of raccoons.&quot; An employee of the company told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Houston, USA, raccoons often come to the yard of Chinese Xiao Ai&#39;s (pseudonym) home to eat at the &quot;buffet&quot;, which is a self-service feeding box specially set up by Xiao Ai for raccoons. There are also chickens and fish in the yard, but &quot;the raccoons never rumble.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Ai said that when she rented an apartment in the past, she often saw raccoons rummaging through public trash cans at night. &quot;But they just go through the garbage and leave after eating. Sometimes neighbors who throw away garbage will encounter raccoons. &quot;Most of them think they are cute, and I have never seen anyone panic or disgusted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Raccoons don&#39;t Unprovoked invasion and destruction. &quot;In Xiao Ai&#39;s view, humans have invaded the homes of wild animals, causing raccoons to lack food and have to dig through garbage to eat. She opposes the killing of raccoons and advocates the use of sterilization to control the overpopulation of raccoons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo believes that compared with Compared with killing, sterilization is usually regarded as a relatively mild and humane method to control the population of invasive alien species. However, this method also needs to consider factors of time, resources and feasibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; “Controlling the proliferation of invasive species is a complex issue that often requires a combination of measures. &quot;Wang Huo believes that dealing with the problem of invasive species requires comprehensive consideration of various factors, including the characteristics of the species, environmental conditions, and social and ethical considerations. Usually, the best approach is to adopt a combination of methods to maximize Minimize adverse impacts on local ecosystems and economies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[第31届澳门国际烟花比赛汇演璀璨进行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256910]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[数据安全榜：守护你的数字财富，哪家金融机构的金盾更坚固？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256908]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 11:27:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the era of digital finance, the security of personal information, especially personal financial information, is related to everyone’s wealth security, and even more so to finance. The mission of the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, regulatory agencies have always regarded protecting the security of personal financial information as an important regulatory task. From September 15 to October 15, 2023, the State Administration of Financial Supervision, the People&#39;s Bank of China and other relevant ministries and commissions are jointly carrying out the &quot;Financial Consumer Rights Protection Education and Publicity Month&quot; activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as April 2021, the People&#39;s Bank of China has issued the &quot;Financial Data Security &amp;nbsp;Data Life Cycle Security Specifications&quot; (JR/T 0223-2021). This &quot;Specification&quot; combines the characteristics of financial data to sort out the security principles, protection requirements, organizational guarantee requirements and information system operation and maintenance guarantee requirements of financial data life cycle, and establish financial data covering the entire cycle of data collection, transmission, storage, use, deletion and destruction. Security management framework. Among them, the protection of personal financial information has become an important part of the security management of financial data life cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, the data security of financial institutions is like an indestructible golden shield, and the strength of the golden shield reflects the strength of financial institutions in protecting data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to objectively evaluate the data security level of various financial institutions, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center set up eight secondary indicators from four dimensions, and assigned different weights to the sub-items according to the importance of each indicator. . Under this indicator system, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center selected the &quot;Data Security List&quot; based on the information related to eight secondary indicators disclosed in the 2022 annual reports, 2022 ESG reports or social responsibility reports of 26 financial institutions. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given that the data security standards of various financial institutions are quite strict and no serious incidents have occurred, this list only reflects the strategic attention and execution capabilities of financial institutions to data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Four dimensions&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Eight sub-indicators&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Data Security Ranking&quot; evaluation The indicator system is divided into four dimensions: organizational construction, institutional processes, technical tools and effectiveness. At the same time, we subdivided the above four dimensions into eight secondary indicators. The following is a detailed description of the relevant indicator system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jKH2o2u2BWOHs3WZgtu2brTExaaYzLlkJcXIONcM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;968&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jKH2o2u2BWOHs3WZgtu2brTExaaYzLlkJcXIONcM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251050&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Organizational Building&lt;/strong>;Yes Refers to the organizational structure of financial institutions in terms of data security. The evaluation team of Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center considers the number of relevant responsible departments disclosed by financial institutions. This indicator reflects the importance financial institutions attach to data security and information protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;System process&lt;/strong>; refers to the degree of standardization of the process of building a data security system by financial institutions. This indicator is mainly comprehensively considered through two secondary indicators: the number of its own relevant systems and the number of supplier management-related normative documents. The degree of standardization of the process is an important indicator to consider whether the construction of the data security system of a financial institution is reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Supplier management&lt;/strong>; refers to the process by which financial institutions conduct effective risk identification and assessment of external partners (IT service providers, cloud service platforms, etc.). Vendors have access to sensitive data from financial institutions. Security vulnerabilities and irregularities in vendor behavior can result in information or data security incidents for financial institutions. Therefore, financial institutions conduct rating reviews of suppliers every year. However, most financial institutions currently only focus on the performance of suppliers in terms of environmental protection and social responsibility. In order to strengthen the importance that financial institutions attach to the management of suppliers&#39; data security, the evaluation team of the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has disclosed the performance of financial institutions. The number of documents on the supplier management system is also taken into consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Technical tools&lt;/strong>; are the core part of the network security system. This first-level indicator directly reflects the financial institution&#39;s ability to protect data and privacy and the effectiveness and reliability of data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this first-level indicator, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center evaluation team set three secondary indicators: the number of relevant patents, the number of relevant systems, and the number of certification systems. Among them, the number of relevant patents refers to the number of patents containing words such as data security, information security, vulnerability and attack in the patent summaries applied for by the financial institution under evaluation that year. The number of relevant systems is based on the number of platforms and systems mentioned in the annual report of the financial institution under evaluation. The number of certification systems comes from the number of certifications published in the annual reports of the financial institutions under evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, during the evaluation process, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that some banks did not disclose the secondary indicator data for this evaluation. Therefore, in order to reduce information asymmetry, financial institutions that do not publish a certain indicator will have the lowest score for that indicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Effectiveness&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Indicator&lt;/strong>; is the only qualitative indicator in this list, consisting of the number of security incidents (minus points) and awards (plus points). Among them, the award indicators are assigned different levels of points according to the level and number of awards. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Overall ranking&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;ICBC&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;tops the list&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt; strong>;The number of Ping An’s patents is second only to ICBC&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/1Q2N7rJ470IscYbRe50roxJWnSj6t4V2zkk1E7n4.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1214&quot; height=&quot;2132&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/1Q2N7rJ470IscYbRe50roxJWnSj6t4V2zkk1E7n4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 251053&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The data security list of financial institutions shows that Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ranks first, followed by Bank of China, China Life and Agricultural Bank of China in the second tier. Among joint-stock banks, Industrial Bank and China Everbright Bank performed well. Among them, China Everbright Bank was better in terms of relevant systems and the number of certifications obtained, while Industrial Bank received the award for disclosing detailed data security and privacy protection work in its annual report. More points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the number of patents, state-owned banks are stronger, and the number of patents of state-owned banks is generally higher than that of joint-stock banks and insurance companies. However, it is worth noting that the number of related patents of Ping An of China, 119, is only lower than that of ICBC, 259. Looking only at this secondary indicator, Ping An ranks second in the entire list. This is because Ping An has both banking and insurance businesses. Compared with financial institutions in a single industry, Ping An&#39;s data is more diverse and complex, and its requirements for ensuring data security are also higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of comprehensive quantitative indicators, Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China rank among the top three state-owned banks, with total quantitative indicator scores all exceeding 400 points. The Postal Savings Bank of China ranks last with a quantitative indicator score of 196 points, and is the only institution on this list with a total quantitative indicator score of less than 200 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of comprehensive qualitative indicators, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Life Insurance and Bank of Communications ranked among the top three, with scores greater than 150 points. Among them, ICBC ranks first, mainly because the awards it has received are all national-level and it has been selected as a pilot demonstration unit in multiple fields of data security. China Life and Bank of Communications follow closely behind with multiple awards at different levels in terms of qualitative indicators. In addition, Pacific Insurance, China Merchants Bank, PICC and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank did not disclose awards in their 2022 annual reports, resulting in scores of 0 for their qualitative indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering the different nature of banking and insurance businesses, the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center evaluation team split the overall list into two sub-lists: the data security list of banking financial institutions and the data security list of insurance financial institutions. The list is designed to more objectively present the data security competitiveness of financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Bank list: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;While the pursuit is underway&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;there are leaders in each echelon&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/gUNn9FWoESsYi8bMLgbU2GEpU9xiJJEfU6gkbE38.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1736&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/gUNn9FWoESsYi8bMLgbU2GEpU9xiJJEfU6gkbE38.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251052&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The data security list of banking financial institutions shows that, Among the six major state-owned banks, the three major state-owned banks, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China, rank in the top three. Bank of Communications and China Construction Bank ranked seventh and eighth. The above five state-owned banks are all ranked in the top ten. The Postal Savings Bank of China ranked last with a score of 125.65 points, a gap of 223.93 points from the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Postal Savings Bank’s poor performance in data security may be related to its low level of digital construction. In the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256025&quot; title=&quot;Digital Finance List: ICBC ranks first among banks, AIA ranks last among insurance companies&quot;>;Digital Finance List: ICBC ranks first among banks First, AIA ranked last among insurance companies, Postal Savings Bank of China ranked last among the six major state-owned banks with a score of 431.62. Therefore, the Postal Savings Bank still needs to work hard on digital financial construction and data security system construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the joint-stock banks, Industrial Bank, Ping An Bank and China Everbright Bank surpassed the two major state-owned banks, Bank of Communications and China Construction Bank, with 238.36 points, 237.24 points and 233.94 points respectively, relying on their advantages in technical tool indicators to rank among Top six. However, the performance of China Guangfa Bank, Hua Xia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank in terms of data security is not as good as that of some city commercial banks. These three banks are all ranked after the tenth, and are interspersed among the rankings of city commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;City commercial banks are subject to factors such as geography, business volume and scale, and their overall scores are lower than those of state-owned banks and joint-stock banks. But there are also some who perform better. Taking Bank of Ningbo and Bank of Beijing as examples, these two city commercial banks surpassed China Guangfa Bank and Hua Xia Bank, two joint-stock banks, with 185.48 and 172.67 points respectively. From the perspective of qualitative indicators, the results of these two city commercial banks are relatively outstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Insurance ranking: China Life&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;won&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;award&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;won&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong >;&lt;strong>;Ping An patents dominate&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/6E0HX8QJdDA3nDV7hrRH1nhVTesqboNb52zTv5Vt.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;968&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/6E0HX8QJdDA3nDV7hrRH1nhVTesqboNb52zTv5Vt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251051&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; Looking at the data security rankings of financial institutions in the insurance industry, China Life and Ping An of China rank first and second due to their advantages in the number of awards and patents respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the insurance industry, China Life has built the industry&#39;s first safe, green and elastic hybrid cloud. This distributed hybrid cloud won the special prize of the second &quot;Financial Innovation Achievement Award&quot; of the Capital Financial Innovation Incentive Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the number of data security-related patents, except for Ping An of China, which received 119 patents due to its business nature of both banking and insurance, the number of data security-related patents disclosed by other insurance institutions did not exceed 5 indivual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sunshine Insurance ranks low in various index scores in terms of data security, resulting in a total score at the bottom. It is also the only financial institution with a score below 150 in the data security list of financial institutions in the insurance industry. Similar to the Postal Savings Bank, Sunshine Insurance ranked first in the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256025&quot; title=&quot;Digital Financial List: ICBC ranked first among banks, AIA ranked last among insurance companies&quot;>; Digital finance list: ICBC ranks first among banks, and AIA ranks last among insurance companies. It ranks second from last in the digital finance list of insurance financial institutions. Regardless of digital finance or data security, there is still a certain distance between Sunshine Insurance and other financial institutions. However, it cannot be ruled out that the score is related to the small amount of data disclosed by Sunshine Insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, the digital finance and data security construction of lower-ranked banking financial institutions and insurance financial institutions are not perfect enough. Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that these companies urgently need to improve their strategic considerations for digital transformation and pay attention to building and improving data security systems while improving the level of digital finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also called on financial institutions to disclose relevant data and information as much as possible to make it more transparent to enhance customer trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Assistant researcher Zou Huan, Liang Chenghao and Yang Chaoqun also contributed)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt; hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[ATACMS对乌克兰意味着什么？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256761]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/n5CMyGKnUQVVAef0mY1dPG61CXHPI9TyzeJvUxcd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/n5CMyGKnUQVVAef0mY1dPG61CXHPI9T yzeJvUxcd. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250520&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) data picture&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, a U.S. official told the media that the Biden administration is considering supplying long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to Ukraine. Another official also confirmed to the media that the supply of this missile is &quot;on the table&quot; and may be included in the upcoming security assistance plan. However, the official also said that no decision has been made yet and that it may take several months for Ukraine to receive the missiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Ukrainian President Zelensky publicly declared: &quot;Ukraine needs long-range missiles to deprive the occupiers of the opportunity to use missiles to destroy Ukrainian cities far away from the front line.&quot; The Ukrainian military will ATACMS missiles are regarded as the top priority weapons and equipment to be obtained, even higher than F-16 fighter jets. Before launching a counteroffensive in July 2023, Zelensky even stated: &quot;Without long-range weapons, it will not only be difficult to perform offensive missions, but also difficult to conduct defense.&quot; In short, after tireless pressure, Ukraine seems to be about to get the weapons they want. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what is so powerful about this missile that Ukraine is so obsessed with? Why does Ukraine think this is the key to its victory? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ATACMS is a tactical ballistic missile manufactured by Lockheed Martin of the United States. It is also the only ballistic missile currently equipped by the U.S. Army. The development of this missile began in 1980 and is used to attack important targets such as logistics and reserve positions behind enemy lines. The ATACMS missile is equipped with a solid propellant engine, has a range of up to 300 kilometers, and a terminal speed of up to three times the speed of sound. It can be launched from the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 HIMARS, both of which are already equipped. Ukrainian army and performed well in actual combat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the Ukrainians, the great role of ATACMS is to extend the range of the Seamass rocket launcher that had previously shined in the battle, and its power has also increased. This missile can carry a penetrating high-explosive warhead weighing more than 230 kilograms and is used to destroy strong fortresses with a circumferential error of only 9 meters. This heavy-duty high-explosive warhead is not only extremely lethal to Russian fortresses, but it can also be equipped with a submunition warhead to destroy targets such as airport radar stations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the key issue is that the range of this missile is far enough. If ATACMS is obtained, the Ukrainian army can directly strike Russian military targets in the Crimea area from the current front, and even directly attack them. Crimean Bridge, and Russia’s air defense system was not sure of intercepting it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ukrainian army has previously obtained long-range precision-guided weapons such as Storm Shadow with a range of nearly 300 kilometers. Although the effect is good in actual combat, it has not been used many times. The main reasons are the following three problems: First of all, Britain and France, the donor countries for missiles such as Storm Shadow, do not have much equipment themselves, so the quantity they can provide to Ukraine is also quite limited; secondly, such missiles can currently only be mounted on modified Su-24 fighter-bombers. However, Ukraine&#39;s air force has suffered heavy losses after more than a year of fighting. The number it can dispatch is limited, and it also needs to be careful about interception by Russian fighter planes. Therefore, it can only hide dozens of kilometers behind its own front lines, which also reduces the range of missiles. shortening; another technical problem is that air-launched missiles often have higher requirements for reconnaissance of the target area. For example, the missile needs to inject a three-dimensional image of the target building so that it can hit a more precise vulnerable location, which is also more effective for pre-attack reconnaissance. High requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, ATACMS can avoid the above problems. First of all, the US military has equipped more than 2,000 of this missile, and other allies also have more than 1,000 in stock. The United States is planning to phase out this missile and switch to a missile with a longer range. Once the United States relents on its long-range replacement model, the amount of supply to Ukraine will be considerable, which will also help the United States update its army&#39;s long-range missile weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, Ukraine already has dozens of Haimas and M270 systems that can launch ATACMS in service, and land-based launch platforms are easier to conceal and can fire closer to the battle line. As long as the number of missiles is in place, the frequency of attacks will increase. can be greatly improved. In addition, the reconnaissance business before the launch of surface-to-surface ballistic missiles will also become relatively simple. You only need to know the geographical coordinates of the target to launch it. If this missile is deployed in large numbers, it will be difficult for the Russian navy and air force to gain a foothold in the Crimean Peninsula, because these high-value targets will be attacked with high frequency and difficult to defend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once the United States provides ATACMS, it will have a chain effect. Ukraine has repeatedly requested Germany to provide Taurus air-launched cruise missiles with a range of nearly 500 kilometers. This missile has a range of more than 500 kilometers and is more powerful than Storm Shadow. for safety. Another advantage of the Taurus is that it uses a two-stage tandem warhead, which can penetrate the outer wall of the fortification and explode inside, with an intelligent killing effect. Germany had been quite hesitant to provide this weapon because it was unwilling to bear all the pressure from Russia. If the United States is willing to provide ATACMS missiles, Germany should also release Taurus, which will undoubtedly increase Ukraine&#39;s long-range attack capabilities. It can be seen that the changes brought about by ATACMS may be far more than its own fatal lethality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人贩子余华英一审被判死刑，曾拐卖儿童11名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256906]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 11:03:18&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 18, the Guiyang Intermediate People’s Court publicly sentenced the defendant Yu Huaying to one count of child abduction and trafficking. case.
