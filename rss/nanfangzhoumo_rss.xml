It is a haven for essayists in small towns, and it contains the deepest and most profound emotions. The county is the stabilizer among them. When the education gap between urban and rural areas gradually widens, faced with poached teachers, dissatisfied students, and challenges from “super middle schools”, where should the county go?</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 10:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为何偏偏喜欢你——纪念陈百强去世三十年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259244]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/24/23QvzqkdPVNYg95r2IWY5JXs9EwpHgUtc1Qg5Pu7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/23QvzqkdPVNYg95r2IWY5JXs 9EwpHgUtc1Qg5Pu7. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255289&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Baiqiang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data picture/picture )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What do you want in life&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 25, 2023, the 4K restored version of the movie &quot;Encore&quot; was re-screened in Hong Kong. It will also be screened in Xiamen as the closing film of this year&#39;s Golden Rooster Chinese Film Festival to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the death of starring Chen Baiqiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Encore&quot; is director Cai Jiguang&#39;s debut film, starring Chen Baiqiang, Leslie Cheung, Paul Chung, and Weng Jingjing. It was released in 1980 and was Chen Baiqiang&#39;s first starring role. At the age of 22, he played the real role of Ken, a middle school student in the film, and developed various youthful entanglements with Paul played by Paul Chung, Gigo played by Leslie Cheung, and Julie played by Jingjing Weng. The next year, Chen, Zhang and Zhong starred in another youth-themed movie &quot;Unemployed&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Chen Baiqiang, who has been singing all his life, is as famous as his contemporaries such as Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui, he rarely appears in movies and TV dramas. In addition to &quot;Encore&quot; and &quot;The Unemployed&quot;, the only movies in which he had more roles were &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; in 1984 and &quot;An Autumn Fairy Tale&quot; in 1987. Chen Baiqiang did not have this ambition, but these films have inadvertently become some precious records in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5kKprcddnKSC1DKnCBmJ5Vax0CzMKye4FCUaImKf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5kKprcddnKSC1DKnCBmJ5Vax0CzMKye4FCUaImKf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255290&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;1984 movie &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the movie, Chen Baiqiang&#39;s character settings are pretty much the same: a rich man, a good boy, talented, caring, Ambitious, youthful and loyal, and do not give up their ideals for money. In the camera, he looks gentle and elegant, with a slight smile on his face. But the years of hardening are still captured by the camera: in &quot;Encore&quot;, the childlike facial features and the cheerful sunshine in the eyebrows have not yet bloomed. In &quot;Autumn Fairy Tale&quot;, the red lips and white teeth have a hint of melancholy and an inexorable melancholy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1987, Chen Baiqiang&#39;s career had entered the second half. 1985-1986 was the darkest moment in his life experience. During this period, he was ill and everything was not going well. His relationship with the gambling king&#39;s daughter He Chaoqiong was opposed by the He family. The media was not very kind to him, with widespread rumors that he was infected with AIDS, then that he was schizophrenic, and then that he committed suicide. Sometimes the newspaper office also received a breaking news call saying that &quot;Chen Baiqiang was dead.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How can I not mind if you call me, because someone said that I am infected with that disease. When I walk on the street, passers-by look at me like a monster, point at me, and say many things that cannot be done. The words touched my ears.&quot; Chen Baiqiang recalled. In response to the rumors, he took a test at the suggestion of others but refused to make the test results public. Perhaps as a countermeasure, he also wore a T-shirt with the words &quot;I GOT AIDS&quot; printed on it on the plane. This rumor was not completely broken until he was hospitalized in a coma in 1992 and the doctor tested negative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His album &quot;Top 100 84&quot; released in 1984 contains a large number of works adapted from European and American songs, and is unique in the Hong Kong music scene where adaptations of Japanese songs are popular. However, due to misalignment with public taste, none of the songs became his masterpieces. He put great effort into preparing for the concert, imitating the prince&#39;s appearance and performing wearing a crystal mask, but he was criticized by the media and public opinion. He said: &quot;I have been depressed in my heart, and at the same time I found that someone would deliberately hurt me... I was very fragile at the time and attached great importance to external news reports. I didn&#39;t know how to fight back, so I fell into a confused low ebb. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He then released the albums &quot;Loving You Deeply&quot; (1985) and &quot;When I Think of You&quot; (1986), but the company received little publicity for them and the sound was weak. The Hong Kong music scene has also changed from the original competition between Leslie Cheung (Kwok Wing) and Chan (Bai Qiang) to the one between Alan Tam (Alan Tam) and Leslie Cheung (Kwok Wing). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These negative emotions condensed into Chen Baiqiang&#39;s face in &quot;Autumn Fairy Tale&quot; - delicate, handsome but tired. &quot;Autumn Fairy Tale&quot; director Zhang Wanting recalled that during filming, Chen Baiqiang performed very well and could usually pass it in one take. However, he always pursued perfection and chased the director to take another shot and another. &quot;He is a perfectionist, always pursuing better and wanting to be the best.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/24/afNS1AhKBWjPIaKU27X6IU7yebNSFqV5mwORT0la.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/afNS1AhKBWjPIaKU27X6IU7yebNSFqV5mw ORT0la. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255285&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; Chen Baiqiang (middle) with Tony Leung (left) and Andy Lau&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(File photo/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Filmmaker Chen Xinjian and Chen Baiqiang have known each other for many years and played Chen Baiqiang&#39;s uncle in &quot;Encore&quot;. He believed that Chen Baiqiang was unhappy deep down. &quot;That kind of unhappiness is like the core of the earth, burning like a raging fire. He has many happy moments and many friends, but every happy time is quickly evaporated by the fire.&quot; He said, &quot;He has a lot of pressure on himself. The requirements are very high, and if the performance is not good enough, you will be unhappy for a long time. If you perform well, you will be happy for a while, and then you will start to worry about the next performance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such emotions also appear in Chen Baiqiang&#39;s songs. In 1987, he released the album &quot;Dream Man&quot;. The title song of the same name was &quot;I Love Baiyun&quot; he composed in 1980 - it was re-released with new lyrics added by Chen Haiqi. The original song &quot;Look at the white clouds, free and unrestrained, hopeful, unpredictable, floating by, you can only lead the way, the dancing clouds, leaving in a hurry without leaving behind, floating in the distance, the back becomes more and more beautiful&quot; has become &quot;This dreamer is floating away. For whom, I have spent my whole life with a heartbroken heart. At this moment, I think that love is eternal. I have gone back and forth a thousand times in vain. I love secretly without stopping. I leave in a hurry and never stay. My back becomes more and more beautiful.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more widely circulated piece of this album is &quot;My Story&quot; composed by Chen Baiqiang and lyrics by Xiang Xuehui. After the composition was completed, Chen Baiqiang thought it was a reflection of himself. He originally wanted to write the lyrics himself, but was unable to do so. He described his feelings to Xiang Xuehui, and Xiang wrote the current lyrics. During the recording, Chen Baiqiang cried several times and said that the song was a true self-narration. &quot;The face that hides the stories of the past, walking in and out of the day, the blank eyes peeking every day... Time continues to deceive me, there will always be a new day... The painful rumors are very tiring, the past has no trace, trapped in There are many walls, but no one can rebuild happiness from the past.&quot; This autobiographical song resonated with music fans and was rated as one of the top ten Chinese hits of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four years later, Xiang Xuehui filled in the lyrics of another song &quot;Life Cannot Be Determined&quot; for Chen Baiqiang: &quot;I don&#39;t pretend to be free and easy, and I can&#39;t distinguish between sadness and joy...Who knows my heart?&quot; Hot, who knows that there is no need to say it anymore, I still want to be short of it all my life, I don’t want to expose me to others anymore, you will make someone feel lovable...&quot; This song is considered to be a reflection of Chen Baiqiang&#39;s inner feelings at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Ailin, a disc jockey of Radio Hong Kong and a good friend of Chen Baiqiang, believes that Chen Baiqiang is a very sensitive person and this is where he succeeds. He is very sensitive to emotions and can bring that feeling out in his songs. But at the same time, he is also very painful because he is sensitive and cares about what others think of him. &quot;His music can come out, but his personal emotions cannot.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;His melodies are rarely happy. Most of his music represents his character, which is relatively lonely.&quot; With Chen Baiqiang Summarized by Xu Riqin, who has collaborated on many albums. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/chsHHuxl9wwBeS4tmG6aQjlKcM2CFEol5v3pylVM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;521&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/chsHHuxl9wwBeS4tmG6aQjlKcM2CFEol5v3pylVM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255288&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The 1981 movie &quot;Unemployed&quot;, Chen Baiqiang (right) and Leslie Cheung&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1989, Chen Baiqiang released the album &quot;What I Want in Life&quot;, and the title song of the same name &quot;Life&quot; &quot;What do you want&quot; was rated as one of the top ten Chinese golden songs and one of the top ten golden songs of the year. His unhappiness is concentrated in this song: What do I want in life? I can never see clearly in my confusion. I didn’t expect that what I lost is already everything I have. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the later period, Chen Baiqiang kept himself to himself. He didn&#39;t want to face people and lost his previous glory.&quot; said Huang Baigao, a manager who worked with Chen Baiqiang. Later in his career, Chen Baiqiang&#39;s original works gradually decreased. Chen Jiaying, his agent at the time, recalled that on the one hand, Chen Baiqiang was worried about his lack of creative power. On the other hand, the Four Heavenly Kings also appeared. He put more pressure on himself, and his creations decreased. &quot;He doesn&#39;t always greet people with a smile. He drinks to numb himself in the later stage. Only after drinking does he have the courage to talk about his feelings and make himself emotionally high. In fact, he is a tragic figure, not a comedy.&quot; Chen Jiaying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1990, Chen Baiqiang refused to accept any job. Chen Jiaying once received a call from him late at night: I am at home, have a sip of champagne and take a sleeping pill. When he put down the phone and rushed to Chen Baiqiang&#39;s home, Chen was already in a coma. Fortunately, he was sent to the hospital in time and there was no danger. &quot;After he was fine, I tried very hard to encourage and enlighten him. Unfortunately, he always had his own outlook on life. No matter how much I tried, he always saw things in gray.&quot; Chen Jiaying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/myP13ivIia50mV4Z6qnaZlezzmEYLHFHC278agpN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/myP13ivIia50mV4Z6qnaZlezzmEYLHFHC278agpN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1993, Chen Baiqiang passed away, and his close friends Anita Mui, Chow Yun-fat and others supported him&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>; p>; &lt;p>;Some media photographed Chen Baiqiang&#39;s residence at that time, located at Royal Garden, 9A Kennedy Road, Central and Western District, Hong Kong. It was built by him himself and was all black. Entering the room, the entire 2,000-square-foot area is almost pitch black: black carpet, black walls, black sofa, black dining table, black dining chairs, black marble candlesticks, and a shiny black piano. The only colorful thing is the wallpaper on the living room wall. painting, a work by the Italian abstract expressionist painter Adevor. The bedroom has black bedsheets, black bedding, black pillowcases, black carpet, black slippers, black cloakroom, black desk, black crystal metallic lion decoration, black beauty couch... Only the floor lamp is not black. The media described him as &quot;very repressed.&quot; Chen Baiqiang also has a house near the Royal Garden. The style is completely opposite. The whole house is white. This was regarded by the outside world as an externalization of his melancholy mood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From January 30 to February 1, 1992, Chen Baiqiang held three &quot;Farewell Shanghai Concerts&quot; and announced his farewell to the music scene at the end of the year. Chen Jiaying recalled that the performance was very successful. &quot;He was so happy and felt that he had accomplished something.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 18, 1992, Chen Baiqiang was found unconscious in his residence and was sent to the hospital for rescue. He remained in a coma for 17 months. On October 25, 1993, Chen Baiqiang died of brain failure at the age of 35. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Xtf4hgIb42kB0WfH2lysMf4eRxF4K1sQgHNOVB0M.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Xtf4hgIb42kB0WfH2lysMf4eRxF4K1sQgHNOVB0M.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255287&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Baiqiang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(&quot;Breakthrough&quot;/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;I just like you&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ten years ago, in 1983, Chen Baiqiang’s career reached its peak. He released the album &quot;I Just Like You&quot;. The soulful song of the same name was quickly sung by fans and ranked high on major charts. His status in the music scene has also skyrocketed. Musician Lin Yifeng believes that this song expresses the psychology of the crowd at that time: eager to be understood, but afraid of being hurt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the most widely circulated of his many golden songs, and it is also the one that best represents his characteristics: fresh, simple, and slightly sad. Compared with his various attempts in the future, this kind of soothing, gentle and noble love songs are more integrated with him. Represented by this, Chen Baiqiang is closely connected with the memory of Chinese music, which continues to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Singer and actor Zhong Zhentao analyzed that Chen Baiqiang uses the Qi method of Cantonese opera when singing. Coupled with his personal temperament, he is good at performing minor-key songs and can interpret old and traditional melodies in a modern way. When he was a teenager, Chen Baiqiang often went to see the performances of the Wenner Band, where he met Zhong Zhentao and Alan Tam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1982, Chen Baiqiang released the album &quot;Talking&quot;, in which the song &quot;Take Care of Tonight&quot; was adapted from the 1961 classic old song - composed by Wang Fuling and sung by Cui Ping. After the Cantonese version of Chen Baiqiang&#39;s &quot;Take Care of Tonight&quot; was released, it won the first Top Ten Golden Melody Award, and the album sold more than 250,000 copies. At the same time, &quot;Ripples&quot; composed by him also won the Top Ten Chinese Golden Melody Award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moving forward, his first album &quot;First&amp;nbsp;Love&quot; released in 1979 has become very popular, and the song &quot;Tears Flow for You&quot; soon ranked among the top ten Chinese hits. Chen Baiqiang became an instant hit and became a popular star in the Hong Kong pop music scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/nke2yavYUhXZMaKLvUYi5ZubhS74jLVWWbyZ7OEj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/nke2yavYUhXZMaKLvUYi5ZubhS74jLVWWbyZ7OEj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255286&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Baiqiang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hong Kong at that time, he adapted and sang Japanese songs are the mainstream. Chen Baiqiang has adapted a few songs, including songs from Europe and the United States, as well as a large number of original works, which makes him particularly eye-catching among other singers. He is handsome, can sing and write, plays the piano very well, can also play the guitar, is good at drawing, and has excellent clothing taste. Such an almost perfect image made his popularity rise rapidly after his debut. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People were curious about where he came from, and the results of the media exploration did not disappoint them. It was a growth history of a noble son that met people&#39;s expectations: On September 7, 1958, Chen Baiqiang was born in Hong Kong, and his father Chen Pengfei was. Founder of Jinbao Watch Company in Central. His father liked him very much and planned to train him to be his successor. But his mother was not a big family. Throughout his childhood, he and his mother lived elsewhere. Perhaps because of this, his personality is different from other children. He is calm and smart, likes to be neat and tidy, and is polite to others but keeps a distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Baiqiang has had a strong musical understanding since he was a child. He can hum the tunes of many songs after listening to them once. He learned to play the electronic keyboard and piano without a teacher, but he had no interest in studying and said that he &quot;had a headache when I saw textbooks.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In middle school, he was already a famous figure. Deng Ailin was the emcee at a school event and found that the girls were discussing a boy who was handsome, played the piano well, was self-taught, and could compose music. When the later singer Lin Shanshan met Chen Baiqiang for the first time at the third-grade dance of middle school, she danced in front of Chen Baiqiang with all her energy, just to let Chen Baiqiang talk to her. Chen Baiqiang invited her to watch a movie. She looked at Chen Baiqiang&#39;s profile the whole time and thought to herself: He is smiling, he has an expression, and he is showing his true feelings. Can she keep this moment? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, his father initially did not support Chen Baiqiang’s music dream and only wanted him to follow his example and become a businessman. The two quarreled many times until Chen Baiqiang was tired of studying and dropped out of school. He occasionally served as a guest singer for some bands, and sang in Winner&#39;s band and on the radio. It was also during this period that he met Zhong Zhentao and Alan Tam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/7b4pm9iVK2Q8mIn4M53MEWrAIj0o3qMF3jEaIldL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1498&quot; height= &quot;999&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/7b4pm9iVK2Q8mIn4M53MEWrAIj0o3qMF3jEaIldL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255292&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1981, Chen Baiqiang and Weng Jingjing starred in the TV series &quot;Breakthrough&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father finally agreed with Chen Baiqiang&#39;s choice and sent him to the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in the United States for further study. In 1977, he returned to Hong Kong and happened to participate in the &quot;Yamaha Electronic Keyboard Competition&quot; and won the championship. Subsequently, he won the third place in the &quot;Hong Kong Pop Song Writing Invitational Competition&quot; with his self-composed English song &quot;The Rocky Road&quot;. The following year, he once again won the third place in the &quot;Hong Kong Pop Song Composition Invitational Competition&quot; with his personally composed English song &quot;The Sunrise&quot;. He soon attracted the attention of EMI Records and became a signed singer under the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Musician Huang Zhan recalled: &quot;In his &quot;little demon&quot; era (probably meaning that others are small and very elf), he often played with us, so his artistic ability, It’s better to have more people. Danny (Chen Baiqiang’s English name) has been playing the piano for two years and is already very good at it. I was a judge at the Yamaha Electronic Piano Competition that year, and everyone agreed that he deserved to win the championship. Because of his performance , emotional and delicate. There are many who compete with him who have studied longer than him, but none are as good as him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Baiqiang has been taking selfies with his camera for a long time. In the winter of 1979, he set up his camera by a bench on the streets of New York, lay down, looked at the camera, and gave his future self a smile. He also went to the Greek seaside, set up a tripod and camera, and took pictures of himself smiling, with the wind blowing his hair and clothes, and the waves rolling behind him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chow Yun-fat said: &quot;Danny (Benny Chan) is just a big boy. Don&#39;t treat him as an adult, but love him as a child and cherish him...&quot; Chen Xinjian commented on that time Chen Baiqiang: His sadness, coupled with his dark eyes, fascinate many young girls. He makes people feel like a protected, pitiful, kitten in the rain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The combination of various factors makes Chen Baiqiang’s image even more lovable. When Priscilla Chan was still in school, she loved Chen Baiqiang so much that she asked all the boys around her to wear Chen Baiqiang&#39;s hairstyle and make up to look like Chen Baiqiang. And she skipped class to watch Bai Qiang Chen&#39;s movie &quot;Encore.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Baiqiang in this movie has fixed an ideal image of a boy: clean and thin, with short hair and a white shirt, bright eyes, a slightly sad smile, and persistence for his dreams. He originally only lived in every girl&#39;s dream, but he actually appeared in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If they knew his later life, how many people would wish to stop at this moment and say to him: &quot;I just like you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: italics , italic style_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Reference materials: &quot;Emotional Photos of Chen Baiqiang&quot;, &quot;Remembering Chen Baiqiang This Way&quot;, &quot;The 30th Anniversary of Chen Baiqiang&#39;s Farewell&quot;, &quot;The Immortal Legend·Chen Baiqiang&quot;, etc.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从鼠头牛肉到鼠头鸭脖：校园食堂安全谁来负责？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259224]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 23, 2023, in response to the food safety incidents that occurred at North China University of Science and Technology and Jiangxi Industrial Vocational and Technical College, The Food Safety Office of the State Council interviewed the main responsible persons of the governments of Tangshan, Hebei and Nanchang, Jiangxi, and required the local governments to strictly implement their territorial management responsibilities and resolutely maintain the bottom line of campus food safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The food safety incident at Jiangxi Vocational College of Technology in early June 2023 caused a sensation on the entire Internet, and even gave birth to the new term &quot;rat head and duck neck&quot;. The North China University of Science and Technology food safety incident occurred recently on October 10. The same student ate something suspected to be a rat head in the canteen. The store claimed it was beef. Different from the &quot;rat-headed duck-necked incident&quot;, North China University of Science and Technology issued an announcement on the same day, admitting that food hygiene problems occurred in the school cafeteria, and terminated the entrusted operation contract with the relevant company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The appearance of rats in the kitchen of the canteen is nothing new. If the kitchen is not cleaned well, it is easy to attract rats. The canteen of Jiangxi Polytechnic College has been punished for this before. But the appearance of rat heads in meals is really shocking and incomprehensible: How irresponsible must one be for food safety to turn a blind eye to rats in meals? These two campus food safety incidents alarmed the Food Safety Office of the State Council, and they interviewed the main responsible persons of the local government. The high standards showed the serious nature of the incidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Food is the most important thing for the people. Food safety is a top priority. According to the definition of the Food Safety Law, food safety means that food is non-toxic and harmless, meets appropriate nutritional requirements, and does not cause any acute, subacute or chronic harm to human health. This is the minimum requirement for food. Food cannot contain harmful bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms, nor can it contain toxic and harmful chemicals. Of course, there should be no vector organisms like mice that can carry bacteria, viruses, parasites and other hundreds of pathogens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The country has always attached great importance to food safety. In September, when the school year just started, the State Administration for Market Regulation, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Security, and the National Health Commission jointly issued a document calling for effective strengthening of school food safety work. Less than a month later, the rat head beef incident occurred in the canteen of North China University of Science and Technology in Tangshan. The cafeteria management company &quot;committed crimes against the wind&quot;. On the surface, it is a problem with the company that operates the cafeteria, but in fact, there are huge loopholes in the logistics management of the university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The canteens of North China University of Science and Technology and Jiangxi Vocational College of Technology, two universities that have been exposed to food safety problems, are outsourced to third-party companies. But even if it is outsourced, the school still has the first responsibility for the food safety in the canteen and should effectively supervise the third-party company to ensure food safety. But in reality, many colleges and universities often become &quot;hands-off shopkeepers&quot; after outsourcing their canteens. They are indifferent to the daily management of the canteen. If there is a problem, they put all the blame on the supplier and terminate the contract. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As we all know, business in schools is good business. Canteens on campuses of primary and secondary schools can sell them for astronomical prices, let alone universities. Whether it is an ordinary university such as North China University of Science and Technology or a higher vocational college such as Jiangxi Polytechnic College, in addition to enjoying tax benefits, its canteens may also receive subsidies from the government, and the customer base is very stable. Although the food in school cafeterias is generally cheaper than in the outside market, there is still considerable profit margin, so there are still many companies vying to bid for the operation of university cafeterias. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the bidding process and the operation process after winning the bid, are there any hidden exchanges of interests between the operating company and the school&#39;s logistics managers? After the incident involving a rat with a duck&#39;s neck at Jiangxi Vocational College of Technology, the school initially vigorously defended the contractor, immediately reporting that the rat&#39;s head was a duck&#39;s neck, and forcing students who discovered the problem to write a written explanation to &quot;clarify.&quot; This series of operations makes it difficult not to have doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to schools, local government departments are also responsible for supervising food safety in school cafeterias. During this interview, the Food Safety Office of the State Council pointed out that there are problems such as the weakening of territorial management responsibilities for food safety in the two places and the absence of industry management responsibilities of competent authorities. Food safety is the legal responsibility of the market supervision department, and the market supervision bureau should perform supervisory duties on all food business units within its jurisdiction, including local school canteens. However, in the Jiangxi Polytechnic College incident, the local Municipal Supervision Bureau not only failed to strictly perform its duties, but also spoke nonsense and endorsed the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, most universities are at a higher level, and local regulatory authorities may have difficulties in daily supervision. For example, North China University of Science and Technology is a key university in Hebei Province and a department-level unit. Jiangxi Vocational College is also a higher vocational college in Jiangxi Province. The administrative level of these schools is higher than that of the local municipal supervision department. Even the person in charge of the logistics management department may have a higher level than the local supervision department. For example, the director of the Changdong Branch of the Market Supervision Bureau of Nanchang High-tech Zone, who endorsed the canteen of Jiangxi Polytechnic College, is only at the department level, while the leader of the logistics department of Jiangxi Polytechnic College is at least a division-level cadre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, territorial management and industry management responsibilities should not be weakened or absent due to their level. Universities, regardless of their level, should accept the supervision of relevant local departments. Similarly, local regulatory authorities should treat units within their jurisdiction equally and strictly supervise them regardless of their level. In the case of the rat-headed duck-neck incident at Jiangxi Vocational College of Technology, a joint investigation team composed of Jiangxi provincial departments stated in the investigation report that relevant responsible units and responsible persons, such as the school and the local municipal supervisory branch, will be severely dealt with in accordance with laws and regulations. But almost half a year has passed, and there is still no information on whether and how the relevant responsible persons have been dealt with. And if there is no serious accountability for those responsible for supervision negligence, I am afraid that food safety supervision in school cafeterias will still be empty talk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[花里胡哨blingbling的美甲，如今成了猛男的最爱？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258696]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/16/28304bdf2ee9033aa0ddc5cfd9f349a4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;705&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/16/28304bdf2ee9033aa0ddc5cfd9f349a4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254160&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the nude pink nail caps, flowing silver metal lines outline the outline of the nails; the fingers are spread out, and the bright manicure with cool graffiti patterns is eye-catching; He is holding the steering wheel of a luxury car and wearing a famous watch, but the most eye-catching thing is the matte black manicure on his hands...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Who do you think it is when you see these pictures? A woman is sharing her latest manicures. In fact, the owners of these beautiful manicures are all men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Open a social media platform and search for &quot;boys&#39; manicure&quot; and you will open the door to a new world. More and more men are showing off their manicures on the Internet, just like showing off their latest clothes or new limited-edition shoes. Some are showing off the same manicure as a couple with their girlfriends. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Whether it is a &quot;straight man&quot; with a big beard or a &quot;little fresh guy&quot; who is meticulous in dressing up, everyone does not worry about being criticized because of the manicure on their hands. People say &quot;girl&quot;, more and more men are enjoying the satisfaction brought by exquisite manicure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Style on the fingertips&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In modern times, doing manicure is a matter of one&#39;s will Things, but in ancient times, manicure was not something you could just do if you wanted to. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In ancient Egypt, nail color symbolized personal identity and status. Archaeologists have discovered that Nefertiti, the legendary Egyptian beauty with great beauty and queen of Pharaoh Akhenaten, used henna plant juice to dye her fingernails and toenails rust red, symbolizing of nobility and power. Red manicure is exclusive to the royal family, and civilians are restricted to using light colors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more unexpected is that in ancient times, manicure was not an exclusive decoration for women. The history of men&#39;s manicure can be traced back to ancient Babylon around 3200 BC. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, men had to do manicure before going to war. This was one of the important rituals. Soldiers will paint their nails in different colors according to their class: the upper ones will be painted black, and the middle ones will be painted green. They believe that this can intimidate the enemy and enhance morale. It can be seen from this that those who do manicures are the real macho men. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In ancient my country, manicure was also a symbol of class. As we all know, working people work with their hands, and there is no way to grow or dye nails. Therefore, manicures are mostly popular among ladies from famous families. Zhang Hu, a poet of the Tang Dynasty, wrote in a poem: &quot;The ten slender fingers are red as jade bamboo shoots, and the flying geese are gently restrained in the green strings.&quot; The &quot;red jade bamboo shoots&quot; in the sentence refers to the bright red nails painted with kodan. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Are men in ancient my country insulated from manicures? Not necessarily. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the north wall of Cave 335 of the early Tang Dynasty Dunhuang murals, the ministers in front of the emperor under the seat of Manjushri Bodhisattva have feathers on their heads, and one of them has his fingernails painted black. Not only that, the princes of ethnic minorities under the &quot;Vimalakīrti Sutra&quot; on the south side of the east wall of Cave 220 in the early Tang Dynasty in the Dunhuang murals, and the Uighur king and his attendants in the statue of the Xixia king on the south side of the east wall of Cave 409 of the Western Xia Dynasty, all have stained hands. nail. Some scholars believe that the color of fingernails should initially be red because the pigment gradually turns black due to long-term oxidation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be seen that &lt;/span>; from ancient times to the present, from China to the West, men’s manicure is not an unheard-of, absurd and weird thing. The &quot;hippie&quot; movement that was popular in the West in the 1960s and 1970s brought men&#39;s manicure into the field of popular culture. The representative figure of &quot;hippie&quot; culture, rock singer Bob Dylan, appears in public with bright and colorful manicure. British rock icon Mick Jagger also loves to show off his glossy black manicure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Under the guidance of these rock masters, fingernails, which are about 1 square centimeter in size, have gradually become a new position for men to express themselves and show their personality. On social media, many men share their manicures. Fashion trendsetters prefer bright black, tough lines, and graffiti patterns, while sophisticated men prefer everyday nude styles. Showing your own fashion style and trendy charm through personalized nail art styles has become a new way for men to express themselves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/e0288260745ac57acd46fb38166b5b2d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/e0288260745ac57acd46fb38166b5b2d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254162 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Manicure is an attitude towards life&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There is a scene in the 15th episode of &quot;Friends&quot; Season 4. Chandler follows Rachel to the salon and is Rachel flirted with trying a manicure. Seeing all the women coming and going in the store, Chandler felt a little uncomfortable. While complaining that &quot;there are no other men here for manicures&quot;, he blew on the manicures. The micro-expressions on his face revealed his secret inner thoughts. . Rachel choked him back: &quot;Getting manicures won&#39;t hurt your masculinity!&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In recent years, the &quot;appearance economy&quot; has exploded&lt;/span>;, and many Men are paying attention to their beauty needs. More and more people are using skin care products and going to beauty salons to receive beauty services. Abroad, it is very common for men to have manicures. Hammer &amp; Nails, a men&#39;s specialty store specializing in hand and foot care, already has more than 200 stores in the United States. Even during the 2021 COVID-19 pandemic, business revenue still maintained a huge growth of 270%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A survey by the Japanese beauty industry-related research organization &quot;HOTPEPPER Beauty Academy&quot; pointed out that in 2022, 5.7% of Japanese men have used manicure services, and on average, one person in less than 20 people has done so. Nail art, this has also hit a new high in the past five years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Looking back at my country, data from the young people’s lifestyle platform “Little Red Book” shows that between July 2021 and June 2022, the number of searches for “men’s manicure styles” increased for half a year. A month-on-month increase of 302%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After experiencing the first manicure in his life, a man posted a post with emotion, &quot;I always thought it would be weird for boys to do manicures, but I didn&#39;t expect them to look good.&quot; He added #boymanicure It’s also a cool label; there are also men who said that their first manicure was brought to them by their girlfriends. After the experience, they exclaimed “it smells so good” and posted pictures of couple’s manicures to spread the word; there are also male fans. When I get a manicure, I think that after my nails are trimmed, polished, and painted with nude nail polish, my hands will look cleaner and more refined, making me more popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Internet social media provides technical support for people to construct their ideal self, and its rise has also made modern people&#39;s aesthetic standards gradually become symbolic. The popularity of manicures for men shows that manicures are gradually getting rid of the labels of &quot;exclusively for women&quot; and &quot;girly&quot;, and are endowed with social symbols such as &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;trendy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people are eyeing the trend of male manicure and are preparing to &lt;span>; take the plunge. According to Beiqing.com, Zhang, a student from the Academy of Fine Arts, started a business in a Shenzhen market. He set up a stall in the trunk of his car, specializing in male manicures. Similarly, a group of boys from Southwest Airlines Vocational College formed a club called &quot;Boy Manicure Group&quot; to provide manicure services to teachers and students. Classmate He Hao is a member of the club. He said, &quot;I feel great when I bring happiness and beauty to others!&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For students like Zhang and He, In the eyes of generations of young people, beauty is gender-neutral. As an expression of the pursuit of beauty, manicure is also a form of artistic expression to a certain extent. &quot;On the road of pursuing art, we can enjoy ourselves as much as we can, and everyone who loves beauty is equal.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《坠楼死亡的剖析》： 一部重在“关系”的电影]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259007]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/o9fOt7ZSGsFEBUHXLJ0AP8ZJyY9J2ZooYQNktZA0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/o9fOt7ZSGsFEBUHXLJ0AP8ZJyY9J2 ZooYQNktZA0. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254501&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Palme d&#39;Or award-winning work &quot;Anatomy of Death from a Fall&quot; at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival is like a juggler throwing three balls at the same time. The execution is dazzling. It is both a strong plot thriller about an unsolved case and a family film about a broken marriage. In terms of scene presentation, it is also a legal drama in which all dramatic conflicts occur in the courtroom. Director Justine Trier is indispensable for being able to accomplish these three missions at the same time. The Cannes jury awarded her the grand prize undoubtedly in recognition of these visible advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the surface text, &quot;Analysis of Death from Falling from a Building&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Falling from a Building&quot;&lt;/span>; ) also hides some more complex and even theoretical intellectual issues. How can we distinguish between truth and falsehood when we cannot grasp the whole story? When truth and narrative come into conflict, can we persist in our pursuit of the former, or will we be conquered by the emotional power of the latter? From &quot;Battle of Solferreno&quot; to &quot;Sibyl&quot;, director Trier has been obsessed with exploring the complex relationship between text and reality. However, in &quot;Falling&quot;, which seems to be a straightforward commercial genre film, she has pushed her reflection on &quot;narration&quot; to the extreme. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A famous bisexual female writer who is stuck in the quagmire of an unhappy marriage is seizing a rare opportunity to be interviewed by a girl from the literature department, and flirting with her ambiguously while drinking. But noisy music was playing upstairs at this moment: her husband - a man who had just resigned from his university teaching position and tried to write full-time like his wife - was aware of his wife&#39;s schedule and deliberately did not want his wife&#39;s (&lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Interview and Flirtation&lt;/span>;) plan succeeded. The interview had to be interrupted, and the girl and the son of the family left one after another to avoid the embarrassing and noisy situation. When the visually impaired son came home from a walk, the guide dog that led him first discovered the shocking fact: the music was still playing, the sun was still shining in the Alpine sky, but the child&#39;s father had blood all over his head. He fell into the snow and died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it suicide, accident or homicide? The medical examiner could not find sufficient evidence to prove or rule out any of these possibilities, so the only person present at the time of the incident, the deceased&#39;s wife Sandra, was accused of being a suspect and had to be investigated. In the next two hours of this film, we have to work with the judge, lawyers, jury and son Daniel who was unable to witness the scene to find the truth through our own eyes and clues provided by all parties. In this process, the relationship between Sandra and her husband Samuel will be cut into pieces and dismantled by a cold scalpel like the latter&#39;s corpse, and will face the most severe inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the overall setting, we can see the organizational structure of the entire film. This is an intricate network intertwined by various relationships. Everyone is trying to determine their position in the relationship with others, but they are often lost in the flow and change of relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/WuQb9pbuocxqaNObwipCMpp2z5OhCYABfe8cm7ws.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;705&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/WuQb9pbuocxqaNObwipCMpp2z5OhCYABfe8cm7ws.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254500&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;where The most eye-catching thing is naturally the relationship between Sandra and Samuel. Through the few words and fragments of evidence in the court, we can piece together some aspects of this relationship before Samuel&#39;s death: it was due to the uneven shouldering of family responsibilities between the two parties, the imbalance in the sense of worldly success, and the social and cultural differences between the two parties. Differences in background, different emotional appeals, and fundamental differences in personality and attitude towards life, gradually fell apart. We seem to be watching another &quot;Marriage Story&quot; or &quot;The Kramers&quot;. Neither party has made an unforgivable mistake. Everyone has their own reasons and difficulties. Even so, the two people who still love each other will still move forward. Resent and hurt each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But beneath the surface, the film also constructs a more subtle relationship: the relationship between the audience and the heroine. The legal drama format, which occupies most of the film, firmly places the audience in the position of the jury in the court. Through the guidance of facts, reasoning and emotions, we pour empathy into one of the prosecution and defense parties. And together they share the same hatred against the other party. As the truth continues to be revealed and lies continue to be exposed, our trust relationship with all parties is also undergoing subtle adjustments: at first, we will instinctively resent the inference of Sandra&#39;s guilt and the prosecutor&#39;s lawyer who questioned her; As the trial progresses, we discover that Sandra is not as honest as we first thought. As a result, the emotional balance shifts slightly: every word Sandra says from now on will be more questioned in our hearts. At the same time, every difficulty issued by the prosecutor, even including the various questions they raised before, It also makes more sense in our hindsight. The strategic game between the prosecution and the defense in the film is certainly exciting, but the psychological game between the director and the audience, based on the latter&#39;s emotional identification with the heroine, is closer to the focus of the entire film and allows the film to retain suspense. The secret to keeping it until the very last moment—and even until after the film is over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At its true core, the film sets up ambiguous and complex relationships between texts of different materials. The entire film adopts a realistic audio-visual and narrative strategy, but whenever the prosecution and defense raise speculations and memories that cannot be verified by facts during the trial, the camera will start from the perspective of son Daniel sitting in the auditorium. It presents a &quot;psychological image&quot; with a highly subjective fantasy color. Sometimes it is a picture of the father committing suicide, and sometimes it is a picture of the mother punching the father in a rage. As these images accumulate, they finally become &quot;reality&quot; near the end of the film: Danielle testifies in person, reciting a suicidal monologue from his father&#39;s lifetime on the witness stand. However, the father&#39;s voice never appears in the flashback sequence shot by the director, and the son&#39;s narration also adds a bit of ambiguity that is indistinguishable from truth to falsehood because of this carefully placed misplaced detail. We can&#39;t help but wonder: Is this monologue his son&#39;s true memory, or is it a narrative he made up to the judge in order to save a family that is at risk of complete collapse? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film does not reveal the answer to us until the end. But the truth may not be very important. The judge was obviously emotionally moved by Daniel&#39;s words, and the situation was reversed. Sandra was acquitted, and Daniel also re-accepted this mother whom he might not trust, but loved enough. The most intriguing aspect of &quot;Falling&quot; is precisely related to its complex emotions towards &quot;narration&quot; itself: on the one hand, it retains ontological doubts about all narratives, but on the other hand, it unconditionally believes The emotional animal nature of human beings, thereby believing in the infinite power of narrative itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking about &quot;narration&quot; confirms the significance of this film being able to exist independently from similar marriage stories; as for the truth of the entire case, it may only be grasped by that language that does not understand the language but is insightful. In the hearts of Border Collie Guide Dogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 23:55:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当家中老人失能失智：关切老龄化引发的三大社会问题丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259216]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued the &quot;About Organizing and Carrying out Central Financial Support for the Central Financial Support for the Disabled Elderly People with Economic Difficulties&quot; &quot;Notice on Care Services&quot; stipulates that the recipients of assistance are tentatively designated as elderly people who have been included in the scope of minimum living security, have been assessed as completely disabled, and have voluntarily moved into a nursing home. The amount of assistance is the difference between the actual charges for staying in a nursing home after deducting the minimum living security allowance and two subsidies for persons with disabilities that the elderly have received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from a few years ago, there are more than 40 million disabled or semi-disabled elderly people in China, many of whom are also suffering from dementia, such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease. As the population ages, this number will only continue to increase. Data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs shows that as of the end of 2022, there were 280.04 million elderly people aged 60 and over in the country, accounting for 19.8%; among them, there were 209.78 million elderly people aged 65 and over, accounting for 14.9%, a year-on-year increase of 0.9 and 0.7 percentage points respectively. Increases of 12.68 million and 9.22 million. Due to China&#39;s sluggish fertility rate, the number of newborns has almost halved in six years, and the rate of social aging is quite fast. This has led to many social problems that require our serious concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the age and physical and mental conditions of the elderly, we can sort out the specific problems they face according to the timeline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, when the elderly are still &quot;younger elderly&quot;, their physical condition is generally better, and their ability to live, work and study has not significantly declined; there are also a few elderly people who have always been in good health and mentality. These two types of elderly people do not need or need the care of young adults for the time being and do not pose any social problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as we get older, our physical functions and mental abilities will continue to weaken. A considerable number of elderly people will be driven by the instinct of seeking life and hating death, and they will turn to health regimens that claim to help health and longevity. They are particularly keen on health care products and health care equipment. It is not uncommon for people who used to be very frugal and spend two cents of a penny to suddenly turn into buying and selling or even spend a lot of money; there are also a considerable number of elderly people who long for the warmth and affection of family. Although I have no children or my children are not around, I feel extremely lonely. Under the meticulous care and emotional attack of the sales staff, it is very refreshing to spend money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;elderly economy&quot; is essentially a careful hunt for the elderly and &quot;defrauds the elderly economy.&quot; The public prosecutor and the law should show their teeth and carry out a powerful crackdown to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the elderly. Children should also care about their parents&#39; mental and emotional needs, make more phone calls and spend more time with them; if possible, try to live with their parents so that parents can enjoy the rewards of raising children in their later years, so as to avoid the situation of &quot;the children want to be raised but the parents don&#39;t wait&quot; regret. In this regard, some young people may make reasonable remarks, such as &quot;small family&quot;, &quot;independent space&quot; and &quot;border&quot;. If you have never accepted or asked for a large amount of financial support from your parents as an adult, and you have repaid your parents for their upbringing financially and emotionally, you may have the confidence to say this. But it is unjustifiable if you receive a large amount of financial support from your parents as an adult and then refuse to fulfill reciprocal responsibilities. According to natural law and customary law, parents have the right to assert their own rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, now is the era of smartphones and mobile Internet, and many public transportation services, government services, and convenience services have become online and digital. A considerable number of elderly people have been left far behind in this era and have become &quot;digitally disabled groups&quot;. They do not use mobile phones or use simple-function elderly machines, cannot understand how to use those apps, and do not know how to make electronic payments. On the one hand, the government and enterprises should reserve non-digital service channels for the elderly and provide them with guidance in a conspicuous way; on the other hand, the platform should demonstrate social responsibility and launch an &quot;aging-friendly&quot; APP version to make the operation quick, simple and convenient. Older people get started. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children should have patience and love for their digitally disabled parents, teach them to use the apps they need, or provide regular guidance and help, just like your parents patiently taught you ancient poems over and over again when you were a child. Like arithmetic, this is about feedback and feedback. In addition, parents should be alert to prevent telecommunications and network fraud, and should &quot;not give any personal information, do not give money, and do not cooperate with the other party in any operation.&quot; They should inform themselves when they have questions or before making major financial decisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, as body functions and organs continue to age, the vast majority of the elderly will experience a stage of disability, semi-disability or even dementia. The resulting need for medical care will have a negative impact on the lives of their children. constitute a great challenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The national elderly care strategy is &quot;9073&quot;, that is, 90% of the elderly are provided with home care, 7% are provided with community care, and 3% are provided with institutional care. A 2023 Beijing survey found that more than 99% of the elderly in Beijing choose home care, while less than 1% choose institutional care. Therefore, except for some completely disabled elderly people who are supported by the government, the vast majority of disabled elderly people still rely on their children to take care of them. Children generally have to contribute both money and effort, and the most important part is contribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disabled elderly people can only eat three meals a day in bed or in a wheelchair. If they lose the function of their hands or have dementia, they need to be fed, just like parents feeding themselves when they are one or two years old, and they must also help with defecation. , wipe your body or take a bath regularly; use a wheelchair to push outdoors on sunny days, so that the disabled elderly can enjoy the sunshine and breeze, feel happy and refresh their spirits; lying in bed for a long time, you must turn over regularly, otherwise the blood circulation will not be smooth, which will lead to vascular embolism or bedsores. ; If dementia is superimposed, it will be even more troublesome. Some elderly people will have delusions, become violent, and even smear feces all over the house, making it difficult to clean up. The odor will also attract complaints from neighbors... Disability and dementia For the elderly, it is generally impossible to hire a nanny to take care of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, as the mainstay of the family, you are in middle age, you have seniors and juniors, you have unlimited responsibilities on your shoulders, everyone relies on you and you have no one to rely on, this kind of pressure It&#39;s unprecedented. If you add a mid-life workplace crisis, it will be even more stressful. Therefore, as aging intensifies, this social problem will become more serious. But it is obviously difficult to solve this problem with a &quot;socialized&quot; system solution that transfers costs to society, unless robots are smart enough to replace human care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aging, two kinds of disability, and three major problems are all social problems that require serious consideration and treatment by the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[探访“山地之王”：高仙芝的高原足迹]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259129]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 20:55:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/23/9f8Kpn5eNv9GuiP2GOXSS097RDqjQpFK5sNsyUlf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/9f8Kpn5eNv9GuiP2GOXSS097RDqjQp FK5sNsyUlf. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254965&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Aerial view of the Pamir Mountains&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-August, I set off from Kashgar and cycled along the Karakoram Highway to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Since my country’s Khunjerab Port does not allow cycling to pass customs, I need to take a transit bus in Taxkorgan County, check the bicycle as luggage, and continue riding after arriving at Khunjerab National Park on the Pakistani side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Khunjerab Pass is 4,783 meters above sea level. On one side of the border with my country is the wide-open and wide-open valley terrain of the eastern Pamir Plateau. The climate is arid and the vegetation is sparse. It is rare to see a tree at the foot of the mountain. Surrounded by a courtyard wall - it is a family of Tajik herders; entering Pakistan, it quickly transforms into a valley terrain with surging rapids - this is a canyon cut by the Hunza River in the southeastern part of the Pamir Plateau. It collided left and right in the mountain knot formed by the intersection of the Karakoram Mountains, Himalayas and Hindu Kush Mountains, and fell rapidly. From the border line of Khunjerab Pass to the entrance of Khunjerab National Park where Pakistan conducts border inspection, it is a short 40-kilometer journey, and the altitude drops by about one thousand meters; from the border inspection to Sost, the Pakistani port ), a distance of about 38 kilometers, and the altitude has dropped by nearly a thousand meters - which is naturally great news for cyclists. By the time I rode all the way downhill to the Ganish village in the eastern part of the Hunza Valley, the altitude had dropped to about 2,400 meters, which was only half of the Khunjerab Pass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not far south of Ganish, I saw a pedestrian rope bridge flying north and south over the raging Hunza River, and a warm current suddenly surged in my heart - more than 1,200 years ago , Gao Xianzhi, a famous general in the Tang Dynasty, used a similar rope bridge in the lower reaches of this river to block the way of the fierce enemy troops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/xWctTRMmRc2MxiLpdWwLNYWZpCV4uwzyTRNSw53W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;763&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/xWctTRMmRc2MxiLpdWwLNYWZpCV4uwzyTRNSw53W.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254966&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A pedestrian rope bridge over the Hunza River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong >;Kashmir&#39;s &quot;Great Game&quot;: Smoke and dust flying to the west of Jinshan Mountain&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before Gao Xianzhi rushed to the rope bridge, the prospect of the expeditionary force he commanded was not good: facing a surrendering enemy The fortified city, as well as a large number of enemy reinforcements coming all the way, while our own army has been on the march for more than three months, traveled more than 1,500 kilometers, and faced the extremely harsh geological and climatic conditions in Congling (&lt;em>; After continuous fighting in the wind and snow, the lone expeditionary force advanced deeply into the enemy&#39;s territory. They did not understand the language, had no siege equipment, lacked logistical supplies, and could not get reinforcements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a difficult situation may have been encountered by Alexander the Great during his legendary expedition to Asia and Europe. However, Alexander stationed his troops to the west of Congling and never crossed over. Gao Xianzhi&#39;s mission was precisely to cross the Congling to regain the lost territory. What&#39;s more, his military strength, animal power and material resources were far less than Alexander&#39;s expeditionary force. This may be why Gao Xianzhi later He was called the &quot;King of the Mountains&quot; by one of his rivals, Sahib jibal al-Sin. Sahib is the Turkic word for &quot;master&quot; , jibal is &quot;mountain&quot; in Arabic, and al-Sin is of China)&lt;/span>; reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Xianzhi is a descendant of the Goguryeo royal family. His ancestors were the Fuyu people who emerged in the Hunjiang River Basin and the middle reaches of the Yalu River in Northeast China. &quot;Gao was their surname&quot; and established the Goguryeo regime during the Western Han Dynasty, which lasted seven hundred years. For a long time, it once occupied Liaodong to the southwest, and then crossed the Yalu River to the southeast and entered the Korean Peninsula. After the Goguryeo regime perished under the military attacks of the Sui and Tang dynasties, the Tang Dynasty moved the defeated Gao royal family to the Central Plains and Longyou. Gao Xianzhi followed his father Gao Sheji into the army and became a border guard in the Tang Dynasty. He grew up in the Hexi Corridor. He grew up in a military camp, and when he was a boy, he was transferred to the Anxi Protectorate with his father, which is today&#39;s southern Xinjiang, Pamir Plateau and Central Asia Hezhong region. He rose to prominence in his twenties and was promoted to general, the same level as his father. Later, he was further recognized by the leader of the Qiang people and the governor of Anxi, Meng Lingjin, and was promoted to deputy governor of Anxi and commander of the four towns. The horse envoy is equivalent to Fumeng Lingjin&#39;s deputy and the military chief of the entire southern Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the sixth year of Tianbao&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (747 AD)&lt;/span>;, Gao Xianzhi received an edict from Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, appointing him In order to serve as a military envoy, I made my fourth expedition to Congling after the failure of my three predecessors to recapture Xiaobolu - the Pakistani-controlled Kashmir where I rode to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/fKtCWOawnzDSfDbU6a8InBuv60cCYamb90OjqJHx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;579&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/fKtCWOawnzDSfDbU6a8InBuv60cCYamb90OjqJHx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254967&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cycling in Hunza, Pakistan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Gilgit-Baltistan) is divided into two parts, Gilgit and Baltistan. The origin of the division can be traced back to the Greater and Lesser Bulu. The original name of this place was Boloristan, which means &quot;mountain country&quot;, where &quot;stan&quot; means &quot;country&quot; in Turkic language. Today, there are five &quot;stan&quot; countries in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, and Pakistan in South Asia; Bolor means plateau and mountainous area - this place name is famous in the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty and is translated as &quot;Bolu&quot;. It is the junction area of ​​the four kingdoms of Tang, Tubo, Tianzhu and Dashi, and is divided into the western and western regions. Xiao Bolu in the Sa Valley and Big Bolu in the upper reaches of the Indus River in the east - the goal of Gao Xianzhi&#39;s expedition was Xiao Bolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Big and Little Bolu were originally one country, and their territory included most of today&#39;s Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and the northern part of Indian-controlled Kashmir. It was a must-win place for Tubo in its Western Region strategy. At the beginning of the seventh century, Tubo annexed the ancient Shangshung Kingdom in the Ali region and unified the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. From then on, it began to implement its Western Region strategy based on the Ali region, and launched a nearly two-year-long war with the Tang Dynasty around Bolu, that is, the Kashmir region. The &quot;Great Game&quot; between Tang and Tibet for centuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/BPoP6sb1xhgMaISzFXsrbGNTYIjafKo87zl8Qs4z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/BPoP6sb1xhgMaISzFXsrbGNTYIjafKo87zl8Qs4z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254969&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hunza Valley&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tubo is backed by the Himalayas. It borders the Tang Dynasty in three directions: north, east and south. Why do we have to choose Kashmir to decide the outcome? Tubo initially launched the main attack on Datang on the Hehuang and Jiannan fronts, but failed to open up the situation. After occupying the Ngari region, Tibet tried to seize southern Xinjiang via the northern Qiangtang Prairie and across the Altyn Mountains. After being blocked again, they had to turn to expand northwest along the Shiquan River/Indus River Basin, intending to bypass the Himalayas and enter through the Ladakh region. Kashmir eventually joined forces with the Western Turks in the north to deal with the Tang Dynasty. In short, Tubo was like a lion trapped on a high platform. It was attacked head-on by the Tang army in Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and Xinjiang. It was unable to get down to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In the end, it had to choose to go down the mountain from Kashmir, where there was no Tang army, and take a detour. Congling attacked the western border of Tang Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Belu Kingdom, located on this expansion route, became a &quot;soft persimmon&quot; that Tibet fought against with all its strength, and soon split into two countries: the Belu Homeland became a Tubo vassal state, known as &quot; The Great Burud&quot; was roughly located in today&#39;s Baltistan area; another royal family moved westward to the Hunza Valley and established the &quot;Little Burud&quot;, which was roughly located in today&#39;s Gilgit area, relying on the Hunza River and Gilgit The Te River&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(called Suyi River in ancient times)&lt;/span>; and the Indus River line up with deep valleys and natural chasms to resist the Tibetan invasion. King Xiao Bolu did not hesitate to send an envoy to ask for help from the Tang Dynasty, saying that Bolu was the gateway to the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty. If it fell, all the countries in the Western Regions would fall to Tubo, and the Western Regions would no longer be controlled by the Tang Dynasty&lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Bo Lu, Ximen of the Tang Dynasty. If he loses it, all the Western countries will fall to Tubo)&lt;/span>;, and was finally canonized by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty and became the Tang Dynasty Subject to the country. In the tenth year of Kaiyuan (722 AD), the Beiting Protectorate of the Tang Army sent 4,000 cavalry reinforcements to Xiaobolu to attack Xiaobolu. He repelled the attack of the Tibetan army and won nearly twenty years of peace for Xiaobolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 740 AD, Tubo instigated the Tuqishi Khanate in the northern grasslands to rebel against the Tang Dynasty through marriage, and contained the main force of the Tang army in the Western Regions in the northern Xinjiang. On this occasion, he proposed to Xiao Bolu to &quot;borrow a road&quot; and build a rope bridge on the Suyi River. The Tubo army, which successfully crossed the natural barrier of the Suyi River, immediately turned against the foreigners and occupied Xiaobolu. King Su Feng of Xiaobolu was forced to marry the Tibetan princess, and together with more than 20 surrounding small countries, they rebelled against Tang and surrendered to Tibet. The Tibetan army was able to occupy the entire Bolu and get a glimpse of Congling: they captured Lianyun Fort, the fortress of the Tang army guarding the Wakhan Valley, the main road to Congling, opening the way to the north to Central Asia to make friends with the Turks, and cutting off the capital of Anxi. The road from Hufu to the Zhaowu Kingdoms in the Hezhong region also formed a condescending military advantage over the four Anxi towns of the Tang Dynasty located in the Tarim Basin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the unfavorable situation that a gap was opened in the defense line of the Western Region, the Anxi Protectorate had to concentrate all its efforts in order to regain Bolu and block the &quot;downhill&quot; channel of Tubo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/bZT8JG7NjiRBsR7Doyj7Jnnki6xEICEQfr28g9Y1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/bZT8JG7NjiRBsR7Doyj7Jnnki6xEICEQfr28g9Y1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254970&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The barren and pure river valley in Hunza region&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;Recovering the Wakhan Valley: The captives should be frightened after hearing this&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the most convenient way to go from China&#39;s Pamir Plateau to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is to go south along the Hunza Valley, or That is to say, follow the Karakoram Highway, which was historically one of the important passages along the southern route of the Silk Road to South Asia. It’s just that in ancient times, caravans used to go through the Mingtie Gaidaban, and when China and Pakistan planned and built the Karakoram Highway in the 1960s, in order to avoid the military threat of the Soviet Union—Tajikistan, which today occupies most of the Pamir Plateau, was Afghanistan, a republic of the Soviet Union, was also under Soviet hostage at the time. The Soviet army deployed an army division in the Wakhan Valley and built missile launch sites and airports. It was eyeing my country&#39;s southern Xinjiang - so it chose the east of Mingtie Gaida Ban. , far away from the Sino-Soviet border and the Khunjerab Pass with complex mountains to achieve better strategic concealment. The cost is that the China-Pakistan Highway on the Pakistani side has a large gap and is easily damaged by natural disasters such as landslides and mudslides. For example, in 2010, a landslide formed a barrier lake, causing the China-Pakistan Highway to be interrupted for five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Gao Xianzhi went on an expedition to Xiaobolu, he neither took the Mingtiegaida Ban nor the Hongqilafu Pass, because this line of mountainous terrain was already controlled by the Tibetan army at that time. If he took these passes, it would be difficult. Faced with the huge risk of being attacked from the front and rear by the Tibetan army stationed in Lianyunbao, cutting off the food route. Therefore, what he chose was to first pull out Lianyunbao, the nail that was driven into the Congling Mountains, and then go south through the Yasin Valley parallel to it on the west side of the Hunza Valley, and attack Xiaobolu in a roundabout way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianyun Fort in the Tang Dynasty was located in Sarhad, the last village in eastern Afghanistan today. It guarded the east entrance of the Wakhan Valley, and continued eastward into the Sino-Afghan border area. desert areas. The Wakhan Valley, also known as the Penchi Valley or the Wakhan Corridor, is a valley between the Pamir Plateau and the Hindu Kush Mountains. It stretches more than 600 miles from east to west and is an important cultural passage in the history of China and India. An important part of the southern route of the Silk Road. Zhang Qian of the Han Dynasty &quot;emptied out the Western Region&quot; and went through Congling to the Hezhong area to search for the Dayue clan; nearly 120 years before Gao Xianzhi&#39;s expedition to Xiaobolu&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;(629 AD)&lt;/span>;, &quot;Tang Monk&quot; Xuanzang crossed the Wakhan Valley into South Asia after seven days and nights; the two great empires of Britain and Russia in modern times launched the &quot;Great Game&quot; in Central Asia, and finally used this As the dividing line and isolation zone between the north and the south, the valley demarcated the respective spheres of influence of the two countries, thus introducing the name &quot;Wakhan Corridor&quot;, and generously arbitrarily assigned this then Chinese territory to Afghanistan. It became an abrupt appendix at the eastern end of Afghanistan&#39;s territory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tibet defended the Lianyunbao Fortress at the east entrance of the Wakhan Valley, &quot;weaving wood into a city based on mountains and rivers, cuttings and cliffs in the valley&quot;. To the east, you can enter southern Xinjiang along the Taxkorgan Valley, and to the north you can cross The Pamir Plateau enters Central Asia. To the west, you can bypass the Hindu Kush Mountains and enter South Asia, or you can go to the Transoxiana region along the Pench River. To the south, you can rely on the Hindu Kush Mountains to protect the newly occupied Big and Little Burrows. It can be said that it is connected in all directions. , strategic location. In order to fight steadily, Gao Xianzhi must first clear out the Tubo advance position, and then go south to regain Xiaobolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was unable to go to the Wakhan Valley to visit Lianyunbao in person, so I had to first take the China-Pakistan Highway to reach the small Buludu city of Gilgit - today&#39;s capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Gilgit), and then walk along the Gao Xianzhi&#39;s march route went in the opposite direction, first going westward along the Gilgit River, then northward along its tributary Yasin Valley, and reaching the southern slope of the Hindu Kush Mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/ItRbcoHPJdl4kV2Y35bCnG8BbEqBsEmisEeqIQWS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/ItRbcoHPJdl4kV2Y35bCnG8BbEqBsEmisEeqIQWS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tashkorgan Stone City&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the old and new Tang books According to records, Gao Xianzhi commanded 10,000 infantry - equivalent to half of the mobile troops of the Anxi Protectorate - from Qiuci in the fourth lunar month of 747 AD >; (Today&#39;s Kuqa)&lt;/span>; Set out and spent more than a month along the southern foot of Tianshan Mountains via Diazhuangcheng &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s Aksu)&lt;/ span>;, hold Sede&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s Bachu)&lt;/span>; and go west to Shule&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Today&#39;s Kashgar)&lt;/span>;, and mobilized some border guard cavalry along the way, and then followed the Taxkorgan River Valley southward to Congling to guard the capture&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Shouchu&quot; is a small military town in the Tang Dynasty)&lt;/span>;, which is the stone city outside Taxkorgan County today - &quot;Tash&quot; means &quot;stone&quot; in Turkic language. In the first ten days of the seventh lunar month, the Tang army, together with about 20,000 vassal troops from the Western Regions, crossed the Congling Mountains and arrived at Telemanchuan&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now Khorog, Tajikistan )&lt;/span>;. Gao Xianzhi divided his troops into three groups here. He led the main force of the Tang army back to the west side of Lianyun Fort. He also sent two groups of troops from Kashgar and Aksu to surround Lianyunguo from the north and east respectively. It was agreed on the 13th day of the seventh lunar month. A surprise attack was launched at the same time at day and night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historical records show that the Tubo army held on to the mountain and rolled logs and stones to &quot;cover the sky&quot;, making it difficult for the Tang army to succeed. Gao Xianzhi issued a strict order to his brave generals Li Siye and Tian Zhen: &quot;If we don&#39;t reach the sun, we must break the enemy!&quot;. The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; once wrote a biography of Li Siye, saying that he was born in the military and was &quot;seven feet long and extremely brave.&quot; Facing the intensive defense of the defenders, he and Tian Zhen held the double-edged Mo Dao and led a troop of Mo Dao soldiers. The commando team found another way and &quot;climbed first at the most dangerous place&quot;, that is, climbed up from the cliff that the Tubo defenders did not expect, and rushed into the enemy&#39;s stronghold from a high position. As expected, they captured the building before noon, which was garrisoned by more than 10,000 Tubo troops. , a fortress with a compound defense system composed of mountain fortresses and mountain foot camps, beheaded 5,000 people, captured more than 1,000 people, and won the largest tough battle of the expedition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tang army recaptured Lianyun Fort, drove the Tubo out of Congling, and regained the Wakhan Valley, the passage connecting the Western Regions. The next step was to cross the Hindu Kush Mountains, recapture Xiaobolu, and clear out the The threat of the Tibetan army to the Wakhan Valley. It was mid-August at that time. Today&#39;s Wakhan Corridor is only passable from June to August of the year. The mountains are blocked by heavy snow at other times. The climate in the Tang Dynasty was also the same. Presumably considering the weather factors, Gao Xianzhi did not delay at Lianyun Fort, leaving more than 3,000 weak soldiers behind. He led his elite infantry to march lightly and quickly, and ran for three days and nights, arriving at Darkut Pass (Darkut Pass, &lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Today&#39;s translation is Dakot Pass). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/8kscrApbrsiJFCskX9KcLqRJ1jVIPF19O4ElMSvA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/8kscrApbrsiJFCskX9KcLqRJ1jVIPF19O4ElMSvA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wakhan Corridor, with the Hindu Kush Mountains in the background. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Crossing the Hindu Kush: The vast sea is covered with hundreds of feet of ice&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Pakistan and Afghanistan are bounded by the Hindu Kush Mountains in the Wakhan Corridor. This Persian name was first seen in the narrative of the medieval Arab traveler Ibn Battuta. It is literally translated as &quot;Hindu (Hindu Kush)&quot;. &quot;Hindu&quot; killer (Kush)&quot;, which means that a large number of Indian slaves captured from the hot areas of South Asia froze to death while crossing this high and cold mountain; some people also interpret it as the &quot;Mountain of India&quot;, which means crossing southward This mountain range enters the Indian subcontinent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tanjuling Pass is located in the eastern section of the Hindu Kush Mountains, but it is not a pass that runs through this mountain range - because there are two watersheds and two mountain passes here. The eastern end of the Hindu Kush Mountains originates from the Pamir Plateau and has the characteristics of mountain twists and turns. It is divided into parallel north and south branches near the Tanju Ridge: the north branch is the border line between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and south of the south branch is the north and south branches. The Yasin River Valley runs east-west, while the Yarkhun River runs east-west between the north and south branches. Tanjuling Pass is a pass on the South Branch, with an altitude of 4688 meters. There are glaciers on both sides of the pass, making it difficult to cross. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So is there any other way? In fact, there is. After crossing the northern branch of the Hindu Kush Mountains, you can go west along the Yakun Valley, bypass the southern branch, and then cross the famous Shandur Pass (Shandur) eastward into the Gilgit Valley, and then you can go down the river to Xiaobo. law. However, this route is still extremely rugged and difficult to travel today in the 21st century. There are no paved roads in the Yaquin Valley. Most of the road sections are simple gravel roads located on steep cliffs and halfway up the mountain, and can only accommodate one vehicle passing through at low speeds.

The Tibetan reinforcements were already waiting in Xiaobolu Yiyi, and the Hindu Kush Mountains and the Pamir Plateau would soon be It will be impassable due to the severe cold, which means that the Tang army&#39;s return route will be cut off - I guess this is why Gao Xianzhi decided to race against time and led his army to risk crossing the Tanjuling Pass &quot;straight down for more than forty miles.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the soldiers who serve as soldiers and eat food do not have such strategic insight. After finally climbing up the ice and snow to Tanju Ridge, they looked at the rolling glaciers at their feet and asked Gao Xianzhi in panic: &quot;Where does the ambassador want me to go?&quot; - &quot;Ambassador&quot; is the honorific title given to Jiedushi in the Tang Dynasty - —Do you want us to slide down from the top of such a steep glacier? Are you taking us to Little Bolu or Yama Hall? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thousands of years ago, Stein, a British-Hungarian explorer, wrote after an on-site inspection of Gao Xianzhi’s march route: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I stood From the shimmering snow at the top of the mountain pass, peering down to the steep slopes that lead to the end of the Yasin Valley at 6,000 feet, we can understand why the Tang army refused to move forward at first, how difficult it was for them to struggle forward later, and how brave Gao Xianzhi was. clear! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/QmEoteO6T3NeHWtoJELvU9xOW5FmFYpLIBb5Wihg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1200&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/QmEoteO6T3NeHWtoJELvU9xOW5FmFYpLIBb5Wihg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tanjuling&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Gao Xianzhi Soldiers cannot be driven by personal bravery. He anticipated the weakness of human nature and knew that soldiers did not dare to climb the ice and go deep into the enemy&#39;s territory, so he quietly sent more than 20 of his trusted aides, dressed in Berrut clothing, to climb up Tanju Ridge in advance to wait for the large army. While the soldiers of the Tang Dynasty were wondering on the top of the mountain, these impostors came forward with smiles, claiming to be the defenders of Xiaobolu stationed opposite the mountain pass. They came to surrender to the king on behalf of the defenders of Anuyue City. Bo Lu has cut off the only way for Tibetan reinforcements to pass. This great (&lt;em>;false&lt;/em>;) news made the soldiers of the Tang Dynasty suddenly feel that victory was in sight, so they obeyed the general&#39;s order with confidence and crossed Tanju Ridge and entered the Yasin Valley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to historians’ research, Anuyue City is located in today’s Gupis Town, where the Yasin River merges into the Gilgit River. The biggest pass on the way to the capital. I cycled along the paved road from Gilgit to Chitral. When a primary school on the roadside was getting out of school, three to five hundred girls wearing black hijabs happily poured out of the school gate&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(local boys and girls each attend half-day school)&lt;/span>;, which temporarily blocked the road. After they dispersed into the streets, I saw the chain bridge built with Chinese aid on the north side of the highway across the fast-flowing Gilgit River. After crossing the bridge and going up the river a short distance away, I could see a clear tributary flowing from the northwest. Entering the big river, it is the Yasin River, which is formed by melting snow from Tanjuling Glacier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/a3WXffZ5FQu5EWQchTj2pAmrlpm6JAxX4OpDzaI8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/a3WXffZ5FQu5EWQchTj2pAmrlpm6JAxX4OpDzaI8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254974&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Yasin Valley under Tanju Ridge&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conga The total distance from Nuyue City to the southern foot of Tanju Ridge at the source of the Yasin River is nearly 70 kilometers. It is also an unpaved simple dirt road. It took me three hours to arrive by car. Gao Xianzhi led his army over the mountains and ridges. Four days. When there was only one day left on the mountain road, good news came: Anuyue City had really sent an envoy to greet the Tang army. Perhaps the guard knew that the main force of the Tibetan army had been gathered and annihilated in Lianyun Fort, and the Tang army had crossed the dangerous Tanju Ridge. The Suyi River could no longer stop its troops, so they decided to surrender to the Tang Army in Kaicheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what came to my mind was another scene: the Tang army soldiers looked at the two groups of Hu people in surprise. They both claimed to be the defenders of Anuyue City, and both claimed to be surrendering, but each other I don’t know each other, and I can’t communicate with them. The latter group had a Persian look, with their high noses and deep eyes, but the former group looked similar to me. They spoke in a nonsensical way and looked at each other awkwardly...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Cut the Indus Valley: Ximen, the charioteer, stands to show off his victory&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starting from Anuyue City, go east along the Suyi River to Niduo, the capital city of Xiaobolu, the distance is about One hundred and ten kilometers. Niduo City is located at the intersection of the Hunza Valley and the Sui River Valley. The original site of the city is unknown, but according to historical records, it should be located on the west bank of the Sui River. Today it is Gilgit, the capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and is named after the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About sixty miles further down the Sui River from Niduo City is the mouth of the Sui River where it merges into the Indus River. From there, going down the Indus River is what was known in ancient times as the &quot;Land of Five Rivers&quot;. &quot;Punjab Plain&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Punjab&quot; means &quot;Five Rivers&quot; in Hindi)&lt;/span>; - the five rivers originate from the Himalayas The tributaries at the southern foot of the mountain range merge into the Indus River one after another, forming a fertile alluvial plain that gave birth to ancient Indian civilization. From here, you can go upstream and pass through the spectacular grand canyon from the river mouth to Skardu. You can enter Dabolu and finally cross the Himalayas to reach the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Karakoram Highway goes south along the platform on the right side of the Hunza River, Gilgit River and Indus River, taking a beautiful U-shaped bend near the mouth of the Gilgit River and descending to the shore. Then cross the Gilgit River through a road bridge, and on the other side is Highway S1, which leads along the Indus River to the India-Pakistan confrontation area in Kashmir. Its strategic value is very important. During Gao Xianzhi&#39;s expedition, a rope bridge made of rattan was built where the highway bridge is now. It was built by Tibet by tricking Xiao Bolu into &quot;borrowing the road&quot;. It is &quot;one arrow wide&quot;, which means that the span of the vine bridge reaches the archery range of the time - about two hundred meters. This vine bridge is the only way for the Tibetan army to pass from Dabolu to Xiaobolu and even north to Congling. It can be said to be the key to the throat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it was said that Gao Xianzhi led his army to Niduo City, and the Xiaobolu nobles who were loyal to Tibet held on to the capital and refused to let the Tang army enter the city. Gao Xianzhi fell into the dilemma described at the beginning of this article: if Niduo City is not captured as soon as possible, once the Tibetan reinforcements arrive, the Tang army, which has lost its retreat, will inevitably fall into a pincer attack from both sides and be surrounded and annihilated under Niduo City in the coming severe winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Gao Xianzhi did not assume the posture of attacking the city - of course, he did not have the manpower and material resources to storm the fortified city. The top commander of the expeditionary force first sent an envoy to stabilize King Xiaobolu, claiming that the Tang army neither planned to attack the city nor destroy the Tengqiao, but intended to pass through the Tengqiao to attack the Tibetan army of Dabolu; secondly, he used The gold and silver property lured the pro-Tibet nobles who guarded the city, and tricked them into the Tang camp and beheaded them all; and the most important task, Gao Xianzhi handed over to the pioneer Xi Yuanqing: rush to the mouth of the Suyi River to destroy the Tengqiao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The road from Niduo City to the mouth of the Suyi River was a military road laid by the Tibetan army. The road condition must be good, but by the time Xi Yuanqing marched sixty miles to Tengqiao, the sun had already set on the snow peak on the west side of the canyon. behind. In the deep dusk, he saw a flock of birds flying in the mountains opposite, and smoke and dust rising up - that was another army coming at full speed. Xi Yuanqing didn&#39;t waste any time and immediately ordered his soldiers to cut off the cane together. As soon as Tengqiao fell into the extremely fast Suyi River, which the ancients called weak water, a large group of Tibetan reinforcements rushed to the other side. Unfortunately, it was too late to cross the river. GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;: It was late in the evening, and it was just cut. The Tubo soldiers and horses arrived, and it was no longer possible). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/PnJOz5W8HdgAwZ8xG3Di00h5CaRC2mXr2W1STqHx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/PnJOz5W8HdgAwZ8xG3Di00h5CaRC2mXr2W1STqHx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254976&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The fast-flowing Suyi River is also called weak water. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This vine bridge took a year to build.

The defeat of Xiaobolu King Su suddenly became the party that was besieged on all sides and had to surrender to Gao Xianzhi. The king and his Tibetan queen were sent to Chang&#39;an as prisoners, while Xiao Bolu was renamed the Quy Nhon Army and guarded here by a thousand Tang troops. The entire battle to recapture Xiaobolu lasted four months, but the actual combat process lasted only more than ten days. Except for the half-day bloody battle at Lianyun Castle, it could be said that the victory was achieved without any bloodshed in Xiaobolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stein once commented: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A large number of armies passed through the Pamirs and Hindu Kush.

Two years later, the new Anxi Jiedushi Feng Changqing, the successor he single-handedly promoted from Cao Mang, sent troops to recapture Dabolu, thereby completely cutting off the Tibetan invasion of the four towns of Anxi via Bolu and Congling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this battle was the last expansion of the Tang Dynasty in the Western Regions. Only two years later, the Anshi Rebellion broke out, and the Central Plains fell into raging war. The Tang Dynasty, which was on the verge of extinction, was no longer able to manage the Western Regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, Tubo also changed its strategy against the Tang Dynasty. When faced with the strong troops of the Tang Dynasty, it detoured to Bolu to attack one of its four towns in Anxi. Instead, it used the Tang Dynasty to repeatedly mobilize Hexi elites to quell rebellions in the interior, which led to local rebellions. With the opportunity of empty troops, they resumed their main attack on the Hehuang area, seizing the Hexi Corridor connecting the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty and the Central Plains, and then defeated the towns and countries in the Western Regions that had lost contact and were isolated. The ruling system of the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty collapsed. By the beginning of the ninth century, the Anxi Protectorate had completely fallen, and the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains were not re-incorporated into the territory of my country until the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, it was called &quot;Xinjiang&quot;, which means &quot;new return to the homeland&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why Gao Xianzhi was transferred out of the Western Regions at the height of his military power, that is another story of ups and downs. &lt;p>; The two moved to the Western Regions and traveled all over the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[制造数字人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259222]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[李尚福被免去国务委员、国防部部长职务，秦刚被免去国务委员职务]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259226]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 19:19:58&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;3270835011391102109&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Xi Jinping signed Presidential Order No. 12, No. 13, and No. 14.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud. com/48276b87vodtransgzp1251434507/35d229ad3270835011391102109/sampleSnapshot/sampleSnapshot_10_0.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp12514 34507/35d229ad3270835011391102109/DQLOOyhweoEA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640 &quot; height=&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/35d229ad3270835011391102109/DQLOOyhweoEA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;According to CCTV&#39;s &quot;News Network&quot;, Chairman&#39;s Order No. 14 said that according to the decision of the Sixth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People&#39;s Congress of the People&#39;s Republic of China on October 24, 2023:&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;1.

Many old communities have few public spaces, making it difficult to build senior care canteens, care centers, etc.; most community senior care stations operate in a &quot;small workshop&quot; business model, lacking industry-influential business entities; there is still a shortage of senior care nursing talents, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Multiple parties share the responsibility to allow the elderly to spend their old age peacefully &quot;at home&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Strengthening the Work on Aging in the New Era&quot; proposed that &quot;building coordinated home-based community institutions , an elderly care service system and a health support system that combine medical care and health care” and “promote the gathering of various high-quality service resources to the elderly’s side, home and surroundings.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/acbb9f4950eac6f42eaf4ffa3216b614.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;809&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/acbb9f4950eac6f42eaf4ffa3216b614.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255021&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Elderly people are having lunch at the Comprehensive Elderly Care Service Center in Xijiao Street, Kongtong District, Pingliang City, Gansu Province. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Zixuan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Where there are many elderly people, we will set up elderly care service institutions.” The Ministry of Civil Affairs and other departments stated that during the “14th Five-Year Plan” period, they will promote the development of old urban areas and completed residential areas. The (community) district has basically completed the community elderly care service facilities, and promoted the construction of a &quot;15-minute&quot; home elderly care service circle in urban communities, making home community elderly care services richer, more convenient, and of higher quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jiazeng, president of the Zhejiang Elderly Service Industry Association, believes that the focus of rural elderly care services should be on the provision of social services for people with disabilities and dementia. It is necessary to strengthen assistance and assistance to low-income groups, accelerate the establishment of a long-term care insurance system, give full play to the network advantages of township health centers and rural doctors, and encourage rural doctors to provide regular physical examinations, home visits, home hospital beds, etc. for the elderly, seriously ill, disabled and other elderly groups. Basic services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Hanqiao, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, suggested encouraging social capital to enter the elderly care industry, cultivating diversified business entities, and jointly making the elderly care service industry bigger and stronger. At present, Beijing has explored the establishment of a unified information platform for elderly care services to smooth resource docking, supply and demand matching, and support and guide business entities to actively participate in elderly care services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to problems such as the shortage of elderly care talents, Ding Fujun, director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of Shangyu District, Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province, suggested improving the treatment of nursing staff and increasing the public’s recognition of nursing staff. At the same time, we will guide the majority of social welfare organizations, charities, and young volunteers to participate in elderly care services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, we must vigorously promote the application and digital management of smart devices to empower elderly care services. At present, some places are already exploring this aspect. For example, Hangzhou City has carried out a housing protection project, and installed intelligent monitoring equipment such as smoke alarms and emergency callers on demand for aging-appropriate renovation objects; Changsha City has carried out targeted aging-appropriate renovation projects. Some elderly people are equipped with &quot;anti-lost&quot; technology clothing, sleep monitors and other smart devices, and their health data are synchronized to the cloud in real time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[1840年以来的中国与美国（中）丨倬彼云汉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259193]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/24/t0J4qtLpFTF6UmbRCvw4UEB36ori63tp3iVUJbVg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;962&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/t0J4qtLpFTF6UmbRCvw4UEB36ori63tp 3iVUJbVg. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255064&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The international landscape under the &quot;containment policy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1949, the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan. During this period, the United States conducted an in-depth review and determined its national policy: How to prevent and block the joint front between the Soviet Union and China? How should the so-called &quot;free world&quot;, that is, Europe and the United States led by Britain and the United States, face the socialist lineup? Will countries advocating a capitalist free economy and countries pursuing a socialist planned economy coexist peacefully, or will they be in constant confrontation? This was something the U.S. government was very concerned about at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1947, President Truman adopted a containment policy after consulting Marshall, Eisenhower and MacArthur on the above issues. On February 22, 1946, George F. Kennan, Charge d&#39;Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, sent the famous &quot;Long Telegram&quot; to the State Department. Kennan&#39;s suggestion established the United States&#39; plan for the postwar world: the &quot;Strategy of Containment.&quot; From the Truman era to the Nixon era, various diplomatic measures were taken in this direction. During the Nixon era, Kissinger planned the &quot;Engagement&quot; policy. However, from the overall principle, &quot;connection&quot; is only a means, trying to break out a gap in the &quot;containment&quot;. Therefore, the &quot;containment policy&quot; can be said to be the highest principle for the United States to deal with world affairs for decades. Until recently, this policy evolved into a frantic situation that was not anticipated at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back from 1947 to the present, for more than seventy years, most of the Western world has been ruled by this &quot;containment policy&quot;: the United States hopes that it should take on the role of &quot;free world&quot; and &quot;free economy&quot; defender&quot; responsibility. All possible &quot;gaps&quot; must be plugged as much as possible - extending from the North Sea to the Sea of ​​Okhotsk, and from Berlin to Sakhalin. This long front was dominated by the Soviet Union, and China, as an unspecified &quot;partner&quot; - which side China&#39;s &quot;partner&quot; status was on, was not stated in this cable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the implementation of this policy, the United States decided to use the three important figures mentioned above as the main executors. The first step was for Marshall, as Secretary of State, to preside over the &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; (officially known as the &quot;European Recovery Program&quot;) aimed at promoting European recovery, and at the same time use US dollars to assist Greece and Turkey - these two countries are The Soviet fleet entered the Mediterranean Sea from the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. In the East, after Japan surrendered, MacArthur wanted to build Japan and South Korea into &quot;the democratic fortresses of the East&quot; and personally preside over the defense of the Eastern Front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Truman retired, Eisenhower took over, and the three maintained this situation for decades. One of the episodes was that Truman could not stand that MacArthur &quot;would not be ordered by the king&quot; and recalled this warrior from South Korea. However, Marshall and Eisenhower faithfully implemented this policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first step of this policy in the East was that the U.S. Seventh Fleet began patrolling the Taiwan Strait, allowing Kinmen and Matsu, the two remaining bases of the Kuomintang Taiwan authorities, to be isolated on the coast of mainland China. preservation. Qingdao was originally a naval base for the US military stationed in China, but the Americans withdrew before they were actually involved in the battlefield on China&#39;s mainland. Otherwise, the US military stationed in Qingdao will echo the US military stationed in South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This decision triggered a series of changes in East Asia. The United States strengthens its bases in the Philippines and uses Japan and Ryukyu as important strongholds in the United States&#39; eastern defense line. Together with Taiwan, it forms the &quot;first island chain&quot; to contain mainland China. This policy has been maintained for a long time, implemented vigorously, and has far-reaching influence until today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the United States has refused to communicate with mainland China. Even though the &quot;Republic of China&quot; was forced to withdraw from the United Nations in 1971, the United States still maintained relations with it until 1978, when Beijing and Washington formally established diplomatic relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Cold War began, defending Taiwan became one of the tasks of the United States. As far as the Taiwan authorities are concerned, without the &quot;reassurance&quot; of the United States - the United States has drawn its defense line in the Taiwan Strait - the construction of this base in Taiwan would not have been possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The grievances and grievances between Taiwan and the mainland on the other side of the Taiwan Strait cannot be resolved to this day. How will these disputes be resolved in the future? How can we &quot;reunify&quot;? How can the results of Taiwan&#39;s construction, Taiwan&#39;s talents, Taiwan&#39;s economic foundation, and the mainland&#39;s economic construction support each other? This depends on the wisdom of us Chinese people, thinking about how to take into account the Chinese blood. Of course, the DPP and I have different ideas regarding the words &quot;Chinese blood.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have supported each other in economic construction, and this has not stopped since the 1970s. Mainland China&#39;s economic construction is about twenty years later than Taiwan&#39;s, because it experienced thirty years of bumps caused by trying various policies. From the time when Deng Xiaoping came to power to today, the cooperation and communication between the two sides has been carried out by the Straits Affairs Committee of both sides as the &quot;bridge&quot;, and by foreign heads of state such as Lee Kuan Yew as the &quot;middleman&quot;. Before Hong Kong and Macao returned to China, they were natural points of contact between the two sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second very important thing is the institutional reform of Taiwan initiated by Chiang Ching-kuo. He declared: &quot;We, the Chiang family, will no longer be involved in politics.&quot; Later, Lee Teng-hui changed Taiwan&#39;s basic law. But paradoxically, the U.S. government continues to promise to &quot;defend Taiwan with all its strength.&quot; This statement has become a rare example in the history of international relations. People familiar with international affairs once described this arrangement as &quot;intentional ambiguity.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chinese history, from the Spring and Autumn Period to the Warring States Period, the Jin State was the de facto leader of the &quot;Five Hegemons&quot;. Jin took possession of the cognac of its ally Weiguo. The hegemony of the Jin State was already declining at that time, and its interior was eventually divided among the three families of Korea, Zhao, and Wei. Chinese history entered the &quot;Seven Heroes&quot; era of the Warring States Period. At that time, those who really had the strength to compete for hegemony were the two marginal powers, Qin and Chu. The two hegemons Wu and Yue that appeared in the gap were just short-lived. The two marginal powers, Qin and Chu, competed. In the end, Qin unified China and became the predecessor of the &quot;Chinese Empire&quot;. The process of Qin&#39;s unification of the Central Plains and the system it established actually restricted the form of the Chinese Empire for two thousand years, and it was only changed in 1911. Here, I use this example from Chinese history to foresee possible future changes in the hegemony of the United States over the past few decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the establishment of U.S. hegemony, East Asia has encountered many crises: a Korean War and two Vietnam Wars - Japan and South Korea have become de facto &quot;dependencies&quot; of the United States, and Okinawa&#39;s status has become unclear. white. And these are all the consequences of the &quot;containment policy.&quot; The United States was so hegemonic that it could do the same thing in other countries that the Jin State obtained the cognac of the Wei State - Cognac was a stronghold in the eastern half of the Central Plains at that time, and the Jin State could not command the northern half. This situation is very similar to the &quot;island chain&quot; situation in East Asia. Paradoxically, the Zhao State, which was separated from the Jin State, finally took away the Cognac. We cannot predict whether the United States will transform Taiwan into an &quot;extension&quot; of Japan and South Korea in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look at the situation in Europe. After the &quot;Marshall Plan&quot;, the United States established NATO and the European Union, focusing on the three countries of Britain, France, and Germany—the past enemy Germany—to guard the heart of Europe. Decades later, the European Union now feels that the United States was there to protect them, but now the United States has become their master. The United States spent a lot of effort to defend Europe. The &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; really rebuilt a world full of flowers and flowers from the ruins. Today&#39;s Germany has a prosperous economic foundation that is different from the United States we see today - Britain and France were defeated, and Germany came up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the war, the United States divided Germany into two: half occupied by the West and half occupied by the Soviet Union - just like North Korea was divided into South Korea, South Vietnam and North Vietnam. Berlin is an independent city, and a &quot;Berlin Wall&quot; was built in the middle. During the first Berlin Crisis in 1948, the Soviet Union blocked Berlin. The United States airdropped food, hamburgers, hot dogs, milk, eggs and even paper and other daily necessities for several months. The planes never stopped on the runway. That&#39;s a staggering expense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 25, 1963, Kennedy gave a speech in Berlin - &quot;As a free man, I am extremely proud to say: I am a Berliner.&quot; After becoming president, Kennedy also said: We Don&#39;t forget that Churchill and our old President Roosevelt once proposed that human beings should have &quot;four freedoms.&quot; (The &quot;Atlantic Charter&quot; signed by Roosevelt and Churchill actually has two &quot;versions&quot;: one is a long &quot;treaty&quot;, and the other is a short slogan of the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; - freedom from fear, freedom from want , freedom of speech, freedom of belief.) It is our unshirkable duty to be the guardians of the world and safeguard these &quot;four freedoms.&quot; Back then, Kennedy swore an oath based on the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot;: Our mission is long and arduous. Don’t ask what the country can do for us, ask what we can do for the country. After President Roosevelt implemented the New Deal, the country fulfilled its responsibilities to its citizens and maintained their minimum standard of living. The responsibility of our government is to realize the &quot;four freedoms&quot; on American soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These declarations are very touching, and Americans are indeed working very hard in practice. The boundaries drawn at the time still exist today - the recent conflict between Ukraine and Russia was caused by the US &quot;containment policy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I said above is to explain the cultural background of Kennan’s “containment policy”, the United States’ expectations of itself, and its efforts. From then to now, for more than seventy years, the hegemony of the United States has been presented under the discourse system of &quot;containment policy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was also the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Soviet Union wanted to set up a missile base in Cuba, but the United States would not allow it. Kennedy and Khrushchev confronted each other and refused to give in. Eventually the Soviet Union gave in and withdrew its missiles from Cuba. The United States still occupies Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and refuses to give it up until death: it is a prison without legal control. The spies and prisoners the United States interrogates here are not protected by any human rights laws and are forced to water and whip. , electric shock and other torture, and the body was thrown away after death. I often use the word &quot;paradox&quot; to describe this kind of behavior: the United States claims to safeguard the &quot;four freedoms&quot;, but in fact there is always such a &quot;scar&quot;, but it turns a blind eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1957, mankind’s first artificial satellite was successfully launched by the Soviet Union. The United States spent a lot of money and tried hard to maintain the balance of power in space. Finally, in 1969, during the Nixon era, American astronauts landed on the moon for the first time. The year before, 59 countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, jointly signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Restricting new countries from developing nuclear weapons is a good thing for the world. As for countries that already possess nuclear weapons, it is unknown whether someone will use nuclear bombs first. Until the Reagan era, the arms competition between the United States and the Soviet Union continued, and even developed to the point where satellites could be used to carry nuclear bombs into space. The United States crushed the Soviet economy with its huge space arms race. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The previous description of U.S. foreign policy in history is used as a background to illustrate that U.S. foreign policy is the most important &quot;medicine&quot; in Sino-U.S. relations and is also intended to maintain the hegemonic thinking of Western culture and &quot;Containment&quot; thoughts. This is a very important principle for us to understand the complex chess game of the world since World War II. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Chinese in the United States under &quot;McCarthyism&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since World War II, many Chinese students have studied in the United States, including me. We come here to study because the curriculum and equipment of American schools are among the best in the world. At this stage, the United States is indeed recruiting a large number of foreign students, and we take this opportunity to learn skills. Of course, Chinese people like to return fallen leaves to their roots. Most of the hundreds of international students who came to the United States through the &quot;Geng Geng&quot; funds in the early days returned to China, and their main jobs were either in education or industry. At that time, China&#39;s scientific and technological development was not yet mainstream, and scientific and technological talents were roughly distributed in the above two categories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the war, with the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, China was divided into two and the straits were blocked. This became a big problem: under the &quot;containment policy&quot; stance of the &quot;containment policy&quot;, the United States would not allow students from mainland China to They return to the mainland. The most important example is Qian Xuesen. At that time, American physics was at the forefront of the world. If China wanted to develop modern technological weapons, Qian Xuesen&#39;s participation would definitely make a contribution. I believe Qian Xuesen did his best in inventing missiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; began to fall, the United States began to be suspicious of &quot;left-leaning&quot; people in the United States. This incident occurred during Truman&#39;s term. &quot;McCarthyism&quot; not only wanted to block those intellectuals who chose to return to China or Eastern European countries, but also wanted to eradicate &quot;left-leaning&quot; elements in the country. The so-called &quot;left leaning&quot; is defined as &quot;liberal elements&quot; - anyone who is not &quot;right&quot; is labeled as &quot;left&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person mainly responsible for this matter is the Pacific International Society. Their surveillance network is very wide and covers all the bases for China research-Pittsburgh is okay because it is not a big base. Such a situation has made Chinese people all over the United States fearful. One day, agents from the FBI or CIA will check your correspondence and check your tax payments. Everyone was in disbelief and fearful. When I came to Pittsburgh in 1970, I saw the remnants of this phenomenon. An old overseas Chinese named Yu - he changed his name to &quot;Lin Pan&quot; when he came here because he bought the Lin family&#39;s &quot;birth certificate&quot;; our current dentist belongs to the Yu family. The old gentleman came to my office to talk. He closed the door first, then gently talked to me about their fears, and asked me in a low voice: &quot;When will this situation end?&quot; Because they have many children from their hometown who want to come out. But the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; has dropped; there are still dozens of fellow villagers who died in foreign lands, so they have to be cremated first and wait until one day to take them back to their hometowns. Recently, Quanzi also visited the location where the ashes are stored, and there were indeed dozens of jars there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, &quot;McCarthyism&quot; was subsided, and Taiwan resumed exchanges with the United States. I returned to Taiwan in 1962 and spent the next two or three years working in the History Department of my alma mater, National Taiwan University, arranging courses according to the modern scale and direction. My main job was to liaise with academic institutions and sinologists in the United States. My supervisors are Mr. Wang Shijie, president of Academia Sinica, and Mr. Li Ji, director of the Institute of History and Philology. This job is very difficult, and many people question my position: If we go to Taiwan, will it increase the United States&#39; suspicion of me? I said: &quot;I can&#39;t answer your question, but I went back, and I have no problem.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until 1971, after Nixon launched &quot;ping pong diplomacy&quot; with mainland China, that there were a large number of overseas Chinese Young people and international students returned to the mainland; subsequently, a large number of international students came from the mainland as well, more than ten times more than those from Taiwan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Wcb0MkQeDfGn11pLogqeywCkeBau6ADMYXoj9kSS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;709&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Wcb0MkQeDfGn11pLogqeywCkeBau6ADMYXoj9kSS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255065&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1956, Mr. Yang Zhenning and Li Zhengdao proposed the &quot;law of non-conservation of parity&quot;; subsequently, Ms. Wu Jianxiong proved this theory through experiments - these three are world-famous physicists. Because Mr. Yang&#39;s father was still in the mainland, he went back as soon as Sino-US relations loosened, and has never cut off contacts with the mainland since then. He also worked very hard to introduce the research situation of modern physics in the United States to China and help domestic scholars. For decades, he has helped many students study abroad based on his original intention and done his best for the development of physics in mainland China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I had the honor to work with him and Liu Zunyi to help Mr. Yu Jizhong establish the &quot;Chinese-English Teaching Foundation&quot; in mainland China. The purpose is to help university teachers go abroad for as short as half a year or as long as one year. Further education. As long as they put forward the visiting unit, goals, plans, time, as well as an invitation letter or commitment from the United States, as well as a letter of recommendation from the school, we will try our best to prioritize them in a professional direction. It is a very pleasant job for me to see so many outstanding scholars lining up, ready to make further efforts. Unfortunately, there are too few people and we cannot satisfy everyone&#39;s wishes. Because of this work, Mr. Yang meets with us once a year. In addition to our lectures to various schools, I also had the opportunity to ask for advice from him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, we visited the Chinese University of Hong Kong at the same time, and we would often drink tea and chat together. With such a friendship, I admire him greatly: he is old but still childlike, smart but not overbearing. He has reached the pinnacle of his specialized knowledge and is very knowledgeable about general affairs. The most admirable thing: He is completely frank with juniors of my age, which makes me feel like I am sitting on a spring breeze when talking to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
