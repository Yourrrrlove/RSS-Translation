The United States lost about 4.5 million soldiers in the Korean War, which was unprecedented in American history; and the United States did not get any benefits from the two Vietnam Wars. The two Vietnam Wars lasted for almost thirty years together. It lasted for a long time, especially the second time the United States retreated from Vietnam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poison gas is not used in war. This is an international convention. During World War II, this principle was observed between the United States and Germany and between the United States and Japan. However, the Japanese often used poison gas on the Chinese battlefield. The United States also used poison gas during the Vietnam War. Today, among Vietnamese children, there are deformed and dystocia babies. The poison gas that the United States spread in the forests of Vietnam is still permeating the air. This is all evil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;587&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255338&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Soviet control Within the scope, some countries in Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe made several attempts to break away from the Soviet bloc. Every time this happened, the CIA was deeply involved, causing turmoil. Some of the consequences were national restructuring and the emergence of new regimes, but the only regimes that could maintain stability were the Hungarian Spring and the Polish Spring (the Poznan Incident in June 1956 and the Hungarian Incident in October 1956). In addition, the &quot;color revolutions&quot; in a string of Muslim countries on the Mediterranean coast in the Middle East, such as Egypt, Algeria, and Libya, have always destroyed the original order; and the economic construction that those countries had started has almost stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a geopolitical perspective, the Middle East is a battleground, and this region is also the largest oil-producing area in the world. The United States has tried its best to control it, starting with controlling Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia was an independent emirate that the British separated from the Persian Empire. Later, it became a &quot;wealthy rich man&quot; with a hereditary chief, but it became the &quot;beloved baby&quot; of the United States - for their bases and oil resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1948, when the Jews returned to their homeland, they actually carved out a piece of land next to Jerusalem to rebuild Israel - could the exiled Jews alone have such power? In fact, it was the UK and the US that were behind it. Britain was in ruins after the war, and Israel&#39;s main supporter was the United States. This country has its admirable features. It &quot;made something out of nothing&quot; and quickly built the country into a decent one. The level of Hebrew University is no less than the top universities in China and no less than the top universities in the United States. Taiwan&#39;s military research institute often asks Israeli consultants to help solve missile problems and also asks them to help solve problems of building nuclear power plants. These people are top experts. I have been to Israel several times and the people are very disciplined, live a simple life and are hardworking. But over the past few decades, Israel&#39;s courage and mentality to try and learn when it built the communes have been lost. However, the United States must defend Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States has deeply intervened in Middle East politics and launched three wars: the Gulf War/Kuwait War, the Iraq War, and the Afghanistan War. Then right after that, came the Iran War. Only recently did the U.S. military retreat from Afghanistan in disgrace. At the end of each war, the ruins were left in ruins, and the place was devastated beyond recognition. More than thirty years of war by the United States have devastated the Middle East. Countries on the southern coast of the Mediterranean and the northern coast of Africa have not recovered their strength to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the consequences of the extension of the &quot;containment policy&quot; - the United States is addicted to expansion, and every president has a group of generals who want to expand. Blackwater International, which has close ties with those in power in the United States, specializes in the mercenary business. They have killed thousands of people and destroyed countries one after another. They are not responsible. The United Arab Emirates in the Middle East is also a product under the leadership of the United States: several small sheikhs in this area were united to establish the &quot;United Emirates&quot; - there are the most luxurious hotels in the world and the most luxurious cruise ships in the world are docked there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, post-war Japan was equivalent to a &quot;colony&quot; of the United States. During the Korean War, Japan provided logistical supplies and maintenance support to the United States, and also took the opportunity to completely update old equipment from World War II. In the 1970s, Japan&#39;s industry was at its peak and its productivity was the highest in the world. Japanese goods are everywhere in the world, including Toyota cars, Panasonic, Westfield Department Store, etc. Where Japanese businessmen are located, local housing prices can double or triple. The economy of East Asia has also grown along with Japan. The so-called &quot;flying geese theory&quot; - the coastal areas of mainland China has also played a part in this wave of economic prosperity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States cannot accept this situation: &quot;I supported you, and now you are riding on my head and taking away all my business.&quot; So it tightened money, increased tariffs, patent claims, etc. Using a combination of methods, Japan was driven underground within three years, and it has still not gotten up to this day. All famous Japanese brands, American companies have shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taiwan is smarter than Japan. It did not use American brands in construction back then. Companies like Taiwan Integrated Circuit Manufacturing Co., Ltd. applied for patent rights themselves - TSMC produced 80% of the world&#39;s chips. When Taiwan&#39;s economic model was originally designed, the lessons learned from Japan were taken into consideration. Taiwan&#39;s Evergreen Marine Corp. is one of the world&#39;s largest shipping companies. Greece&#39;s large fleet is now &quot;stuck&quot; by the United States, and Norway&#39;s large fleet cannot be blocked by the United States. Therefore, this &quot;leader&quot; does not talk about loyalty. The leading boss in China&#39;s arena is that the boss suffers and the younger brothers take advantage. The boss of the United States is: &quot;If you become my little brother, you have to listen to me and do whatever I want.&quot; How can such behavior not be disappointing? Recently, the United States has been raising tariffs on China and threatening the mainland with the Taiwan issue. From the East to the West, such behavior by the United States has caused complaints in the international circles led by it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Beauty wanes&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Over the past few decades, we have also seen the prosperity of the United States, which lasted for hundreds of years. When I arrived in the United States in 1957, I happened to read in the newspaper that an African-American primary school student was blocked from entering a white school. The country mobilized the state&#39;s self-defense forces to suppress the people&#39;s resistance with the power of the government. This dispute between &quot;black and white&quot; has never stopped. Because the black group is still stuck at the bottom of society, no matter how hard Martin Luther King, Jr. tried, it will not help - racial disputes have now become &quot;racial inertia&quot;, and disadvantaged races no longer fight for their rights. Instead, fight for government unemployment benefits. Judging from the numbers, the United States is short of 1.2 million workers, with only 250,000 unemployed people. Almost 1 million people are receiving government unemployment benefits and are unwilling to go out to work. If there are few people to live and many people to eat, the economy will go downhill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;American science and technology is developing rapidly. Today, digitization, automation, and artificial intelligence have reached such an extent that there are no lower-level workers in factories, only engineers and inspectors. In 1970, I came from Taiwan to teach at the University of Pittsburgh. There was a general strike, the White House was shaken, and the country didn&#39;t know what to do. If the same thing happened again today, would it shake the country in the same way? If a country has a quarter of the population, it is essentially supported by the national &quot;social welfare fund&quot;. When the government&#39;s tax revenue is not enough, it can only rely on money printing to solve the problem. The real power supporting the US dollar should be international trade and domestic income taxes - but in fact it is a mess. Many American companies have their income elsewhere and their excess money in international accounts. Today, the U.S. economy is shaky, and all economic laws such as currency issuance limits are not obeyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 1980 to 2008, two huge economic crises were caused by credit problems, corruption problems, false mortgages and other issues. Originally, these were problems that the capitalist system did not allow to occur, because a healthy capitalist market economy relies on credit commitments. Two economic crises nearly brought the U.S. economy to collapse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SnXMoQYx0RoIF2HMbbwDZ0Den6Mxw13zZapINkNc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;646&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SnXMoQYx0RoIF2HMbbwDZ0Den6Mxw13zZapINkNc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255339&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearest United States The economy, when it was supposed to be a period of great panic and recession, actually saw price rises and stock prices rise again - we all could see that there was something fake about it. This situation shows that the United States is deceiving itself. But there are so many disadvantaged groups in the country who rely on state subsidies to survive. What should we do if things continue like this? What should we do about these vulnerable groups who support the unreasonable and fierce right wing? The &quot;four freedoms&quot; advocated by Roosevelt were right, but now the &quot;fifth freedom&quot; has appeared: the freedom of &quot;don&#39;t mess with me&quot;. Whether you want to work, go to school, etc., everyone thinks it is a personal matter - such an &quot;independent spirit&quot; is not a healthy independent spirit. I hope that young people in China will not &quot;lie down&quot; - but the trend of the world seems to be developing like this, which is not worrying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten years ago, I wrote an article about reflection on American society, which later developed into a book: &quot;Sixty Years of Vicissitudes in the United States: A Chinese&#39;s Insights.&quot; At that time, I criticized the crisis that the United States was about to face: government bureaucracy, social disorganization, and extravagance and waste—especially waste on the military and national defense. However, the government has not fulfilled its responsibilities in what it should do: many of the country&#39;s hardware facilities, including bridges, airports, roads, and water pumps, are broken, but no one is taking care of them. In current American society, the most important issue is the national laxity: what the government is arguing about every day is whether abortion is legal, the rights of transgender people, etc. - This is not to say that these issues are not important, but that these topics occupy everyone&#39;s attention. The power has been reduced to a grandstanding project for politicians, and matters that are truly related to the national economy and people&#39;s livelihood are left unattended. This country is hollowing out its own spiritual culture and economic strength. This country is moving towards waste, laziness, consumption and hollowing out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After &quot;9·11&quot;, the United States used the slogan of revenge against terrorists to intervene in numerous disputes in the Middle East. In order to punish them, how much did the United States spend on foreign wars? How much of a bad reputation does it get? How much of the country&#39;s strength is spent on killing people? Spend it on hired guns? Spending money on drones? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most arrogant and extravagant Roman Empire in history, the most wasteful French King Louis XIV, and the most barbaric Russian Czar, their arrogance and waste are not as serious as those of the United States. If the big ship of the U.S. economy sinks, people like us living in the United States will drown along with it, and the world economy will also collapse. How to recover from such a crisis is a question that keeps people awake all night and unable to think of a way out. But it is indeed difficult to make up for such a failure in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been many books criticizing American capitalism, but American politicians are unwilling to listen to these critical voices, or are too late to listen - for them, the most important thing is how to capture votes and enter the country. Lord White House. When I started writing &quot;Sixty Years of Vicissitudes in America: A Chinese&#39;s Insights&quot;, there were at least twelve books and a large number of articles critical of the United States available - today I checked, and these self-critical books are gone. However, people of insight are still criticizing, and a few reporters and commentators in the New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, and Saturday Review constantly remind us that a crisis is coming. &quot;The fire is about to start,&quot; but no one noticed. This incident not only made me feel sad, but also sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I would also like to advise the “aestheticists” in China not to value only “beauty”. &quot;Beauty grows old&quot; will affect all parts of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have seen Americans working hard and seeing that the operation of American democracy is the accumulation of many people’s efforts. I have seen the United States’ assistance to poor countries and small countries, and even the support and support provided by churches to local believers in various places. Education is something I admire. Moreover, I once hoped that the American political system would continue to improve and be modified over time. Therefore, today we see that American society is disorganized, its politics is vulgar, and it is so arrogant and ignorant in international relations. You can imagine that American society has changed from a beautiful image in memory to a broken one in reality. Broken mirror, my mood is self-evident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广州地铁安检要求乘客试喝自带水，被索赔4.8万元，判了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259391]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 16:51:43&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Subway stations are public places, and the subway company, as the person in charge of management, has the obligation to ensure public safety. Is &quot;taking a sip&quot; of bottled water, a common security inspection method, suspected of infringement? Recently, the Guangzhou Railway Transport Intermediate Court disclosed the trial details of a related case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Passengers said they felt unwell after trying to drink their own water&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Taking Guangzhou Metro to court for compensation of 48,100 yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;On December 14, 2022, because Zhang entered the station with liquid, the security personnel asked Zhang to undergo a liquid test. Zhang drank the bottled water he brought, and then the security personnel released him into the subway. car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Zhang claimed that the bottled water he drank was self-bottled boiled water, and he himself suffered from gastrointestinal diseases, which caused him extreme discomfort after drinking water, and this incident also caused him severe mental illness. Because of the irritation and distress, the defendant filed a lawsuit with the court, claiming that the defendant Guangzhou Metro Company had infringed the law and requested compensation for medical expenses, lost work expenses, nutrition expenses, mental losses, etc., totaling 48,100 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;[Judge’s statement]&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;There is no fault in the security personnel’s request for “drink tasting”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Passengers should cooperate and support subway security inspection&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Guangzhou Railway Transport Court held that this case is a dispute over the rights to life, health and body. In this case, Zhang claimed that the violation of his physical and mental health was caused by the security inspection behavior of the defendant Guangzhou Metro Company, and corresponding evidence should be provided to prove it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the Guangzhou Metro Company sets up security checks at the entrance and requires passengers to pass liquid detectors or &quot;take a sip&quot; if they carry liquids. This is because it is an urban rail transit operating unit. Therefore, the security personnel required Zhang to test the liquid he carried, and there was no fault. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, Zhang failed to provide evidence to support his claims of medical expenses, lost work pay, nutrition expenses, mental loss expenses, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The examination report form, outpatient medical records and other evidence provided by Zhang also show that he had been diagnosed with gastrointestinal diseases as early as the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2022 and had multiple examinations and medical visits. He was diagnosed with a sleep disorder due to insomnia symptoms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Zhang cannot prove that the subway security inspection’s request for him to “take a sip” of his own water has a causal relationship with the damage he claims. Zhang claims that Guangzhou Metro Company has infringed upon him and should be liable for compensation. Please, lack of factual and legal basis, the court will not support it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The presiding judge of the Guangzhou Railway Transport Court stated that security inspection is a necessary means for the subway company to fulfill its safety obligations, and passengers should support and cooperate as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Civil Code clearly stipulates that operators and managers of subway stations, railway stations, airports and other places who fail to fulfill their safety obligations and cause damage to others shall bear tort liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Urban Rail Transit Operation Management Regulations&quot; promulgated by the Ministry of Transport also clearly stipulates that passengers are prohibited from carrying toxic, harmful, flammable, explosive, radioactive, corrosive and other hazards that may endanger personal and property safety. Items coming in and taking the bus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a vicious incident occurs on a means of transportation, the space is very limited and it is difficult to evacuate in time to reduce injuries. Therefore, security inspection, as the most effective preventive measure that public transportation managers can take, is reasonable and If necessary, passengers should understand and cooperate as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To claim infringement, it is necessary to prove the existence of a causal relationship between the infringement behavior and the damage results. A general tort must include an infringing act, a damaging result, a causal relationship between the infringing act and the damaging result, and the perpetrator&#39;s subjective fault. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, Zhang claimed that the security check behavior caused physical discomfort and mental stimulation. However, the existing evidence can only prove that he had suffered from illness and insomnia before, but could not prove that he was physically injured after the security check behavior. Or the disease worsened, so Zhang’s claim for infringement and compensation from the subway company has no factual and legal basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“老实人”成了贬义词：语义嬗变背后是对消费和情绪的无度索求]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259338]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It is generally believed that &quot;honest&quot; as an adjective has two levels of semantics in Chinese, one of which refers to morality. Honesty and reliability on one level, and secondly, law-abiding and orderly behavior on the other. Before the 1980s, &quot;honest&quot; was definitely a positive evaluation of a person. Whether in the workplace or in the marriage and mate selection market, the evaluation of &quot;honest people&quot; was similar to some kind of quality assurance and played an important role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that honesty, reliability and law-abiding are out-and-out excellent qualities in any society with normal moral tendencies. However, starting in the 1990s, the semantics of &quot;honest person&quot; changed rapidly, and gradually became associated with negative connotations such as &quot;poor interpersonal skills&quot;, &quot;cowardly&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;low economic ability&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the Internet age, &quot;honest people&quot; have been infinitely deconstructed, especially in the marriage and love market. &quot;Honest people&quot; are directly linked to &quot;low emotional intelligence&quot;, &quot;cannot provide emotional value&quot; and &quot;boring&quot;, and become With the out-and-out &quot;minus points&quot;, &quot;honest people&quot; have been completely marginalized in the marriage and love market. A 2017 study showed that &quot;honesty&quot; surpassed &quot;poor economic conditions&quot; and &quot;no formal job&quot; to become the second largest reason why young people over 35 years old in a certain place become &quot;singles&quot; (the first reason is illness or physical disability) ). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a live broadcast not long ago, an online anchor became furious because he was called an &quot;honest person&quot; by his fans. Perhaps he could not accurately grasp the changes in &quot;honest people&quot;. Complex semantics, but he instinctively felt insulted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the quality assurance of character to the infinitely deconstructed stigma in the Internet society, what have &quot;honest people&quot; experienced in the development and changes of modern society? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Honest people&quot; wandering in the midst of social changes&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the early days of reform, the semantic change of &quot;honest people&quot; from praise to derogation is actually not difficult to understand. In the rapidly changing social environment at that time, the market economy and industrial civilization were rapidly changing all aspects of society. The life experiences that &quot;honest people&quot; who tend to follow the rules and practice in the traditional social life model are quickly overturned. And because they fail to make adaptive changes and responses to social changes in a timely manner, they will naturally be at a relatively disadvantaged level and position economically within a period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, drastic social changes have created considerable &quot;grey areas&quot; in the economic field. In such chaos and prosperity, &quot;the bold will die of hunger and the timid will starve to death&quot; once became a popular survival creed in society. There are indeed a group of people who have made their first pot of gold in these fields. The cautious and lawful side of &quot;honest people&quot; determines that they are destined not to be one of these trend-setters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the above two points, the series of changes in the semantics of &quot;honest person&quot; at the end of the last century are actually a normal manifestation of the changes in individual value evaluation standards during social changes, and it is not difficult to understand. . After the social and economic order stabilized, the reputation and reputation of &quot;honest people&quot; took a positive turn. Especially during the period of rapid growth in the first decade of the 21st century, &quot;honest people&quot; were under construction and development. Showing a series of work characteristics gives honest people an aura of being &quot;down-to-earth, hard-working and willing to work&quot;, which improves the image of &quot;honest people&quot; to a considerable extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, the reasons for the infinite deconstruction and image decline of the meaning of &quot;honest person&quot; in the Internet society are much more complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Honest people&quot; who are excluded and marginalized by cultural capital&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From the end of the last century to the beginning of this century, first television and then the Internet had a major impact on social values. With the popularization of television and the Internet, the cultural center effect of modern society has begun to become prominent. A cultural paradigm based on the cultural center&#39;s lifestyle and values ​​has been created and introduced to the public through countless movies, television, entertainment and variety shows. spread throughout society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When countless young people living in the seventh and eighth tier cities, the urban-rural interface and the vast rural areas are immersed in the cultural products produced in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, they are actually unknowingly Accept the life patterns and values ​​advocated by these cultural products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, cultural capital uses a modern approach to reduce the vast majority of people to spectators, consciously or unconsciously watching a few people at the center interpret their lives. Most of the joys, sorrows, joys, sorrows and hatreds on the screen take place in the reinforced concrete forests of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. When &quot;small town youth&quot; and &quot;small town youth&quot; watch the screen as viewers, it means that they have subconsciously accepted the &quot;central paradigm culture&quot; expressed and conveyed by these cultural products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This cultural paradigm based on the super city has quite distinctive characteristics - the social environment of a highly developed commodity economy, the values ​​of consumerism and hedonism, and the concept of love and mate selection of the urban middle class. Way. The cultural center effect is so strong that when some film and television works try to change the subject matter or scene, they often fall into embarrassing situations. In a certain film and television work, the protagonist from a poor background wears a down jacket from a North American brand worth more than 10,000 yuan, using seven The fact that the 8,000-yuan iPhone is considered a joke is obviously the result of the screenwriter being trapped in this cultural paradigm and unable to extricate himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, cultural capital spares no effort to promote the central lifestyle and values; on the other hand, it marginalizes and excludes other lifestyles and values. The core of this cultural paradigm promoted by cultural capital is actually the basic feature of postmodern society, that is, the desire for consumption and the emotional demand anytime and anywhere. The former is the most ideal state of material satisfaction that an individual can achieve in a highly developed commodity economy society, while the latter is the basic requirement to combat individual loneliness in a highly atomized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, under this cultural paradigm, a typical successful social individual either has endless money or the ability to please others anytime, anywhere, preferably both. Of. The problem with &quot;honest people&quot; is that they often have neither such economic standards nor such character conditions. Therefore, it is natural for them to become an excluded and marginalized group of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In film and television works and entertainment and love variety shows, &quot;romantic, humorous, rich&quot; are the &quot;perfect characters&quot;, and the advantages of &quot;honest people&quot; are ignored or forgotten intentionally or unintentionally. On the contrary, &quot;honest people&quot; often become the ones who are ridiculed and ridiculed because they are &quot;dull&quot;, &quot;low in emotional intelligence&quot; and &quot;cannot provide emotional value&quot;.

There are one lost letter each to Mr. Zhang, and each of them is accompanied by a note of poems and a note of music. Following the elegant wishes of Teacher Zhang Yan, Hui Yu compiled and published it, writing a short essay and a brief explanation, for the benefit of others, and at the same time, it can be used to preserve the origins of a passage written by a senior scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Zhongpu (1912-1987), courtesy name Zhanyun and nickname Oubo, was born in Yugan, Jiangxi. He studied engineering at an early age and studied at Jiangxi Polytechnic College, determined to save the country through science. He then changed his studies to law and graduated from the Law Department of Peking University in 1937 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in law. He then specialized in literature, loved classical literature and was good at writing poetry. Dedicated to education throughout his life, he served as a Chinese language teacher at Nanchang Normal University, Linchuan Simple Normal University, and Yuqian Yuting Middle School. In 1934, he taught at the former National Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Normal University, and Hangzhou University, mainly taking charge of modern Chinese literature courses. He is the author of &quot;Guo Moruo&#39;s Historical Drama &quot;Qu Yuan&quot;&quot; (Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House, 1959), &quot;Analysis of &quot;The New Story&quot;&quot; (co-authored with Wang Rongchu, Zhejiang Literature and Art Publishing House, 1983), &quot;Yan Milou Poetry Manuscript&quot; ( Northern Literature and Art Publishing House, 2004), &quot;Notes on Xia Wanchun&#39;s &quot;Ode to the Great Sorrow&quot;&quot; (Threadbound Book Company, 2016), &quot;Modern Patriotic Poet Huang Zunxian&quot; (Tianhe Press, 2016), etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sixth volume of &quot;The Complete Works of Zhan Antai&quot; contains nine letters from Zhan to Long Yusheng, Chen Zhongfan, Yang Shuda, Luo Xianglin and Liu Baiduan. &quot;The Complete Works of Wang Jisi&quot; contains nearly 50 letters by Wang. At the end of his letter to Zhang Hanqing in October 1987, he wrote: &quot;I used to occasionally write some prose, but lately I have been immersed in ancient books and have rarely experienced new life experiences, except for relatives and friends. Outside of letters and letters, they rarely write.&quot; It can be imagined that Mr. Zhan Antai and Wang Jisi still have a lot of letters and letters lying around, waiting to be compiled. The two lost letters disclosed in this article can be regarded as a source of inspiration, or they can be regarded as A little bit of celery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/e6YB0i4iq3BTklJMlxLz0Qr0K9bOPi21KNDlq5Y4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;804&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/e6YB0i4iq3BTklJMlxLz0Qr0K9bOPi21KNDlq5Y4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255545&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhan Antai&#39;s letter and words to Zhang Zhongpu. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Letter from Zhan Antai to Zhang Zhongpu&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mr. Zhong Pu Written by: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Hui Shufeng It is reported that the great work is pure and healthy, and the workmanship is greatly admired. &quot;If you avoid the soldiers, you will face the water of Aotang.

According to the &quot;Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot;, Mr. Xia and Zhang Zhongpu went to Guangzhou to participate in a scientific research seminar at Sun Yat-sen University on January 5, 1957. On January 14, the two of them, accompanied by Zhan Antai and Wang Jinguang, visited Huanghuagang. The diary stated that they were &quot;majestic&quot; and &quot;taken a photo&quot;. This is the so-called &quot;Photography in Huanghuagang&quot; in the lost letter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the previously published lost letters and the relevant contents of &quot;The Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot;, it can be seen that after Zhang Zhongpu returned to Hangzhou from Guangzhou, he wrote to Zhan Antai and attached his own work. Check his &quot;Yan Mi Lou Poetry Manuscript&quot;, the sentence &quot;avoiding the soldiers and leaving the water in the Aotang, leaving the country is still the new willow shoots&quot; comes from Zhang&#39;s 1944 work &quot;The accumulated rain uses the Du Gongbu Hall to form a rhyme&quot;, the whole poem is: &quot;The accumulated rain and moss cover the grass, and the barbarian suburbs are temporarily stagnated by the smoke. The soldiers are left facing the water of the Aotang, and there are several new willow shoots in the country. The flying kites in the sky are startled by the meteorites, and the Peng in the clouds laughs at the nest. Zilan Ning It has the meaning of curing hunger, and the spirit of Yanjian Mountain is full of laughter.&quot; However, in the &quot;Poem Manuscript&quot; version, &quot;Yue Kun&quot; was changed to &quot;Ji Kun&quot;, which made the emotion even more intense. Zhan Antai said that &quot;it is pure and healthy, and it is extremely admirable for workmanship&quot; and &quot;it is still painful to recite it over and over again.&quot; Of course, he has the ancient etiquette of the older generation of scholars, but he also has a gaze like a torch, which illuminates the advantages of Zhang&#39;s poems. In his letters to Zhang Zhongpu in the 1960s, Miao Yue repeatedly said that &quot;great poems are fresh and elegant, and can integrate new ideas while maintaining the style and charm of old poems.&quot; , &quot;Great poetry can reflect reality, express new thoughts, and be admired after reading it.&quot; The two contrast each other, and the style and characteristics of Zhang&#39;s poetry can be seen better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Yuan Ri Occasionally Small Ci&quot; written in the poem &quot;Begging for Correction on a Separate Paper&quot; also survives in Teacher Zhang Yan&#39;s home. &quot;Yuan Day&quot; is January 31, 1957, the first day of the first month of the Dingyou year of the lunar calendar. &quot;The Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot; mistakenly refers to New Year&#39;s Day of the &quot;Renshen Year&quot; of Xia Zheng. The full text of the Ci is as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qi Tianle&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It would have been twenty years since I had talked with Qu Chan.

&lt;p>;《王季思全集》第六卷《韵文集》失收此曲。又该曲字迹与前述书函迥异，当出两手。王季思1986年所作《半间书室小沧桑》中说：“前爱人徐碧霞是我生活上美好的伴侣，除料理家务外，还帮助我接待宾客，誊清手稿。”就像陈寅恪先生晚年写信签字常由唐筼夫人代笔，王氏此曲也可能是徐夫人手抄。但同篇文章中他又写道：“好景不长。1957年以后，由于众所周知的事实，我在课堂里称道前代诗人交谊的&#39;友朋之欢&#39;，介绍前人爱情作品的&#39;闺房之乐&#39;，受到了批判。碧霞不久因病去世，家庭里丧失了欢趣。政治上的避嫌带来了朋友的疏远。这是半间书室的又一次小沧桑。”徐夫人1957年初查出罹患恶疾，1958年9月不幸去世。所以这篇散套的抄写者是徐夫人抑或其他家人、学生，尚存疑问。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“《文学史》稿从第二次大放大鸣后，即已搁笔，不知何日方能完稿”，王季思参与其事早在数年之前，夏先生则稍有涉及。据《夏承焘日记全编》1953年9月8日：“得季思中山大学信，谓暑假中去北京，在北大浦江清家遇何其芳，说北大文科研究所欲集中力量，在两三年内编成《中国文学史》初稿。季思已由中大派往工作一年，何君并欲调予往参加此工作。季思望予能去工作一二年。”1955年9月30日：“步奎交来季思所撰文学史宋元部分。阅论苏、梅、欧诸家各节，颇多新意。”1957年12月24日：“接文学研究所《中国文学史》编委会游国恩、何其芳、余冠英函，嘱写《词的兴起》一章，八千字。”1958年5月25日：“午后寄《词的兴起》与北京大学余冠英。此综合大学《文学史》教科书初稿，本定三月交稿，逾期两月矣。”这部由游国恩、王起（王季思原名）、萧涤非、季镇淮、费振刚五人署名主编的《中国文学史》于1963年由人民文学出版社出版，是多年来国内发行量最大、全国高校中文系流传最广的一部中国文学史教材。 &lt;/p>;

Although the public officials involved have been detained by the police and may be subject to disciplinary action thereafter, the reflection on this incident cannot stop there. The top priority is for local governments to strictly protect the interests of foreign agricultural investors in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 21, a video shot by a drone spread online. In the video, a man wearing a hat and plainclothes is cutting sorghum ears with scissors, while a uniformed man stands not far away and watches. After discovering that they had been photographed, the two walked towards a parked vehicle nearby. The man wearing a hat put the bucket containing sorghum ears into the trunk of a family SUV and walked towards a car in front of him with the word &quot;Patrol&quot; painted on it and equipped with police lights. car. The men in uniform got into the family SUV and started the vehicle. The poster of the video questioned that law enforcement officers from Sanhejian Town drove people to steal sorghum in patrol cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the video attracted attention, Sanhejian Town government propaganda staff said in an interview with the media on October 22 that the uniformed person in the video was indeed a public official of the town, but he did not participate in pinching sorghum. He was filmed while patrolling to &quot;stop&quot; people from picking sorghum, which caused a &quot;misunderstanding.&quot; The publicist also said that in order to eliminate everyone&#39;s doubts, the public security organs have intervened in the investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public security agency’s investigation results quickly slapped the propagandist in the face. A notice issued by the Sanhejian Town Government on the evening of the 22nd showed that after police investigation and verification, the uniformed person in the video was Yin Moumou, a staff member of the Sanhejian Town Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Brigade, and the other person was Zhang Moumou, a villager of Sanhuai Village. The two went to Gaoliang. The thieves cut sorghum ears on the ground; the two have been administratively detained by the police. Next, the Sanhejian Town Discipline Inspection Commission will seriously hold the party members and cadres involved accountable and deal with them in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public officials who are supposed to patrol to stop sorghum theft, drive patrol cars and lead people to cut sorghum and participate in the theft. It is really magical. What&#39;s even more magical is that after the incident was revealed, local officials immediately defended &quot;their own people&quot;, claiming that public officials were not involved in the theft, but to stop theft by the masses. If it hadn&#39;t been later verified by the police, many netizens might have truly believed this statement: Look, the person who stole the sorghum cuttings walked to the patrol car and was about to be taken back for questioning. The law enforcement officers drove away the car that stole the cuttings. There is absolutely nothing wrong with bringing back stolen goods, crime tools, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, they are not just facing netizens. Because the sorghum they stole was not ordinary sorghum. That is the local raw material production base of Moutai Group. As one of the most well-known brewing companies in China, Moutai Group has a high influence. In order to ensure the supply of brewing raw materials, Moutai Group has established raw material production bases in many places, and Gushi County in Henan is one of them. No matter where Moutai Group builds its raw material base, it will undoubtedly receive great attention from the local government. The Gushi County Government has set up a special Moutai organic raw material base construction office, which shows that the local government attaches great importance to this matter. Therefore, when the theft of sorghum cuttings attracted attention on the Internet, the local government would not dare to fool them. The public official literally hit the steel plate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, even for agricultural projects that the local government attaches great importance to, public officials dare to participate in theft, which shows that theft of crops is common in the local area. Some netizens said that many local farmers have a large amount of sorghum drying in front of their homes, but they do not grow sorghum themselves. So where does the sorghum come from? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant information released by Moutai Group, Moutai uses a specialized sorghum variety &quot;Hongyingzi&quot; for brewing. In Renhuai, Guizhou and other places, Moutai Group has purchased Hongyingzi sorghum at a protective price and will acquire it in 2022. The price is as high as 11.2 yuan/kg, much higher than the price of ordinary sorghum on the market. The sorghum grown at the Moutai raw material base in Gushi County is claimed to be organic sorghum, and its purchase price may be higher. Perhaps each thief may not steal too much, but if many people steal, it will cause huge losses to the growers. Perhaps this is why sorghum farming companies have to use drone patrols to detect and stop thieves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is a common problem faced by foreign agricultural investors. Just a few days ago, news broke out in Dancheng, Henan, that hundreds of farmers were robbing corn. News about people stealing peanuts, pumpkins, watermelons, and fish and shrimps emerged one after another across the country. These incidents all have one thing in common. Most of the people who steal things are local farmers, while those who are stolen are mostly people who transfer land for agricultural investment. Of course, there are also people who return to their hometowns to start agricultural businesses, and they are also stolen. After the incident, the local government often excused the local farmers by saying they were &quot;picking up&quot; crops that their owners had missed and discarded. But in fact, these so-called &quot;pickings&quot; often occur when growers are in the process of harvesting. The owner&#39;s harvesting machinery was still working, and the &quot;picker&quot; ran in front of the machine. Is there such a &quot;picker&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Allowing farmers to steal crops will not only harm the interests of investors, but may also cause serious injuries. Recently, there have been many incidents in which farmers were seriously injured or even killed by large harvesting machinery while &quot;picking up&quot; crops. Propaganda staff from Sanhejian Town in Gushi County also said in response to the media that patrols were organized considering that it might be unsafe for people to pick up sorghum during the sorghum harvest. As for the losses caused to growers by farmers stealing sorghum, the propagandist did not seem to care too much, &quot;Rural people just love to take advantage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is not a trivial matter that some farmers &quot;love to take advantage&quot;. The local government&#39;s &quot;harmony&quot; excuse for local farmers instead of safeguarding the interests of agricultural investors in accordance with the law undoubtedly embolden the thieves and makes agricultural investors feel disappointed. If things continue like this, who will dare to invest? Farmers who steal crops shall be subject to public security penalties and criminal penalties. Only in this way can this trend be stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, an urban management law enforcement team member from Sanhejian Town, Gushi County was arrested for stealing sorghum. He hit a large steel plate. The interests of small agricultural entrepreneurs should also be protected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[神舟十七号载人飞船发射取得圆满成功]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259342]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 11:46:35&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/26/451b72081ad4d31f5e60b2323543aa71.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;1104&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/26/451b72081ad4d31f5e60b2323543aa71.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255595&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the China Manned Space Engineering Office, the Shenzhou 17 manned spacecraft successfully separated from the rocket and entered the predetermined orbit.
