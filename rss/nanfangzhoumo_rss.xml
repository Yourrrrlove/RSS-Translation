Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Huan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhongjiang County in Sichuan Province was once the county with the largest number of people who have not been lifted out of poverty, apart from the national and provincial poverty-stricken counties in Sichuan. There is a scenic spot in the mountains here, spanning three counties and three towns, with a planned area of ​​15.3 square kilometers, equivalent to the size of 15 Forbidden City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is known as &quot;the only imperial cultural area in the world&quot; and includes nearly 2,000 statues, including nearly 500 portraits of emperors and generals, thousands of imitation &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot;, and more than 3 meters high. Images such as &quot;Seven Fairies&quot; and &quot;Eight Immortals&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it was not completed. No one cared about it for many years. The statue gradually peeled off and faded, disappearing in the grass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2021, someone asked on the official website of &quot;Ask Politics in Sichuan&quot;: &quot;The ancient Fengdian Town in Zhongjiang, Sichuan is famous all over the world. What is the reason why it has not been completed for many years?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fengdian Town is famous all over the world. The town government responded in November that the capital chain of the scenic spot builder was broken, with about 28 million yuan in arrears in project payments and more than 80 million yuan in arrears in financing, involving more than 2,700 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more surprising is that the judgment document website states that the legal representative of the developer was sentenced at the end of 2019 for illegally occupying agricultural land for the construction of a scenic spot. While he was on probation, he was still actively soliciting investment. In June 2022, the scenic spot announced its temporary closure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How was such a behemoth built? Who is responsible for its failure? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Terracotta Warriors and Horses from Sichuan&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; The ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Area is affiliated to Deyang City. According to promotional materials, the project was launched in 2014 with a total planned investment of approximately 3.1 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its location is relatively remote, more than an hour&#39;s drive from the center of Deyang and surrounding cities, such as Chengdu and Guanghan. Drive from the Fengdian section exit of Zhongjiang County on the Hurong Expressway and turn right. You will see 9 golden bull elephant sculptures, which are the main entrance of the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The tour loop is 19 kilometers long. Welcome to take the sightseeing bus.&quot; A line of golden characters at the main entrance reminds tourists of the scale of the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main entrance is built in imitation of ancient city walls, with couplets in red letters on a gold background hanging on both sides: North, south, east, west, there is no other place in the world, but this place has existed in the world throughout the ages. After the scenic spot was temporarily closed, the gates were locked and items in the ticket room were smashed. Nearby villagers gather under the &quot;golden elephant&quot; to chat, and occasionally give directions to curious tourists from out of town. &quot;You can climb over the wall.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beside the Jade Dragon Gate at the entrance of the scenic spot, the Fengdian Town Government posted a notice in March 2023, warning tourists not to enter the scenic spot in any way, because the current infrastructure is incomplete and there are major safety risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone opened a trail from the left side of Jade Dragon Gate. If you walk forward for a few minutes against the weeds more than 1 meter high, you will see a statue of an emperor more than 2 meters high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The statue of the emperor in the grass.

Photographed by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Huan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are making CALL online. Qin Emperor and Han Wu invite you to point out the country together.&quot; According to the scenic spot promotion, there are nearly 500 statues here, including Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, Wu Zetian, Taizu of the Song Dynasty, etc. The emperors of modernization also include the leaders of the &quot;Five Hus and Sixteen Kingdoms&quot; and the &quot;Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hong Hai participated in the construction of about 100 emperor statues from the Tang Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty and stayed in the scenic spot for more than two months. He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters on the phone that the developer was inspired by &quot;Pictures of Emperors of the Past&quot; by Yan Liben, a painter from the Tang Dynasty, and wanted to present the emperors of the past dynasties in the form of sculptures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statue is placed in a cement field called &quot;Chinese Historical Process Park&quot;. The scenic spot hopes to allow tourists to appreciate five thousand years of Chinese culture by displaying the emperor&#39;s style and introducing his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if tourists look carefully, they will laugh. For example, Emperor Gong of the Sui Dynasty Yang You (605-619) only lived 15 years old, but the statue of Yang You in the scenic area has a thick long beard and wrinkles on his face, making him look like a mature uncle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The text introduction is not rigorous enough. For example, in the introduction to Song Taizu, &quot;Zhao Kuangyin practiced martial arts when he was young, and first joined Guo Wei, Taizu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty. Later, he followed Chai Rong, Emperor Shizong of the Zhou Dynasty, to fight in various places, and made many military exploits. There were commanders and envoys in front of the palace, and he mastered ice boxing.&quot; Not only is the sentence incomplete, it also contains typos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Hong Hai said that he and his team were not involved in the coloring and text introduction of the statue. The appearance of the emperor was also built based on the drawings provided by the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that the raw materials of these imperial statues are mainly steel bars and cement, which are cheaper than copper. He did not disclose the total price, citing commercial confidentiality. Due to lack of maintenance and management, hundreds of emperors are now living with dead grass. Under the sun and rain, the acrylic paint on many statues has faded, exposing gray cement, and steel bars are also exposed at the joints of the bases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not far from the emperor&#39;s statue, nearly a thousand &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; are quietly guarding in the mud. These &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; imitate armored warrior warriors, wearing battle uniforms, armor, and hair tied in high buns. However, compared with the various terracotta warriors and horses in the Qin Shihuang Mausoleum in Xi&#39;an, the &quot;Terracotta Warriors and Horses Sichuan&quot; are rough in workmanship, lack details in their expressions and costumes, and are weak in momentum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenic spot once attracted tourists with the gimmick that &quot;you can see the Terracotta Warriors and Horses without leaving Sichuan&quot;. Now these replicas are surrounded by moss and wild grass on the edge of the mountain forest, and some have white thatch inserted into their hands. &quot;Qin Shihuang&quot;, who was wearing a dragon robe, had a red ribbon &quot;praying for peace&quot; wrapped around his bun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a sign under the feet of &quot;Qin Shihuang&quot; that reads: &quot;No destruction of property!&quot; However, due to no one taking care of them, these imitations have faded and have cracks in many places. Some &quot;Kneeling Shooting Figurines&quot; were cut off at the waist, and many &quot;Warrior Figurines&quot; lost their arms and even their heads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early November 2023, Southern Weekend reporters also saw giant sculptures placed in scenic spots such as Seven Fairies, Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, Mother Earth, Chang&#39;e Flying to the Moon, Queens of the Four Seasons, and Zhuzi Square. They are three to four meters high, but the workmanship is rough when seen up close. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the publicity, there are more than 20 scenic spots in the scenic area, such as the Drunken Concubine, the Sifang Wealth Saint, the Yue Laotai, the Nine Fox Fairy Cave, and the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl. &quot;Their huge lineup and magnificent momentum are truly unmatched throughout the ages. Unparalleled.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While making emperor statues for Gu Ming Tian Xia, Hong Hai saw the terracotta warriors and horses and other statues being moved into the scenic spot. He has been engaged in the sculpture industry for nearly 20 years and lamented, &quot;I have never seen anything that requires so many sculptures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the publicity of the scenic spot, the ancient name of the world is based on the five thousand years of Chinese civilization as the core theme, integrating the Chinese cultural story line into the natural ecology and cultural landscape, allowing the story to connect, empower and cast the soul of the landscape. Thus forming an internal logical connection. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Driving local people to get rich&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Developers came to this town in 2014. According to (2019) Sichuan 0623 Xingchu No. 409 Judgment, on March 7, 2014, Sichuan Gumingtianxia Investment Management Co., Ltd. signed an investment cooperation framework agreement with the Fengdian Town Government of Zhongjiang County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhongjiang County is a major agricultural county in the hilly areas of Sichuan. The food crops grown are mainly rice, rapeseed and wheat. Fengdian Town under its jurisdiction is also a typical remote agricultural town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The agreement stipulates that Gumingtianxia Investment Company will invest 370 million yuan to build a new wintersweet viewing base and agricultural tourism project in Fengdian Town. The Fengdian Town Government agrees to provide its company with the land for this project within the ownership and land scope of Huangping Village and Hejia Village Committees. The area shall be based on the lease area signed between the company and the village, but it shall not change the land without authorization. Nature of land use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the investment cooperation framework agreement obtained by Southern Weekend reporters, the two parties also agreed that Gumingtianxia Investment Company should register and establish a Zhongjiang branch within the jurisdiction of Zhongjiang County. After the project is completed and put into operation, taxes will be paid in the territory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 21, 2014, Zhou Lizhu registered and established Sichuan Guming Tianxia Tourism Development Co., Ltd. in the name of her daughter Zhou Xiaxia (in 2016, the legal representative became Zhou Lizhu, hereinafter referred to as &quot; &quot;Anciently Famous&quot;), with a registered capital of 100 million yuan, and Zhou Lizhu holds 100% of the shares. The registered address of Gu Ming Tian Xia is No. 5, Huangping Village, Fengdian Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main entrance of the scenic spot is built in Huangping Village. Southern Weekend reporters learned from many Huangping Village villagers that rents in scenic spots range from 400 yuan/mu/year to 1,000 yuan/mu/year. One villager said that the land on the mountain was basically unable to grow food and was originally abandoned with no income. The scenic spot also hired local people to do cleaning, maintenance and other work, providing some jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenic spot also mentioned in its publicity that it will &quot;drive local people to become rich.&quot; The economy of Zhongjiang County is relatively backward. Information disclosed by the Sichuan Provincial Poverty Alleviation and Immigration Bureau shows that there were 92,500 poor people in Zhongjiang County in 2014. From 2011 to 2014, the province allocated 65.642 million yuan in special financial poverty alleviation funds for Zhongjiang County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investment cooperation framework agreement stipulates that Gumingtianxia plans to invest 370 million yuan, and the project construction period will be 4 years and will be completed at the end of December 2018. After completion, it can achieve annual sales revenue of 200 million yuan and tax revenue of 20 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Lizhu is from Dazhou, Sichuan Province. Local media in Dazhou reported his story twice. In 1980, Zhou Lizhu worked as a cashier in a mining company in Dazhou, earning more than 60 yuan a month. But he felt &quot;so tired&quot; that he resigned after five months and set up a leather factory. Zhou Lizhu was only 17 years old at the time and was called the &quot;Doll Factory Manager&quot; by her 10 workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Mr. Zhou Lizhu, who has been in business for a long time, has a heroic spirit between his brows, and his beard makes his outline more subtle and elegant.&quot; According to the scenic spot promotion article, Zhou Lizhu has since He has worked in communication equipment, steel manufacturing, real estate, tourism and other industries, and has also studied in the EMBA class of Xiamen University and Peking University Guanghua School of Management. However, according to the verdict, Zhou Lizhu only had a junior high school education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to &quot;well-known entrepreneur&quot;, another label attached to Zhou Lizhu is &quot;philanthropist&quot;. According to the &quot;Dazhou Evening News&quot; report, Zhou Lizhu once used part of Gumingtianxia&#39;s operating income to establish the &quot;Love Weekly Special Fund&quot;. In October 2015, he donated 200 cherry blossom saplings worth 100,000 yuan to his hometown of Dazhu County, Dazhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It took four years of construction before it was found to be illegal&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the Zhongjiang County Government website, in August 2016, the first phase of the Gumingtianxia project was registered, and the scenic area is planned to cover an area of ​​about 3,000 acres. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an investor, Southern Weekend reporters obtained the registration notice for the scenic spot’s corporate investment project from Gumingtianxia’s investment recruiters. The project name is “Gumingtianxia Sightseeing and Tourism Project—Planting Base and Historical, Cultural and Leisure Plaza” Construction Project&quot;, with a total planned investment of 180 million yuan, and the source of funds will be self-raised funds. The planned land area is 2,400 acres, and the construction area of ​​the main buildings is 10,000 square meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The construction content includes a planting base, office building, visitor center, exhibition hall, cultural and leisure square and ancillary facilities. The scale of products and services is to plant 100,000 balengang crabapples and wintersweet plants each year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The registration notice shall be stamped by the Zhongjiang County Development and Reform Bureau. According to the remarks, the project unit can handle environmental protection, urban planning, land use, construction permit and other procedures in accordance with the law based on the notice. Construction of projects with incomplete relevant procedures shall not begin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice is valid for one year. During the validity period, if there are important changes (including changes in the project investment entity, construction location, main construction content, product technical solutions, and the expected change in the total investment or construction scale of the project by more than 20%, etc.), the project unit should apply for re- Filing. In October 2016, Gumingtianxia applied for re-registration, and the original planned land use of 2,400 acres was changed to 3,590.5 acres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another document obtained by Southern Weekend reporters showed that in August 2016, the Zhongjiang County Tourism Bureau sent a letter to Gu Ming Tian Xia, &quot;In principle, we agree that your company will invest in the development of Gu Ming Tian Xia Tourism in Fengdian Town.&quot; Tourism &#39;Project&#39;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the fourth year of signing the contract, the scenic spot was found to have illegally occupied agricultural land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned judgment stated that, “In addition to planting wintersweet, crabapple and other agricultural planting projects on the rented land, the company also carried out agricultural projects from 2014 to 2018 without obtaining any construction land approval documents and procedures. During the year, the use nature of the original leased land was changed and construction projects were started.&amp;nbsp;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, through the appraisal led by the former Deyang City Land and Resources Bureau and Zhongjiang County Forest Public Security Bureau, the scenic spot involved the occupation of damaged cultivated land. The area is 140.1595 acres, involving an occupied forest area of ​​18,360 square meters (approximately 27.54 acres). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two parts of the area actually account for a very small proportion in the scenic spot, accounting for approximately 4.67% of the registered planned land area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2019, the Zhongjiang County People’s Court sentenced Gu Mingtianxia to the crime of illegal occupation of agricultural land and was fined 50,000 yuan; Zhou Lizhu was sentenced to two years and six months in prison, suspended for three years, and fined Ten thousand yuan in gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past four years involving illegal construction, the scenic spot has still received support from the local government many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the public account of the scenic spot, in February 2016, the then Secretary of the Zhongjiang County Party Committee brought an inspection team to the scenic spot for guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of Zhongjiang County Government, on August 9, 2016, the former deputy county magistrate presided over the Gumingtianxia project construction promotion meeting and listened to the project planning unit’s status report, the project investor’s construction plan report and related Opinions and suggestions from department heads. The meeting requested that relevant departments should work together to coordinate and solve problems existing in project construction to ensure the smooth progress of the construction project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xing, one of the original managers of the scenic spot, told Southern Weekend reporters that the scenic spot did not clearly occupy basic farmland at the beginning of its construction. &quot;If he (the government) does not agree, does he dare to touch the land?&quot; Liao Xing said. Since 2014, she has followed Zhou Lizhu to work in Gumingtianxia, ​​mainly responsible for project management. After being owed wages, she resigned in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2017, the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Strengthening the Protection of Cultivated Land and Improving the Balance of Acquisition and Compensation&quot; to implement the strictest cultivated land protection system. According to the official website of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Land and Resources in September 2018, the Deyang Municipal Land and Resources Bureau paid close attention to the protection of cultivated land. In that year, the city carried out 685 dynamic inspections, discovered and stopped 10 land violations, and filed 4 cases for investigation and punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xing and the above-mentioned investment personnel said that after Gu Mingtianxia and Zhou Lizhu were sentenced and paid fines, the local government had adjusted the basic farmland and forestland occupied by the scenic spot into general land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the publicity materials of the scenic spot, on April 10, 2020, members of the Standing Committee of the Zhongjiang County Party Committee, Minister of Propaganda, Director of the County Culture and Tourism Bureau, and Deputy Director of the County Natural Resources Bureau visited the ancient Mingtianxia Scenic Spot to guide the work and provide opinions. Or suggest that Zhou Lizhu and others accompany him. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Twenty million is owed to build the scenic spot&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2015, the construction team began to enter the site. However, the construction of the scenic spot was carried out illegally at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A judgment shows that in August 2015, Chongqing Jingwu Industrial (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a contract with Gumingtianxia, ​​agreeing to undertake the construction of anti-corrosion cabin projects for office buildings, hotels, and commercial streets in scenic spots. However, because Gu Ming Tianxia did not obtain the approval procedures for the construction of the office building, the competent authorities prohibited the construction, and Chongqing Jingwu Industrial immediately stopped the construction of the office building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, the two parties signed a contract, agreeing to outsource the road pavement projects in the scenic area to Chongqing Jingwu Industrial. After June 2019, Chongqing Jingwu Industrial completed the roadbed construction, but because Gumingtianxia did not provide construction drawings and did not connect electricity for construction, it was unable to continue to complete the road pavement construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Rong was once one of the management members of the scenic spot. He told Southern Weekend reporters that because the scenic spot is a tourism project for investment promotion by the local government, the policy may be more liberal and construction will start first. He wants to build it first and then build it later. formalities. At present, Wang Rong is still owed about 100,000 yuan in salary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wang Rong admitted that the scenic spot violated the relevant regulations on temporary land use at the beginning of its construction. &quot;There is no planning or construction report.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Gumingtianxia is facing a shortage of funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above-mentioned judgment, in October 2016, Guming Tianxia issued an IOU to Chongqing Jingwu Industrial and admitted that it owed 2.6158 million yuan in project payment and 100,000 yuan in deposit. After returning the deposit, Gu Mingtianxia has been in arrears with the project payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from many construction parties that they had agreed with Gumingtianxia to &quot;advance funds first and then settle the settlement.&quot; Li Chengwu, a native of Sichuan, is in his fifties and has been in this business for more than 30 years, mainly contracting earthwork construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He saw that Zhou Lizhu had two companies under his name and thought he was quite strong. By the end of 2016, Li Chengwu calculated the accounts and found that the advance amount had reached nearly 5 million yuan. At this time, Zhou Lizhu still couldn&#39;t get the money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the Chinese New Year approached, Jiang Tao, who was in charge of the infrastructure project, and Yang Tinghong, who was doing the green sandstone paving project, also went to Zhou Lizhu to settle the bill, but they couldn&#39;t get their money back either. Zhou Lizhu&#39;s arrears to them were 2.9 million and 270,000 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Li Chengwu and others began to report the situation to the government. On September 1, 2017, at the Zhongjiang County Labor and Social Security Bureau, Gu Mingtianxia promised that Li Chengwu would pay off the project payment before August 30, 2018. After Zhou Lizhu signed, she wrote the word &quot;agree&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Li Chengwu and others belong to the &quot;Ancient Debt Collection Group&quot; with 88 people, including construction teams for landscaping, door and window guardrails, hardened roads, and paving bluestone in scenic spots. In November 2023, a boss who made doors and windows for scenic spots compiled statistics in the group. At least 22 construction teams were owed a total of about 20 million yuan in project payments, wages and deposits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many construction team bosses told Southern Weekend reporters that the reason why construction teams continued to enter the site in 2017 was because Gu Ming Tian Xia’s quotations were 5% to 10% higher than the market price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Judgment Documents Network, since the second half of 2017, construction parties have successively sued Zhou Lizhu and Gu Mingtianxia, ​​and won the lawsuit. Several plaintiffs applied for compulsory execution, but the court was unable to find any property or property clues in the name of the person subject to execution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the construction company, but also the villagers of Huangping Village, Fengdian Town, have been unable to get the rent from the scenic spot since about 2017. The investment promotion personnel of the above-mentioned scenic spots said that about 90% of the scenic spots are built in Fengdian Town, and so far the land rent arrears is about 9 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;This scenic spot spans three counties and three towns, with an area comparable to 15 Forbidden City.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Huan&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why is the ancient world always short of money? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the verdict, Gu Ming Tianxia initially planned to invest 370 million yuan in Fengdian Town. However, according to the publicity of the scenic spot, the total planned investment is about 3.1 billion yuan, and the scenic spot will be constructed in four phases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“He did many things, including running a leather factory, selling steel products, selling communications, and also did crowdfunding.” Qiu Song, a Dazhou native and a fellow villager of Zhou Lizhu, recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that Zhou Lizhu Lizhu &quot;crowdfunded&quot; a sum of money to start a company in Dazhou, and then went to Fengdian to build a scenic spot. Qiu Song built the steel frame structure for the scenic spot and is now owed about 1 million yuan by Gumingtianxia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Dazhou native took Zhou Lizhu to court in 2018. According to the judgment, since December 2013, Zhou Lizhu borrowed a total of 1.2 million yuan from the plaintiff&#39;s father and used three houses in Tongchuan District, Dazhou City to pay off the debt. However, the plaintiff discovered that the owner of the mortgaged property was not Zhou Lizhu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Chengwu also heard from Zhou Lizhu that he had a real estate development project in Dazhou. In order to collect debts, Li Chengwu went to the prefecture several times to look for Zhou Lizhu&#39;s property. &quot;Later I found out that he was deceived. He had no projects in Dazhou to draw money from.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Chengwu also went to Hainan because Zhou Lizhu claimed that there were 16 suites in a certain real estate in Sanya, which he could get. Several sets of money were paid to him. After he went there, he found that the person guarding the property was fellow Zhou Lizhu, and the property had nothing to do with Zhou Lizhu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Rong said that Zhou Lizhu once set up a financing company in Dazhou, financing money with 3 cents of interest and lending it to others at 5 cents or 8 cents. But later there were bad debts that could not be recovered, and he squandered some of them, resulting in arrears of hundreds of millions of yuan to investors. So Zhou Lizhu thought of setting up a scenic spot and claimed that all the financing funds had been invested in the construction of the scenic spot. &quot;Write a promise to those who owe money. The scenic spot will give you shares, and after the park opens, it will pay you dividends every year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Tear down the east wall to pay for the west wall, and the capital hole is getting bigger and bigger.&quot; Nanfang. Over the weekend, reporters learned from an official in Fengdian Town as an investor that Zhou Lizhu initially brought about 40 million yuan to build the scenic spot. After the money ran out, she went to Mianyang, Deyang, Suining, Chengdu, Nanchong and other places to raise funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianyancha shows that from 2017 to 2018, Zhou Lizhu registered companies related to Guming Tianxia in Deyang, Chengdu, Mianyang, and Suining. According to the Fengdian Town Government, Gu Ming Tianxia’s arrears in financing amounted to more than 80 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xing said that he did not know the source of Zhou Lizhu’s funds. He mentioned that due to road construction, the scenic spot received a road subsidy of about 1 million yuan from the local government, but other than that, it did not enjoy other subsidies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiang Tao, who is in charge of infrastructure projects, said that he saw two tourist buses parked in the scenic spot in 2017, and they were investors attracted by Gumingtianxia. &quot;Cheating the elderly out of their money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the judgment documents website, there are three judgments on private lending disputes related to Gu Ming Tianxia. The three judgments show that in March, May, and June 2019, Gu Mingtianxia borrowed 100,000, 10,000, and 100,000 from three people respectively, all promising an annual interest rate of 24%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, the three plaintiffs are all older, and were 71, 60, and 63 years old respectively when they borrowed the money. Two of them are from Mianyang and one is from Deyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the Blog China website, an investor who visited the scenic spot in October 2018 recorded the visit. At that time, the construction of the scenic spot was initially completed. The promoter said that the scenic spot was built solely by Zhou Lizhu. The original funds were sufficient. However, due to the continuous increase in raw material and labor prices in recent years, there was a gap in funds, so private funds were borrowed for the construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investor saw a retired man in his seventies investing 30,000 yuan at the scene. The old man had been defrauded of 210,000 yuan for buying &quot;health products.&quot; Seeing that the old man believed in Zhou Lizhu so much, the investor &quot;invested a little more.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 13, 2019, Guming Tianxia also announced that it would be listed on the Tianfu (Sichuan) United Equity Trading Center with the code 610161. Tianfu Equity Exchange Center is a regional equity market operating institution that provides financing channels for small, medium and micro enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above three judgments, as of January 2020, Gumingtianxia failed to pay interest to the three plaintiffs as agreed, nor could it repay the principal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where did Zhou Lizhu spend her money? Liao Xing said that all the money was invested in the project. Not all of the project money was paid, but part of it was paid. For example, he said that excluding transportation and installation fees, the production cost of each emperor statue is about 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wang Rong said that before 2017, Gumingtianxia’s investment in the scenic spot did not exceed 5 million yuan. &quot;The government did not require capital verification at that time, and in the end he could not get out a penny.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Chengwu heard from Zhou Lizhu that the scenic spot was originally planned to open in May 2017. But it was not officially opened to the public until the end of 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xing said that the company’s capital chain was broken because the scenic spot was affected by the epidemic and stopped operating just after it opened, leaving no income. &quot;Roads were built, trees were planted, the projects were all placed there and they were not taken away.&quot; He felt that Zhou Lizhu was &quot;a person who wants to do things.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Rong believed that Zhou Lizhu was using the scenic spot as a guise to make money outside and was not serious about developing the scenic spot. &quot;There is nothing inside except statues, and tourists will not come here a second time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xing also had doubts about the development of the scenic spot. “The plan is indeed too big.” He once received other companies that came to visit the scenic spot, and they told him that in order to complete the planning of the scenic spot, at least another 1 billion yuan must be invested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the &quot;Terracotta Warriors and Horses&quot;, Gumingtianxia originally planned to build a Zen medicine health and wellness ecological park, a low-altitude sports base, a Chinese history and culture study and travel base, a grand theater, an ancient Shaolin Temple and other attractions. Liao Xing said that the purpose of building a large scenic spot is to retain tourists staying overnight. Only when tourists stay there can the income be high. However, until the scenic spot closed, Gumingtianxia had not yet built a hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the scenic spot is not very attractive to tourists. In the East Square, Southern Weekend reporters saw several discarded tickets, priced at 98 yuan. There are 20 reviews of the scenic spot on Dianping. Most of them complain about the high fees, &quot;a bunch of fake sculptures in barren mountains and mountains&quot; and &quot;a waste of time and money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;There are thousands of imitation terracotta warriors and horses here.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Huan&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;While on probation, he is still running around&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;During the three years of probation, Zhou Lizhu is still soliciting investment. The Fengdian Town Government stated in November 2021 that it was actively urging Gumingtianxia investors to raise funds and finance from various sources to resolve the debt problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the scenic spot’s promotion, in December 2020, Zhou Lizhu signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Chengdu Tourism Association Travel Agency Branch on behalf of the scenic spot at the 2020 China (Sichuan) Tourist Attractions and Cultural and Creative Industry Innovation and Development Expo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I must do everything possible to repay your funds as soon as possible.&quot; At the beginning of 2022, Zhou Lizhu wrote a letter to investment members. The letter mentioned that in response to the issue of &quot;expiration of investment member contracts&quot;, under the guidance of the Zhongjiang County Party Committee, County People&#39;s Government and relevant superior departments, the company is vigorously promoting investment promotion and adopting a combination of project implantation cooperation + equity cooperation. Mode increases hematopoietic function. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2022, the scenic spot announced its temporary closure. In July, Li Chengwu went to the office to find Zhou Lizhu and saw him talking to two or three investors in the reception room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The office of Gumingtianxia is located in the courtyard-style &quot;Guming Courtyard&quot;. When Southern Weekend reporters visited the &quot;Ancient Courtyard&quot; in early November 2023, the office was already empty. The yellowed and wrinkled leaflets of the scenic spot were blown to the corners along with the fallen leaves by the wind and rain. There were sheep dung and insect corpses everywhere on the ground. It looked like the yard had been abandoned for a while. The reception room, financial room and other office areas were in a mess. Overturned office cabinets, broken glass and scattered papers showed signs of fierce conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the foot of &quot;Queen of Four Seasons&quot; is another office location that is famous all over the world. Nowadays, there are renderings of the scenic spot and a calligraphy painting of &quot;Swallowing Mountains and Rivers&quot; hanging indoors. Dust, sheep dung, and corpses of insects and ants are everywhere. There was probably a conflict here. The jewelry cabinet that originally contained sterling silver bracelets and natural Gobi red agate was broken, and the empty jewelry box and price tag fell to the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Zhongjiang County Government website, on the morning of July 23, 2022, members of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee, Minister of Propaganda, and Chairman of the County Federation of Trade Unions went to Fengdian Town to hold an on-site coordination meeting for the &quot;Ancient Famous World&quot; petition stabilization work. The County Public Security Bureau Bureau, County Culture and Tourism Bureau, County Natural Resources Bureau, County Economic and Foreign Affairs Bureau and other departments jointly participated in the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September of the same year, news about Zhou Lizhu appeared for the last time on the public account of the scenic spot. In his Mid-Autumn Festival message, he continued to convey to the outside world the company&#39;s determination to move forward, saying that it would &quot;fight the tough battle of attracting investment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official account of the scenic spot left an investment phone number. The contact person told Southern Weekend reporters that he was mainly responsible for updating the official account of the scenic spot and marketing. He had helped receive interested investors, but he had not met &quot;sincere investors&quot;. big investors”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The investment in tourist attractions is large and the return cycle is very slow. If the natural endowment is average, it is difficult to find investors. Other scenic spots have also gone bankrupt. They have no hematopoietic function and the profit model is unclear. Sooner or later, they will go bankrupt. Things.&quot; The contact claimed to have resigned at the end of 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from multiple creditors that Zhou Lizhu was admitted to the hospital at the end of 2022. Zhou Lizhu was 56 years old at the time. But Wang Rong believed that Zhou Lizhu had faked the news to avoid debts. On November 11, 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter called Zhou Lizhu’s mobile phone number, and the other party denied that she was Zhou Lizhu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above-mentioned scenic spot investment personnel and Fengdian Town officials, the scenic spot has not yet found a buyer. In early November 2023, the area near the &quot;Chang&#39;e Flying to the Moon&quot; statue at the entrance of the scenic spot and on both sides of the main entrance have been re-cultivated, and villagers have planted rows of rapeseed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ At the request of the interviewees, Hong Hai, Wang Rong and Liao Xing are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 11:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从喝无糖茶到内卷茶叶，年轻人又爱杯泡茶了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261035]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/21/604305f84ececbd8da5f7176dc8f4c18.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;736&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/21/604305f84ececbd8da5f7176dc8f4c18.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259011&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（Visual China&amp;nbsp; / Picture )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, more and more young people have begun to drink tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that drinking tea here does not refer to milk tea or tea drinks, but to making tea yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, young people began to show off the tea or Kung Fu tea they brewed in a cup, and a cup of black tea or green tea became a standard addition to their desks. Whether you are studying for postgraduate entrance exams, working as a migrant worker, or working overtime, drinking tea has gradually become a fashion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Sugar-free tea is once again popular&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, before making tea in cups, Suntory, Oriental Leaf, etc. Sugar-free tea has begun to be favored by young people. This kind of tea drink made from original tea leaves is different from other milk teas. It focuses on sugar-free and tea flavor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Whether it is the well-established Suntory or Oriental Leaf under Nongfu Spring, when recommending its own products, they emphasize the use of natural tea as raw materials, the fermentation process used, and the absence of additives. No sweeteners or additives, etc., and strive to have the purest original tea as its characteristic. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For young people who are under pressure from work and family, if they pay attention to their own sub-health and start to maintain health, they will inevitably start&lt;/span>; to consider nutritional content. intake, as well as a lifestyle of reducing and quitting sugar. This change in consumer mentality is the main mechanism that brings huge room for growth to sugar-free tea drinks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant data shows that from 2017 to 2022, the average annual compound growth rate of the market size of sugar-free tea reached 28%. It is expected to maintain a growth of around 10.9% from 2022 to 2027. ——Obviously, this wave of young people are starting to adapt to its taste and starting to buy it repeatedly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, for this kind of tea packaged in plastic bottles, of course, there are still shortcomings such as not being fresh enough, and the main way of drinking is cold drink. Especially cold drinks are actually not friendly to some girls who don’t like freezing. Even if it is heated in a convenience store, it will taste ordinary and may even affect the taste. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/f64539bbdceb90d4ec2b592dc48cdd6b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;764&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/f64539bbdceb90d4ec2b592dc48cdd6b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259009 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（Visual China&amp;nbsp;/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Cup bubble tea has become popular&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Nowadays, young people are choosing between sugary milk tea and frozen sugar-free tea. During the contact, more and more young people began to have &quot;new needs&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;2022 High-Quality Development Report of New Tea Drinks&quot; released by the Tea Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences&lt;/span>; and other institutions shows that 46.90% of the &quot;post-90s&quot; He said that he got to know more traditional teas in the process of consuming new tea drinks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Douyin data, in 2023, the proportion of interested users in the tea industry aged 18 to 30 will increase to 38.4%. This shows that the age group of tea drinking awareness is moving downwards, young people&#39;s tea drinking awareness is constantly improving, and the tea audience continues to show a younger trend. CCTV Finance&#39;s &quot;Zhengdian Finance&quot; column recently reported a market observation on the theme &quot;Young people are becoming more and more fond of drinking tea, becoming a new driving force for tea consumption&quot;, which also attracted attention and heated discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with sugar-free tea, making your own tea actually has many benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, you can choose the fresh &lt;span>; tea you like. Whether it&#39;s Mingqian Longjing with the aroma of beans, Wuyi Rock Tea with a mellow and sweet aroma, or Oolong or Pu&#39;er that removes oil and greasiness, different tea leaves bring different tastes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fresh tea leaves can immediately produce a fresh taste, and the taste is actually more mellow. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Furthermore, making your own tea is very friendly for ladies who like hot drinks. They no longer have to worry about cold tea being harmful to the stomach. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Moreover, you can buy several different teas and drink them according to the season or mood, and you can always adapt to your taste needs. Making freshly brewed tea requires a little time to boil water, throw tea leaves and wait for the juice to come out. It can make people feel calm and comfortable in the simple craftsmanship, and it is also a buffer against the pressure of study or work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In terms of tea selection, compared to sugar-free tea drinks, the selection of fresh raw tea leaves is rich and colorful. If you like black tea, there are Yunnan Dianhong, Fujian Jinjunmei, Yinjunmei, Anhui Qimen black tea and other black teas in China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For those who like green tea, West Lake Longjing, Dongting Biluochun, Huangshan Maofeng, Xinyang Maojian and Anhui&#39;s Lu&#39;an Guapian, etc., there are rich varieties of green tea, some of which are light and sweet in taste , some are fragrant, some are mellow and moist, each has its own characteristics. In addition, there are various teas to choose from, including raw Pu, cooked Pu, jasmine tea, oolong tea and so on. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Tea can be selected based on multiple dimensions such as region, production area, year&lt;/span>; and the factory or craftsman who made it. For young people who are just getting started, it is still very interesting to understand some basic knowledge of tea. It is actually very fun to make some choices in categories and regions, find a few teas that you like, and learn simple tea art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are some things to pay attention to when making tea, such as water quality, water temperature, what utensils to use for making tea, etc. Tea makers still need to know. For example, purple clay teapots are suitable for making black tea, Pu&#39;er tea, oolong tea, Wuyi rock tea, etc., but are not suitable for making green tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Relatively delicate green teas such as Longjing cannot be washed immediately with too hot boiling water. It will destroy the chlorophyll in the tea, causing it to turn yellow and lose its fragrance and taste. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Tea drinking is the eternal track&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, tea has been used by people since its birth Since drinking, the tea preparation methods have never stopped being updated. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From making tea in the Tang Dynasty, to ordering tea in the Song Dynasty, and later to making tea in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, as well as matcha, which was derived after spreading overseas to Japan, etc., in different In the era of tea drinking, the way of drinking tea has gone through changes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In modern times, with the changes in technology and technology, new Chinese tea drinks represented by various milk teas that are familiar to young people today have emerged. In the beverage competition Taozhong offers a variety of sugar-free teas containing tea ingredients, compound tea drinks, and various bagged instant teas, etc. Various types of tea drinks and tea drinking methods are still changing and iterating, and young people are also repeatedly exploring and trying to consume them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For young people who like to benchmark and follow trends, the traditional method of &quot;freshly brewing tea&quot; is very popular due to the cultivation of social platforms, video platforms and the promotion among friends. It has easily become a social symbol and a way of communication, making tea quickly become a lifestyle for young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The preferences and tastes of young people will also be projected into tea-related products, such as tea sets, which may become more youthful, simple and fashionable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the future, I believe there will still be various ways of drinking tea that young people will love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Whether it is the renaissance of making tea or the introduction of new tea drinks in terms of taste, more and more young people are falling in love with and consuming tea-related products. It will further boost the overall market of the tea industry and enrich the tea ecology. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为保住工作买公司产品？企业与员工间应建立合理边界丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261008]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Nio’s layoffs have been a hot topic recently. First, there were rumors in the industry that on November 3, 2023, Li Bin, the founder, chairman and CEO of NIO, stated in an internal letter &quot;Organization Optimization and Two-Year Priorities&quot; that in order to further improve execution efficiency and ensure sufficient resources for key businesses To invest, the company will reduce its positions by about 10%, and specific adjustments will be completed in November. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to NIO’s 2022 ESG report released on September 25, it has a total of 26,763 employees. According to this estimate, more than 2,600 people or more will be laid off this time. Regarding NIO’s layoffs, the mainstream narrative on the market revolves around the situation of the electric vehicle industry or the company itself. This is of course a meaningful perspective. Here we can also get into the perspective of employees. According to China Business News, we learned from NIO’s internal employees that the compensation plan is N+3, which should be good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, a user with the online name &quot;Tangbao&quot; posted on Xiaohongshu, saying that he had worked at NIO for 5.5 years (also known as &quot;became a full-time employee more than a year ago&quot;), which seemed to imply that it was not official before. Worker), nearly 40 years old, with seniors and juniors. He cherishes this job very much. &quot;I often work overtime and stay up all night, all on my own volition. There is no overtime pay and I never complain.&quot; Suddenly, he was told that he was on the layoff list. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;TA alleged that &quot;almost 80%&quot; of Weilai employees have been explicitly or implicitly told that they must buy a Weilai car if they want to keep their jobs. In order to avoid unemployment in middle age, I replaced my Mercedes-Benz CLA, which I bought only two years ago, with a Weilai ET5 before the end of last year. At the end of last year, this person wrote a post titled &quot;One Month of Picking Up the ET5 Car&quot; and said, &quot;In terms of putting users first (the car owner&#39;s father), Weilai is second and no one dares to say that it is first.&quot; This seems to confirm the authenticity of TA purchasing an ET5. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then he wrote: &quot;My boss talked to me and said that if he wants to be promoted, he must mobilize his friends and relatives to buy a car together.&quot; Then he recommended his cousin and cousin to buy them separately. I bought Weilai ES7 and ES6; at the beginning of this year, in order to get a promotion, I took out a loan to buy an ET5. Attached is a certificate of successful purchase and loan, which shows that the total price of the ET5 purchased is 345,200 yuan, of which the loan is nearly 300,000 yuan and the monthly payment is 8,150.56 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He claimed that the monthly payment for his first car, an ET5, was 3,000 yuan, so the monthly car loan was more than 10,000 yuan. This person spent more than 600,000 yuan to buy two ET5s, just to keep it. Job and promotion? Does a family need to buy two ET5s? And the time between two purchases is very short. Therefore, some netizens expressed doubts, and some netizens found it credible and believed that &quot;Nio has a hidden culture of mobilizing employees to buy cars (even linked to performance).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, NIO should clarify: Is this a laid-off employee of NIO? Have you bought two ET5s? This person claimed that &quot;in order to support the company and to stabilize his position, he sold dozens of cars to his relatives and friends, and almost became part-time salesmen.&quot; Is this true or false? Does the company have explicit or implicit rules that require employees to link the purchase of NIO cars to performance, retention and promotion? The media can also investigate these issues to set the record straight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the products produced by the company are good and employees need them and buy them voluntarily, there is no problem. However, if employees are required to purchase a certain number or amount of the company&#39;s products in order to stay and be promoted and receive salary increases, that would be a big problem: to put it mildly, it would be ugly and violate the public-private boundary between the company and its employees, because the company It has no right to interfere with employees&#39; private consumption choices; to put it more seriously, this is a &quot;pyramid sales&quot; of the business-profit model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real money-making routine of MLM organizations is to drain each participant&#39;s personal money, and through brainwashing, let the participants cash in the trust and love of their relatives and friends, that is, to drain the participants of their important interpersonal relationships. monetary value and then throw it away. A large number of systems destroy the social capital of individual participants, and this is the greatest social harm of MLM. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the fact that most people will work in a company or organization after leaving school, there is a question worth discussing: above employees, we are human beings first, how can we keep our job? Basic human principles? Is it because it is difficult to find a job, or you are worried about losing your job, or you want to be promoted, so you can take the initiative to do anything under the explicit or implicit instructions of the company or your superiors? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an employee, especially if you are engaged in a free competition industry, the best strategy to keep your job is always to improve your own strength. I have something that others don’t have, and I have advantages that others have, so that I have some indispensable qualities. Substitutability creates irreplaceable value for the enterprise or makes the substitution cost of the enterprise very high. This strength may be your technical ability, your ability to analyze and judge, or your ability to explore and expand customers. In short, it is best to have the ability to stand alone and give up on others, and to cultivate and maintain your ability to choose. Only in this way can you have the confidence to refuse unreasonable demands from the company or your boss and maintain reasonable boundaries with the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, if your ability, courage or self-confidence are insufficient, and the company or your boss does not insist on using you, then in order to keep your position, you may eat some &quot;flies&quot;, such as asking you to spend a huge amount of money. Use the money to buy the company&#39;s products, allowing you to borrow money or lend to the company. If you go all out and do it, will you definitely get what you want?

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In mid-November 2023, when the chrysanthemums were in full bloom, Zhang Liang, a chrysanthemum farm in Nanyang City, Henan Province, released a video saying that the chrysanthemums grown at home Four to five hundred acres of chrysanthemums are picked and stolen by many people every day. In the video he posted, three people were picking chrysanthemums in the field. Zhang Liang pretended to be a passerby and asked the person who had picked half a plastic bag of chrysanthemums: &quot;This is quite a lot. You are not afraid of others showing up when you pick it here.&quot; ?” The other party replied: “Pick less and pick as you go.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 19, 26-year-old Zhang Liang told Southern Weekend reporters that he was Villagers in Zhangxiu Yuzhuang, Kuofeng Village, Qinghe Town, Fangcheng County, Nanyang City, began contracting land near their homes to grow chrysanthemums in 2017 to process them into chrysanthemum tea. It is now the time when chrysanthemums are blooming and being harvested. Zhang Liang said that there are dozens of cases of stealing every day, and &quot;hundreds of kilograms are lost every day. Like last year, the drones shouted and cursed, and people couldn&#39;t drive them away, which has caused a lot of losses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the video shot by Zhang Liang was posted online, it quickly aroused controversy. Two days later, Zhang Liang deleted the video. He explained: &quot;Some netizens felt that I had discredited Henan people, so I deleted the video. It had nothing to do with anyone.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Lose the face of Henan people&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Liang introduced that the main crops in Fangcheng County are wheat and corn. In 2017, &quot;I saw others planting chrysanthemums, and the profit point was relatively high at the time, so I followed suit.&quot; In July 2021, Zhang Liang established Yicheng Family Farm in Fangcheng County, which mainly grows chrysanthemums. The annual income of chrysanthemums such as Golden Thread Emperor Chrysanthemum, Wuyuan Emperor Chrysanthemum, and Little Emperor Chrysanthemum depends on the market. If the market is good, you can sell more. &quot;But the market has not been good in the past two years.&quot; Zhang Liang&#39;s parents have always taken care of the chrysanthemum field. Zhang Liang, who works outside during the busy farming season, will also come home to help. &lt;p>; At that time, because there were not many chrysanthemums planted in large areas in the local area, many people wanted to do something new. Zhang Liang said that most of the people who came to see the chrysanthemums were people from the surrounding area, and almost all of them were strangers. There were more people on weekends, but he couldn’t estimate how many people there were. “Anyway, they sell noodles, steamed buns and cabbage. , sugar cane juice and other snacks are all set up stalls around here.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are more people looking at flowers, so people are climbing and picking chrysanthemums at will. In a previous video, Zhang Liang said that dozens of incidents of stealing chrysanthemums occurred every day. In the past, fences were built at major intersections, but &quot;gentlemen are blocked, not villains.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that he reported to the police for stealing chrysanthemums in 2022. &quot;The police also came, educated him, and fined him 200 yuan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Liang believes that the reason why so many people come to his chrysanthemum patch is inseparable from the &quot;propaganda&quot; of some local self-media bloggers. Those who make short videos, they spread the word to ten, and then spread the word to hundreds.&quot; In the online world, Zhang Liang&#39;s chrysanthemum field has a name. It is called &quot;Fangcheng Qinghe Chrysanthemum Garden&quot;, and the hundred-acre chrysanthemum garden is also exaggerated into &quot;thousand acres&quot; and &quot;ten thousand acres&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A blogger with the online name &quot;Xie Laoer&quot; once recommended Zhang Liang&#39;s chrysanthemum field on November 12, &quot;Why go to Kaifeng to appreciate chrysanthemums? There are acres of chrysanthemums at your doorstep, and you don’t have to pay for it.” An employee of the “Xie Laoer” account told Southern Weekend reporters that “Xie Laoer”’s job is a tour guide, and he usually posts beautiful views of various places in his account. &quot;Let others know where to hang out.&quot; After the video of picking chrysanthemums caused controversy, the comment section of &quot;Xie Laoer&quot; was not peaceful. Some netizens accused him of &quot;bringing misery to other people who grow flowers.&quot; &quot;Xie Laoer&quot; declined the interview from the Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;I don&#39;t want to explain too much. The more trouble there is, the more trouble there is and it won&#39;t be interesting.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned employee told the Southern Weekend reporter that she felt that &quot;Xie Laoer&quot; did not guide everyone to pick flowers. &quot;He just thought that the flowers were strange and the scenery was beautiful. Ask others to see it. There are only a few people picking flowers, but there are still many qualified people.&quot;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;At the end of &quot;Xie Laoer&quot;&#39;s recommendation video, he emphasized to tourists that &quot;you must not pick other people&#39;s chrysanthemums indiscriminately, cherish the fruits of other people&#39;s labor, and don&#39;t step on them in the fields.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a native of Nanyang, the above-mentioned employee believes that people who randomly pick other people&#39;s flowers can be found everywhere. &quot;It&#39;s not that only Henan has such people.&quot; After learning that the incident was on the news, she became even more angry, angry that those who did not realize it had &quot;lost the face of Henan people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A tourist squatting in the field to pick chrysanthemums.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Defloration exists, but it is very rare”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Liang felt that he had embarrassed the people of Henan and brought shame to the people of Henan. Henan people smeared it. &quot;As a Henanese, I should add glory to Henanese, but I didn&#39;t expect that (posting the video online) would cause so many negative effects.&quot; Zhang Liang explained that only a few people who came to see the flowers picked the flowers. No serious economic losses were caused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 18, Zhang Liang released a clarifying video, &quot;My purpose in shooting the video was to persuade everyone to enjoy the flowers in a civilized manner when they come here to check in and take photos. Unexpectedly, It will cause such a big misunderstanding.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In interviews with Southern Weekend reporters, Zhang Liang had a back-and-forth attitude. He sometimes admitted that all this was his personal fault and he would bear the consequences&lt;span>;,&lt; /span>;Sometimes he is full of anger: &quot;To be honest, sometimes I really don&#39;t want to speak out of conscience, and I&#39;m right.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For my own chrysanthemums to be picked , Zhang Liang’s attitude was equally vague. Sometimes he feels that &quot;people come all the way here, just for fun, picking some is nothing.&quot; &lt;span>;&lt;/span>; Sometimes he feels that &quot;someone really shouldn&#39;t pick it, this is my private property.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of November 19, a staff member of the Propaganda Department of Fang&lt;span>;cheng&lt;/span>; County Party Committee told a Southern Weekend reporter, “Whether the local government is It is impossible for our propaganda department to put pressure on people. But the local government immediately went to understand the situation after seeing the video.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This The staff said: &quot;Their land is a base integrating sightseeing, picking, processing and sales. On weekends or when the weather is good, tourists will come there to check in, but some citizens have some uncivilized behaviors, such as If you want your children to smell the fragrance of flowers, or out of curiosity or as a thought, there are a few people who pick other people&#39;s chrysanthemums. This does exist, but it is definitely a very small minority. It is impossible to say that we &lt;span >; City &lt;/span>; Millions of people in the county are so unqualified, impossible, no existence of robbing or stealing. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; After the incident, the local public security has been involved, and the police force to the chrysanthemum land to maintain order. &quot;The local government has asked the village cadres and party members and cadres in the village to walk into the field and inform citizens who go to sightseeing and punch in. They can be punched here, but they cannot be picked or stepped into the house. It is necessary to ensure that the chrysanthemums contracted by the farmers are not lost. This is the most important. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; Zhang Liang has denied that his chrysanthemum land can be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &quot;Selands&quot; or &quot;picking up&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Stealing chrysanthemum incident is not a case. Reporters from the southern weekend sort out and found that during the 2023 autumn harvest stage, there were many crazy incidents. On October 3, many fans of the Nanyang Music Festival were stolen; on October 14, &quot;100 acres of corn fields were robbed by more than 100 people&quot; in Dancheng County, Zhoukou City; on October 31, Huaiyang District, Zhoukou City &quot;Hundreds of people grabbing medicinal materials&quot; incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On November 19th, Qiu Jun, the party of &quot;hundreds of people grabbing medicinal materials&quot;, recalled in an interview with the southern weekend reporter that on the afternoon of October 31, the machine was underway. In the second time the medicinal materials were harvested, when the receipt of two -thirds, the machine failed to work. At that time, Tianbian had surrounded one or two hundred people, mostly older old people. After the machine could not be harvested, some villagers picked up. Later, there were more and more people. Qiu Jun and he hired more than 20 people who hired &lt;/span>; to dissuade invalidation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Qiu Jun is a large Chinese medicine atractylum planting household in Dailou Village, Fengtang Township, Huaiyang District, Zhoukou City. This year is the sixth year of his planting. To get used to, the leukotus can be picked up in hundreds of acres of land that cannot be harvested by one or two thousand pounds of machines. After the incident, Qiu Jun felt uncomfortable, but unable to dissuade him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Qiu Jun told the southern weekend reporter that after the incident was reported by the media, the local police recovered about 800 pounds of Atractylodes. &quot;People won&#39;t let you enter the ground. You enter, say that you can pick it up, saying that you are not good, this is grabbing.&quot; The horn in the village also broadcasts. Educating everyone &quot;this kind of picking behavior is a bad behavior, violating the law&quot; &quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Looking back and watching this, Qiu Jun believes that &quot;can&#39;t blame the people&quot;. They don&#39;t understand the law, they feel that this thing can be picked up on the ground. Regarding the public opinion caused by the incident on the Internet, Qiu Jun believed that his influence on the local reputation was very bad. During the interview, he continued to correct the wording of the reporter and changed the &quot;grabbing&quot; to &quot;picking up&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Beijing Deheheng (Guangzhou) law firm Zhao Shaohua, a senior partner, is worried that this way of handling may make most of the offenders think that their behavior will not be subject to their behavior. Punishment encourages illegal acts and causes more growers to suffer losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhao Shaohua admits that it is still difficult to qualify for such unauthorized climbing and picking other people&#39;s crops without the consent of farmers. The first is the difficulty of fixing and collection of evidence. Because a large area of ​​crop planting farm is generally in the suburbs, the area is large, and it is difficult to directly fix and collect the direct behaviors of the actor climbing and picking. Difficulty, because some rural areas indeed allow local villagers to pick up a small number of or residual crops left after picking up and harvesting in the plantation site. At the legal evaluation level, &lt;span>; judgment &lt;/span>; whether the actor has illegal possession There is difficulty in subjective purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhao Shaohua suggested that law enforcement in rural areas must break through the wrong understanding of &quot;not blame the public&quot;. &quot;Like some stolen and robbing crops to reach the status, law enforcement operations should be strictly taken according to law, rather than continuing to solve the solution according to the&quot; habit &#39;. To let local villagers know Legal responsibilities, the law does not blame the public will not become the protective umbrella of anyone.

His son Feng was only 14 years old and also joined as a member. Zheng Guanying&#39;s &quot;Yuan Jun · Yuanchen&quot; booklet, which was copied and prefaced, was printed by Hengbinwen through the store. Feng Free&#39;s &quot;Revolutionary History&quot; said: &quot;There are only two propaganda materials of the Shixing Middle School: one for&quot; Yangzhou Ten Diary &quot;, and at the end of the article, the Qing regent Wang Doru and the Ming Pavilion Department Shi Kefa resumed the second book; the second Select the article &quot;Original Jun · Yuanchen&quot; for Huang Lizhou&#39;s &quot;Mingyi to Be visited&quot;.

In June 1897, when Sun Yat -sen was in the UK, he presented the booklet of &quot;Yuan Jun · Yuanchen&quot; to the Japanese friend Southern Xiong Nan. &quot;Original Jun · Yuanchen&quot; is two chapters of &quot;Yuan Jun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot; in Huang Zongxi&#39;s &quot;Mingyi Beauty&quot;.

Mencius said: &quot;The people are expensive, the community is the second, and the monarch is light.&quot; This eternal righteousness, consciously, the future generations are unknown to the righteousness of the monarch and minister, and they are born for governing the people. Gou Dadi has no people, so why never have a king? Why do you have a minister? However, I do n’t know that Lijun is the people, so one person Yan An, the people have lost their troubles; but I do n’t know that Li Chen is also the people, so it is a hundred ministers Ashun, which will lose the benefits. Woo! In this disadvantage, everyone is wrong and everyone cannot know and say clearly. Only Mr. Ming Huang Lizhou, who is loyal and filial piety, Zhuo Yan can articles, look at the long -awaited knowledge, surpassing the ages. Taste the editor of &quot;Mingyi to visit&quot;, attached to the difficulty of Xunzi. There are the two theories of &quot;Yuan Jun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot;.希 Excerpt the printing line, and he was the foundation of Zhang China, and Zhang China was self -reliance. Confucius: &quot;I know that I only have&quot; Spring and Autumn &quot;, and the sinful person is&quot; Spring and Autumn &quot;?&quot; Yi Wei Lixia, Qi worrying about his son Xiaoyin. &lt;/span>; (Quoting from Sun Weihua&#39;s &quot;&quot; Original Jun Yuanchen &quot;Small Introduction Author Test&quot;) &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Who is &quot;Qi Wudong&#39;s son&quot;, the academic circles include Wang Tao, Sun Yat -sen, etc. It is considered Zheng Guanying. Sun Weihua, the Central and South University of Ethnology, made an in -depth research. From Zheng Guanyin&#39;s content of &quot;Shengshi&quot; and the early years of &quot;Yiyan&quot;, &quot;Qi Yan&quot; uses the &quot;Qi worry&quot; pen name. The author retrieved the &quot;Declaration&quot; and found that Zheng Guan should also use the pseudonym of &quot;Tiecheng Qi Shengsheng&quot; to publish poems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Tao used to make a post for Zheng Guanyin&#39;s &quot;Yi Yan&quot;: &quot;Qi worry, I do n’t know who the person is, and Ji Zhi Zhi lives in the iron city, the family Liyang, the footprint is all over the north and the south, and the travel office is the longest for Huadu. . Its land is the crown cover, the businessmen are spoke, and the worries live in it. Broken saliva. Today, Guo Yanxian, Xiangxiang Township, and Wu Chuan, Chen Liqiu, all appreciated, and repeatedly wanted to wipe it. , Zhili Linquan, Mu Huang and Yu, are entertaining and entertaining. &quot;Scholars familiar with Wang Tao and Zheng Guanying are not difficult to find that the style of small quotes is very similar to&quot; Shengshi Affairs &quot;. The sophisticated style is very different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1894, Zheng Guan should contribute to the book of Sun Yat -sen&#39;s book. After Sun Yat -sen&#39;s &quot;rebellion&quot;, Zheng Guan should destroy the close contact with the two. According to Yi Huili&#39;s research, before Sun Yat -sen launched the Guangzhou Uprising in the autumn of 1895, &quot;Zheng Guanye was in Guangdong in May and June&quot;, Emperor Guangxu requested the news of the 2,000ths of the &quot;Shengshi Affairs&quot;. &quot;. At this time, it was in line with the time of Xiao Yin&#39;s &quot;Yi Wei Lixia&quot; (May 6, 1895). Boldly guess that Zheng Guan should give the manuscript &quot;The original Jun · Yuanchen&quot; and the small lead to Sun Yat -sen. After Sun Yat -sen was exiled in Japan, he published the manuscript Feng Jingru. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Yuan Jun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot;, from Huang Zongxi&#39;s &quot;Mingyi Benefits&quot;. &quot;Yuan Jun&quot; criticized the monarch &quot;with my great privately as the grandfather of the world&quot; and &quot;the great harm of the world&quot;. also&quot;. The democratic thoughts elaborated by the two articles are very suitable for Sun Yat -sen to criticize the Qing court, and it also meets the needs of radical improved factions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1895-1898, Kang Youwei and Zheng Guan should have in -depth cooperation. On December 1, 1895, Zheng Guan responded to Wang Tao: &quot;Kang Changsu&#39;s main government ordered to go to Shanghai, set up a strong study bookstore, and asked Mr. Xun at two o&#39;clock in the afternoon ...&quot; Zheng Guanying accompanied Kang Youwei to visit Wang Tao. Zheng Guanye is also one of the main heads of the Student Book Bureau, and his role is intentionally diluted by Kang Liang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liang Qichao later commented in &quot;The History of China&quot; in &quot;The History of Nearly 300 Years of Academic History&quot; and said: &quot;In the Guangxu, a group of friends have printed many people in private as promoting democraticism as a propaganda democraticism. Tools. &quot;In the book&quot; Introduction to the Qing Dynasty &quot;, Liang Qichao also said:&quot; Liang Qichao and Tan Yongjia advocate the republic of the people&#39;s power, then copy it, print tens of thousands, secretly spread, and in the late Qing Dynasty&#39;s thoughts, the sudden thinking of the Qing Dynasty&#39;s thoughts in the late Qing Dynasty Change, very powerful. &quot;Yu Guolin wrote the long article&quot; The Cultural Instructions &quot;for the new version of the Chinese Book Company&quot; Introduction to the Qing Dynasty &quot;, which pointed out that&quot; the &quot;original monarch&quot; and &quot;the original minister&quot; of &quot;Mingyi to visit&quot; were printed into The propaganda of the small book is actually the son of Qi worry. &quot; Liang only mentioned &quot;Mingyi to Be visited&quot; instead of ordering &quot;Yuan Jun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot;, or intentionally. Before the 18900 coup, in the pen with Japanese Shimi Miyazaki (Miyazaki), Sun Yat -sen said that he and Liang Qichao had a set of &quot;secrets&quot;, and they were not afraid of leakage to each other: &quot;Brother wants to send a letter to Shanghai, please Liang Qichao, please, please, please, please Liang Qichao. Or the relatives of the relatives come here. &quot;This shows that Sun and Liang have long been connected, not that Liang Qichao started to communicate after the exile of exile in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liang Qichao and Sun Yat -sen shared Zheng Guanyin&#39;s &quot;Original Jun · Yuanchen&quot; booklet as a promotional tool to reveal the belongings of some historical figures and were not as fixed as imagined. In the late Qing Dynasty, the intellectuals of the revolution have experienced the &quot;improvement&quot; stage more or less. Sun Yat -sen&#39;s book Li Hongzhang was the best proof; Liang Qichao once preferred the revolution; Zheng Guan should not have no idea of ​​&quot;revolution&quot;, but it was inconvenient to make public. The famous articles of Huang Zongxi&#39;s &quot;Yuan Jun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot; can be shared by the progressive forces of various factions. It also shows that after a period of time after the Sino -Japanese War of the Sino -Japanese War, the progressive forces have not found a suitable public opinion weapon. Propaganda tools, revolutionary factions are used to promote revolution, radical improvements, and the urgency of promoting reforms. Huang Zongxi&#39;s historical status suddenly improved in the late Qing Dynasty, which is conducive to publicity and republic of the virtual monarch. Reading English works, they have the idea that they are more powerful than Huang Zongxi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The title is planned by the editor) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国女足的跌宕与辉煌]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261025]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-21 22:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; On the afternoon of November 20, the official official of the Chinese Football Association announced that Shui Qingxia no longer served as the head coach of the Chinese women&#39;s football.

The notice stipulates that persons who live in urban leased houses and handle lease contracts and residential registration shall be applied for collective households during the housing leasing period in Qingdao who have no legal property houses in Qingdao. In a word, you can rent a house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to official data, as of the end of 2022, Qingdao&#39;s permanent population was 10.3421 million, of which the population of the urban area was 7.4061 million; in 2022, the city&#39;s total production value was 149.2075 billion yuan. Entry in Qingdao is attractive for many people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qingdao is not the first big city to implement rental. Earlier, many big cities such as Jinan, Suzhou, and Zhengzhou have issued similar policies, showing that the competition of large cities has entered a new stage. Compared with various methods such as entry, skills entry, academic education, and house purchase, households can be said to be the lowest cost and threshold, which can be said to have the lowest threshold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Except for some large cities (that is, the so -called large cities and the mega cities), small and medium -sized cities have already liberalized household restrictions, but they have not seen any small and medium -sized cities&#39; population. In the final analysis, the flow of population has never been climbed up in accordance with the level specifications, not to say that the village is from the town in the town, the county in the county, the county in the city, and the capital in the city. The village, town, county, or in the city, everyone scrambles to rush to big cities and first -tier cities, and go there to find better opportunities and build a new life. This is &quot;big urbanization&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Big cities also need to continue to supplement fresh blood. To some extent, there is an inner paradox in large cities: on the one hand, it creates a miracle of business and civilization in a highly compressed space. A variety of products and colorful arts are vibrant; but on the other hand, big cities are often in the current status of ultra -low fertility rates, and they are not capable of giving birth to the size of the newborn and young people needed by the city. The foreign population has continued to supplement, and any big city is unsustainable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this sense, the various measures introduced by big cities to attract the net inflow of the population are related to its destiny and future. From the perspective of surgery, when people come, they will rent or buy a house, work to earn money to pay taxes on social security, consume, get married and raise children. They will spend money on children&#39;s education. While supporting themselves and their families Value: Make others earn money, give the government a financial income, and allow retirees to have pensions. From the perspective of the road, big cities are a super -organized body. Every new person is a new cell, which consumes itself and continues and maintains the vitality of the big city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The most ideal situation is that the household registration is as diluted to no sense of existence or even existence. A person moved to a city, had a new residence, found a new job, and naturally became the residents of the city after a period of time. The household is a family. Where is the family, where is the registration, the household registration is the registration of the family. This is the original meaning of the household registration. After the registration of citizens, the household registration is to some extent. As for how much the tax time or amount reaches to have the benefits provided by the local area, it is another matter. Logically, it can be separated from the resident identity or household registration of a city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In recent years, many big cities have continued to relax the threshold of households, in fact, they are constantly moving towards the direction of diluted and weakening household registration. Large cities such as Qingdao have implemented &quot;renting houses&quot;, and there is no requirement for stable work. There are no requirements for academic qualifications, skills, and even property. The written voucher confirmed by residents has been equivalent to the regular formalities of urban residents&#39; identity registration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another (especially the past) factor that leads to a strong household registration system in the big city is the control of the household registration. For example, the real estate purchase restriction policy launched by the housing market. However, with the weakening of the housing market, such controls are in a trend of dismissal. Even in some first -tier cities, purchase restrictions have been shameful to answer in suburbs. Another example is that first -tier cities are regulatory in the name of governance and environmental protection. Beijing implements a lottery, Shanghai is a license auction, and Guangzhou has both. Taking Shanghai as an example, in addition to the city&#39;s household registration, those who currently hold a residence permit and pay social security or individual taxes can also participate in the auction, which is a kind of decoupling with the household registration. Therefore, the trend does not constitute the factors that hinder the weakening of household registration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Overall, the big city is the last fortress of the household registration system. These places dilute and weaken the household registration, and the final obstacle of the freedom of population flows will disappear. Of course, in turn, everyone can come in theory, which does not mean that anyone will come and everyone can come. Whether you can survive in a city depends on your personal strength, or you have a skill, or at least willing to eat hard, or you have a strong bottom of your home, and there is no passion for pure welfare and pure parasitic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The population is in essence, which will also cause an inevitable result, making the efforts of &quot;local people&quot; anti -Chinese entrance examination immigrants and college entrance examination immigrants in some places make meaningless. Because &quot;foreigners&quot; have no threshold to become &quot;locals&quot;, all those who can settle down are &quot;locals&quot;. They can no longer establish strict separation and barriers through household registration. Therefore, there are places in high school and university admission. Where the advantages are, the so -called advantages will be ironed quickly, just like the calories flow from the high temperature to the low temperature part. The potential is inevitable to guide a natural balance or &quot;education fairness&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
