The establishment of the E-Sports Committee is the latest move by the International Olympic Committee to support the development of virtual Olympic sports. From an organizational perspective, this is an organizational-level upgrade of the e-sports contact group established by the International Olympic Committee in 2018, highlighting the IOC’s recognition of the huge development potential of e-sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is still controversial, in recent years, e-sports has become a formal &quot;sport&quot;. In June 2023, Singapore held its first &quot;Olympic Esports Week&quot; and &quot;Olympic Esports Series&quot;, inviting professional and amateur players from around the world to participate in the competition. At the upcoming Asian Games in Hangzhou, e-sports will become an official event of the Asian Games for the first time and will be included in the national medal list. It is an &quot;intellectual event&quot; like chess events, covering 5 PC-side events and two mobile game-side events. Generate 7 gold medals. On July 8, the Asian Olympic Council announced that e-sports will be included in the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The establishment of the International Olympic Committee’s E-Sports Committee indicates that e-Sports is one step closer to officially entering the Olympic Games and becoming a permanent project. It reflects the International Olympic Committee’s further awareness of the value of esports to the Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;E-sports can bring huge benefits to the Olympic Games. In 2023, the global e-sports audience is expected to reach 574 million, with global e-sports revenue approaching US$1.8 billion. The entry of e-sports into the Olympic Games will further expand this revenue. The International Olympic Committee also values ​​this. After all, any organization needs money to survive and develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The foundation of e-sports is the video game industry. Video games originated in the United States in the 1950s. In the 1980s, with the popularization of televisions and the development of computer hardware, they became popular. By the mid-1990s, with the rise of multimedia technology, games entered a period of rapid development. With the advent of the digital age and the popularization of smartphones, the game industry has grown explosively, from the earliest home computer games to today&#39;s multi-platform, multi-user online games. Video games have become the largest industry in entertainment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The revenue of the game industry now far exceeds the movie box office. Affected by the epidemic, the global movie box office has just exceeded 21.4 billion US dollars in 2022. Before the epidemic, the global movie box office in 2019 was 42.5 billion US dollars. It&#39;s the highest record. Looking back at the gaming industry, according to a report released by market research organization Newzoo, the global gaming market revenue is estimated to be US$187.7 billion in 2023. Among them, the mobile market is expected to reach US$92.6 billion, which also reflects the status of mobile games in the gaming industry. From an audience perspective, globally, the number of game players will grow from 2.9 billion in 2020 to 3.5 billion in 2025, with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 4.2%. There is a view that the huge market size and audience size make games the ninth art after the eight major art forms such as painting, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry (literature), dance, drama, and film (film and television). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of the game industry gave birth to e-sports. More and more players not only play games, but also watch game competitions. To a certain extent, this is the “sport” with the largest number of participants and the best mass base in the world. Whether it is traditional client games or emerging mobile games, they all play an important role in e-sports events. For example, the Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports projects include League of Legends, Honor of Kings Asian Games version, Peace Elite Asian Games version, and FIFA Online 4. These games are the games with the largest audience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of the broad base of video games, e-sports has become a bridge between the Olympic Games and young groups. Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee, said, &quot;Virtual sports can supplement and strengthen the potential of traditional Olympic sports, and it will provide new opportunities for athletes and spectators to participate in the Olympic movement.&quot; “We believe that virtual sports can help promote the values ​​of excellence, friendship and respect that are at the heart of the Olympic Games and can inspire young people around the world to participate in sport and develop active and healthy lifestyles.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it should be noted that the interest game of e-sports entering the Olympics is more complicated than traditional projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Traditional sports are often born out of sports with a long history. They are not themselves a commercial product, and there are no intellectual property rights or controllers. Therefore, the International Olympic Committee can control them relatively independently and completely. . But video games are different. They were born out of business from the beginning. As a sports industry that integrates entertainment, technology, competition, live broadcasting, and social networking, e-sports has achieved mature operations and formed a relatively complete industrial chain. This means that e-sports itself is &quot;owned&quot;. In addition to game manufacturers, each link in the industry chain itself has a mature business model to undertake a series of benefits generated by being an Olympic project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, to a certain extent, when e-sports enters the Olympics, there is a complicated game of interests and a battle for control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While establishing the e-sports committee, the International Olympic Committee also reiterated their definition of e-sports: e-sports is virtual sports (Esports based on Traditional Sports), not gaming e-sports (Gaming) Esports). &quot;Virtual sports&quot; are a supplement and enhancement of &quot;traditional Olympic events&quot;, a supporting role of traditional sports, and will still accept the all-round leadership of traditional sports forces. Judging from the member structure of the Olympic Esports Committee, the same is true. Most of them come from individual sports federations and senior marketing and media personnel in the traditional sports industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the International Olympic Committee insists on two points and will not give in. First, traditional sports must lead e-sports; second, competition content must comply with Olympic standards, and manufacturers must compromise on the red line of game content review. Based on these two points, the International Olympic Committee may require the selection of games or even customize games with its own intellectual property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But at the same time, Olympic projects must also be selected from games on the market, otherwise there will be no audience. This dependence not only refers to game manufacturers, but also includes sales networks, marketing, live broadcasts, and video platforms. Therefore, the Olympic Committee cannot do without the e-sports industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a completely new situation. The tug-of-war over the inclusion of e-sports in the Olympics will continue for a long time, which will also affect the schedule for e-sports to eventually enter the Olympics as an official event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[开幕前夕，南周记者探访亚运主媒体中心，打卡亚运灯光秀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257306]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/feZ3faeodBYoUOUsBHkXT2KsjB0x8PG0LdHR2pps.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/feZ3faeodBYoUOUsBHkXT2KsjB0x8PG0Ld HR2pps. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251534&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, 2023, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, a young man raised his mobile phone to take pictures Light show in Qianjiang New Town. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/ TvkAafdG4SSIvpvXbdhqUs7bz10NG4OrecmTMy4s.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;676&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/TvkAafdG4SSIvpvXbdhqUs7bz10NG4OrecmTMy4s. jpg&quot; data- key=&quot;251535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, a franchise store in the main media center of the Asian Games, a A customer is selecting Asian Games souvenirs. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 19th Asian Games will open in Hangzhou, Zhejiang on September 23, 2023.

They took many detours, and the things they did had mixed results. But one thing is certain. To deal with anxiety and confusion, you need to love specific people and do specific things. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678020932391808&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;People Weekly Issue 766 Youth Power Farming Youth Video.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/17/nin6297U3XcYZ0GTcZFiIkMcj8BF9CvC6HIqh8H6.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/4490302e5576678020932391808 /zXf5dFntkOYA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot; 360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/4490302e5576678020932391808/zXf5dFntkOYA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;20221 1 On March 19, 10 young people came to Houdoumen, Shanlian Village, Sandun Town, Hangzhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They may be debut artists, but live in a hazy life; or they may have been in a boy band for several years, but their lives have lost direction, and their days and nights are upside down; those who have graduated are faced with a crisis of choice; those who have switched from amateurs to become actors, Lose yourself in each role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, their original life was cut off, and they were thrown into rotten fields, where they had to harvest rice, dig ditches, and sow 120 acres of wheat. Under the guidance of their master, they set up two greenhouses, one planted cherry radish, snow greens, and peppers, and the other planted 4,000 pots of roses. They raised 8 ewes, 22 male lambs, 200 kilograms of shrimps, etc. They re-tiled the floor and painted the walls of the house. Zhao Xiaotong, who is good at drawing, painted cartoon images of 10 of them on the exterior wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/fY5oLodvrUNeg3oH5Pq5PmGeIDffhN8tCIFBoZAO.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/fY5oLodvrUNeg3oH5Pq5PmGeIDffhN8tCIFBoZAO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250539&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;10 young people established a company called &quot;Ten Qintian&quot;, and they wore their own customized work clothes&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(&quot;Farming Bar&quot; program group/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For related reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/254587&quot;>;10 young people, 142 acres of land, a 200-day life tempering experiment&lt;/a>;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;On the surface, &quot;Farm!&quot; &quot;Youth&quot; is a documentary program whose main content is agricultural work and rural life. But what attracts the audience is the fact that 10 frustrated and confused young people who don&#39;t know each other go through trials together with the hope of working hard to do one thing well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 21, 2023, the company of 10 young people was officially established, called Shiqintian, which is a homophone of &quot;Ten Sunny Days&quot;, because they communicated in desperate moments on rainy and snowy days. I always want to wait for a sunny day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audience was moved by the sweat, blood and energy of the 10 young people to overcome difficulties. Life on the screen provides the audience with a beautiful parallel time and space: there is no elimination mechanism, and there is little competition between people; young people are allowed to be kind to others, help each other, and keep trying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the middle of the show, some viewers said that Houdoumen was a utopia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before entering the entertainment industry, Zhao Yibo was a standard social animal. He worked in an advertising company and was always in a competitive relationship. The price of saying the wrong thing may be losing the client he has worked so hard to maintain. He entered the back door in 100% working condition, but unexpectedly he relaxed here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Jiang Dunhao, who had always been slow to show off, came here, his inner barrier to interacting with others was lowered. Chen Shaoxi, who always lives alone, solves his serious mental internal conflict here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Zhuo wants to do things well, but always makes mistakes. Raising roses is stressful, and he is worried about not doing well in every step. The brothers stayed up late with him to make flowers on the assembly line, but he felt guilty for causing trouble to others. Li Hao, who is good at observing people, noticed Lu Zhuo&#39;s emotions of thinking about others but suppressing himself. In a commercial, Li Hao filmed Lu Zhuo as a clown who closed the door to heal himself, opened the door and infected everyone with his smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Haonan hopes that everyone will be happy, stay together happily, and often help others without asking for anything in return. Zhao Xiaotong is stubborn, but everyone is willing to accommodate his stubborn character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One morning in May 2023, Zhuo Yuan was wearing a supermarket uniform and watched the hydroponic lettuce they grew being packaged, weighed, and put on the shelves. After the supermarket opened, the lettuce was quickly sold by early-morning customers. Older people and viewers who know ten days are short. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Housoumen has become a landmark. Li Gengyun built a flower bed for Houdoumen, planted several kinds of plants, and watered them every day. Some of them bloomed overnight, and some bloomed for a short period of time and faded in two days. But after they were cut off, new ones bloomed. The buds will grow, and &quot;life comes one after another, passed on over and over again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yiheng thought of the smell of Houdoumen and described it as &quot;the smell of vitality.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“灵活就业”的毕业生，和一轮针对性核查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257294]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在“被强奸”漩涡中挣扎八天后，一位44岁农妇选择自杀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257255]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The old house hidden under the trees, Yi Yonghong&#39;s self-report of being &quot;raped&quot; The place where the incident occurred.

I just hope that you will live a happy life and forget that I am a bad wife and mother.&quot; .&quot; She said in her suicide note. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To commit suicide, she chose a mile away. She had to pass through a large guava field. The unripe fruits wrapped in white plastic bags were hung all over the orchard. They were the fruits of her summer. The guava tree is not high, so you have to bend down when walking through it, and you have to cross a drainage ditch in three to five steps. The last section of the road is a slope about two meters high. Climb up and you will reach the embankment. A wide pond with a wide water surface slowly unfolds in front of you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The embankment is covered with mimosa, lush and green. The pair of pink slippers were neatly placed on the steps by Yi Yonghong, with the toes facing the pond. A few hours later, her husband Cheng Shanzhi discovered her. She was wearing a red top and floating in a prone position in the middle of the pond. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Eight days before committing suicide, at the age of 44, she reported that she was raped by fruit vendor Huang Mouguan. The police decided not to file the case because the existing evidence could not prove that a crime had occurred. After committing suicide, the police decided to open a case for investigation on September 7 because &quot;new evidence was discovered.&quot; In order to prove that she was raped, she was preserved in an ice coffin and underwent a craniotomy and a thoracotomy for an autopsy. &lt;/p>;&lt;h4>;Misfortune in the banana fields&lt;/h4>;&lt;p>;Typhoon Taili is approaching. Before the violent storm arrived, Yi Yonghong had to cut down more than 20 acres of plantains at home. Nine years ago, this couple from Yongzhou, Hunan, planted fruits on a contracted land in Wenchang, Hainan. Now the contracted land covers nearly 50 acres, half of which is planted with bananas and the other half with guava. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yi Yonghong’s WeChat chat records show that on the evening of July 14, she and Huang Mouguan finalized the time to harvest bananas the next day. Huang Mouguan opened a fruit wholesale stall near the busiest park in Wenchang, and would go to fruit farmers&#39; homes to buy fruit. In the Wenchang area, most of the fruit growers are outsiders who have crossed the Qiongzhou Strait to make a living, and most of the fruit vendors are Hainan locals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yi Yonghong rarely goes out in public to sell bananas, and spends most of her time working in the banana fields. In early 2023, Yi Yonghong&#39;s husband Cheng Shanzhi started doing business with Huang Mouguan after being introduced by a fellow villager. By the time the incident occurred, he had sold bananas to him five times in total, with a transaction volume of 1,480 yuan. In the first two times, Cheng Shanzhi cut down plantains and traded them with Huang Mouguan. Because her husband&#39;s left ankle was seriously cut due to an accident, Yi Yonghong took over the job of cutting plantains for the next three times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was these three experiences of selling bananas alone that pushed Yi Yonghong&#39;s life to a point of no return. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The banana land contracted by Yi Yonghong and his wife is not close to the village where she rents, and it takes half an hour by electric bicycle. In 2014, they built a shelter house using hollow bricks next to the plantain field. There was no other house within a radius of 200 meters. When we moved out in 2022, there was only a guard dog and a few free-range chickens left there. The unused old house began to fall into dust and became desolate. There was no longer a fire in the kitchen, and no one could sleep on the bed. Except for resting when working, Yi Yonghong rarely came here. The airtight trees almost swallowed up the small house. house. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The old house at the crime scene.

(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The first time Yi Yonghong took over for her husband who injured his foot and cut bananas alone with Huang Mouguan was on July 2. To cut bananas, vendors usually go to the fields to select the bananas, and the farmers carry them to the field, where they are finally weighed and loaded onto trucks. Yi Yonghong seems to particularly like pink. She has a short-sleeved shirt of this color, which she wears specially when working. Her right shoulder is covered with dark green glue marks from banana. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yi Yonghong later told her husband that that time, Huang Mouguan took the opportunity to help her carry the banana on his shoulders and touched her breasts. He also said to her: &quot;Don&#39;t do such hard work, I will give you money.&quot; Yi Yonghong refused him: &quot;Don&#39;t say this, we are doing hard work to earn hard money, I am not that Plant people.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No more evidence can be obtained for what happened in the banana field. Other merchants next to Huang Mouguan&#39;s fruit shop said they had not seen him for more than a month after the incident. On the afternoon of September 2, Huang&#39;s wife was selling fruit at a stall next to the shop. She was emotional and refused to be interviewed: &quot;You don&#39;t know how much impact they have on our lives. I am under great pressure.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A week later, the bananas had to be picked again, and Yi Yonghong and Huang Mouguan were once again in a deserted place where vegetation was growing wildly&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[古龙：人在江湖，身不由己丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257298]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[交通运输部：中秋国庆假期小型客车免收通行费]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257286]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 10 o&#39;clock today (September 21), the State Council Information Office held a press conference.

Among them, &quot;rumor information&quot; and &quot;leak information&quot; are relatively easy to understand, and the corresponding penalties include &quot;defamation&quot; and &quot;infringement of commercial secrets&quot;. In comparison, the definition of &quot;insulting information&quot; is much shorter: &quot;information that attacks and insults companies or entrepreneurs, spoofs portraits of entrepreneurs, maliciously associates with pornographic and vulgar topics, etc.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of the &quot;Guidelines for Reporting Enterprise-related Internet Infringement Information&quot; is to protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises and entrepreneurs, improve the efficiency of reporting enterprise-related infringement information, and maintain a good business environment. Among them, the formulation of &quot;spoofing entrepreneur portraits&quot; is more attention-grabbing and deserves in-depth analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the basis for &quot;spoofing entrepreneur portraits&quot; is &quot;online infringement information&quot;, which originates from Article 1019 of the &quot;Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, &quot;No organization or individual may vilify or defame, Or use information technology means to forge and infringe on the portrait rights of others.&quot; According to this law, &quot;spoofs of entrepreneur portraits&quot; will constitute infringement if they are proven to be &quot;uglified&quot; or &quot;forged.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, spoofing portraits of entrepreneurs is not necessarily directly equivalent to &quot;vilification&quot; or &quot;forgery.&quot; For example, if an entrepreneur&#39;s portrait is turned into an emoticon or a cartoon character, it does not necessarily constitute &quot;uglification&quot; or &quot;forgery.&quot; Compared with &quot;attacking and abusing entrepreneurs&quot;, &quot;spoof portraits&quot; also have elements of ridicule and humor, and are often beautified and praised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the actual situation, most of the entrepreneurs spoofed by netizens are famous and successful entrepreneurs. They have strong industry influence and social popularity, and they are already public figures themselves. As public figures, entrepreneurs&#39; lives and work have attracted widespread attention, and their words and deeds are closely related to public interests. As a special group in society, the portraits of well-known entrepreneurs have become a piece of &quot;public knowledge&quot; well known to the public. As public figures, they also bear certain obligations of tolerance and bear certain derogation of interests in their portrait rights. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, it is necessary to refine the identification criteria to determine whether &quot;parody images of entrepreneurs&#39; portraits&quot; constitute &quot;insulting information&quot; and &quot;corporate-related infringement information.&quot; This leads to the second question: How will entrepreneurs protect their rights once faced with &quot;spoof portrait pictures&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, complaints from public figures against netizens for “portrait rights infringement” are often concentrated in the entertainment industry. More than one entertainment star has been very angry about &quot;spoof portrait pictures&quot;, which has triggered many legal lawsuits. According to statistics from the &quot;Southern Metropolis Daily&quot; on April 18, 2023, the China Judgment Document Network disclosed 356 civil cases related to celebrities&#39; portrait rights in 2022. Among them, the proportion of celebrities winning the lawsuit is very high, &quot;Ge You complained about &#39;Ge You lying down&#39; &quot;It has an almost complete winning rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparatively speaking, entrepreneurs encounter spoof portraits. Almost no well-known entrepreneur can escape the &quot;spoof&quot; of netizens, such as Lei Jun&#39;s &quot;are you OK&quot; and Wang Jianlin&#39;s &quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the hundreds of millions&quot;, Robin Li &quot;what&#39;s your problem&quot;, etc. However, the leading entrepreneurs who were pranked did not feel that this was an insult or infringement on themselves, and they did not take legal action. Not only that, some entrepreneurs will actively join in the spoof and use it as a marketing tool to get closer to consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the alleged infringement liability of &quot;spoof portrait pictures&quot;, most of them belong to personality rights disputes, and the most serious cases point to the &quot;crime of insult&quot;. Article 246 of the Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China stipulates that the crime of insult refers to &quot;the use of violence or other methods to openly tarnish the reputation of others and the circumstances are serious.&quot; The crime of insult is a crime of circumstance. The perpetrator&#39;s behavior of openly insulting others must reach the level of &quot;serious circumstances&quot; to constitute a crime and be investigated. This crime falls under the category of &quot;no complaint, no action&quot;, that is, no action will be taken until a complaint is made, except for cases that seriously endanger social order and national interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If entrepreneurs themselves are spreading their own spoof portraits, emoticons and even ghost videos, it is naturally even less likely that the outside world will consider this to be an infringement of the entrepreneur. Therefore, as long as the entrepreneur himself does not feel dissatisfied, similar behavior should be tolerated. If an entrepreneur really believes that &quot;spoof pictures&quot; are insulting or infringing, then he certainly has the right to initiate legal proceedings and use legal weapons to protect his legitimate rights and interests like ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, we can see that well-known entrepreneurs generally have a tolerant and generous attitude towards life when faced with attacks, abuses, and pranks. After all, compared with the turbulent waves of the business world, &quot;portraits being pranked&quot; are sometimes an extra boost for entrepreneurs and a small comment on the &quot;entrepreneurial spirit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[苦等五年，第二批罕见病目录公布：新增86个病种]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257274]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 13:15:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/Cig8PapifnL34jPiIf4CiVkuwLzvF8PVvESVrRTB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1082&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/Cig8PapifnL34jPiIf4CiVkuwLzvF8PVvESV rRTB. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251495&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 7, 2022, Xiamen Maternal and Child Health Hospital, medical staff sampled rare diseases Noxinaxen Sodium Injection, a specific drug for spinal muscular atrophy, is ready to be injected into children. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 20, 2023, the official website of the National Health Commission announced the second batch of rare disease catalogs. Add 86 rare diseases such as achondroplasia to the catalog, and the registration date is September 18. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“(This is) something that everyone has been calling for for a long time.” For Huang Rufang, founder of the Coude Rare Disease Center, as well as many rare disease patients and related medical professionals, this is a five-year battle. Much eager waiting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2018, five departments including the National Health Commission jointly formulated the &quot;First Batch Rare Disease Catalog&quot;, which for the first time disclosed 121 rare diseases to the public in the form of a catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This catalog provides an important basis for various departments to formulate policies related to rare diseases. The health department organizes efforts to clarify diagnosis and treatment guidelines for these diseases one by one, and relies on industry organizations to carry out training for medical personnel to improve the standardized diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. ability. At the same time, a series of supporting systems have been introduced to strengthen the research and development of rare disease-related drugs, accelerate review and approval, and access to medical insurance, which have greatly improved the current situation of rare disease diagnosis and treatment in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, a total of 207 rare diseases have been included in the two batches of rare disease catalogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/E5gEIt4kPP1SGOGXeuadq6Dpjbou9c1Y4Hh1lnJl.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;914&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/E5gEIt4kPP1SGOGXeuadq6Dpjbou9c1Y4Hh1lnJl.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251496&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture of the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Many I have never heard of the disease.&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;To be honest, I have never heard of many diseases, and I don’t know what to say.&quot; Xing Huanping of Meier SMA Care Center saw She told Southern Weekend reporters after the second batch of rare disease catalogues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 20 million rare disease patients in China, the SMA (spinal muscular atrophy) patients helped by Xing Huanping are lucky to have technological breakthroughs from pharmaceutical companies and good opportunities from government reforms. In 2018, SMA was also included in the first batch of rare disease catalogs, and two innovative drugs for symptomatic treatment were approved for marketing in China and entered the national medical insurance catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many rare disease patients and families who were not included in the first batch of catalogs are looking forward to the second batch of catalogs being released, hoping that their diseases will be included in the catalog, so that everyone can at least be seen and have access to the list. More hope.&quot; Xing Huanping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past five years, all sectors of society have paid close attention to the expansion of this &quot;niche&quot; directory, and the National Health Commission has also disclosed the progress. In February 2022, the &quot;Reply to Recommendation No. 9415 of the Fourth Session of the Thirteenth National People&#39;s Congress&quot; published on the official website of the National Health Commission mentioned that the selection process for the second batch of rare disease catalogs has been launched in due course in accordance with regulations and is in the process of material review. stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to that time, the National Health Commission had successively received applications for adding disease categories submitted by relevant departments, &quot;more than 200 copies of relevant materials.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why are these rare diseases included? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are more than 7,000 rare diseases in the world, and there are more than 1,000 rare diseases in China. Therefore, catalog selection needs to be very cautious and scientific. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Working Procedures for Formulating the Catalog of Rare Diseases&quot; issued by the National Health Commission in May 2018, the catalog should be formulated based on national conditions and fully combined with factors such as economic development, population situation, and social security levels. And refer to the management experience of countries or regions with similar social development levels to our country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The diseases included in the catalog should meet the following conditions at the same time: there is international and domestic evidence that the incidence or prevalence is low; it is harmful to patients and families; there are clear diagnostic methods; there are treatment or intervention methods , affordable, or there is no effective treatment or intervention but it has been included in the national scientific research project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in November 2019, the China Rare Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Service Information System established and developed by the National Health Commission was put into use, and 324 hospitals in the National Rare Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Collaboration Network began to use the system to register rare disease cases. Work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This system has collected information on about 500,000 rare disease patients. This information is of great significance for gradually understanding the number and distribution of rare disease patients in my country, diagnosis and treatment bottlenecks, disease burden and difficulties, etc. It has important guiding value for government departments to formulate a more scientific and reasonable national strategic plan for rare diseases.&quot; the National Health Commission mentioned in the aforementioned reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There will be more challenges in the future”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ma Tao, Executive Secretary of the Beijing Sickness Challenge Charity Foundation, learned that the second batch of catalogs was announced, and the first Immediately, I forwarded the news to the WeChat group where my colleagues and the person in charge of the patient organization belong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“On the whole, some of the diseases included in the second batch of catalogs have related patient organizations. These rare disease patient organizations have also done a lot of appeals in recent years, and everyone’s efforts have finally come to fruition. .&quot; Ma Tao told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After calming down, Ma Tao, who has been paying attention to rare diseases for many years, thought that the release of the second batch of catalogs might be the beginning of another long journey. How to diagnose, treat, protect and return more diseases to society requires joint attention and investment of resources from all walks of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that in addition to rare disease organizations, some pharmaceutical companies with related rare disease drug research and development also successively forwarded news of the second batch of catalog announcements on the 20th, such as Zai Lab, Langyu group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There will be more challenges in the future. For the Pain Challenge Foundation team, our service scope and service capabilities also need to quickly adjust and improve, and continue to work hard.&quot; Ma Tao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/lrktG44jOOsvFv6MGB3BeOCFImNK4k0GmWYA4lAm.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;984&quot; height= &quot;1152&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/lrktG44jOOsvFv6MGB3BeOCFImNK4k0GmWYA4lAm.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251497&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/xTVCDAsUlGlKwYhATyMOTbndqtmWN86cFIIMJfxX.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;958&quot; height=&quot;1174&quot; data-src=&quot;//images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/xTVCDAsUlGlKwYhATyMOTbndqtmWN86cFIIMJfxX.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251500&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/09/21/odwQpM9PwOk0QfEGV1yAfwXjkVUxWKGa5xxp2s6Q.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;966&quot; height=&quot;1172&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/odwQpM9PwOk0QfEGV1yAfwXjkVUxWKGa5xxp2s6Q.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251498&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Screenshot/picture of the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/V0dpaBgEqDAfsmKEB5WCxy6jOvBiogAMhDqrBF0W. png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;948&quot; height=&quot;1170&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/V0dpaBgEqDAfsmKEB5WCxy6jOvBiogAMhDqrBF0W.png&quot; data-key= &quot;251499&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture of the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/TsYEQMGbCvSpIMNw7927zlhOaQunMAzCsHpssWuj.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;948&quot; height=&quot;1054&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/TsYEQMGbCvSpIMNw7927zlhOaQunMAzCsHpssWuj.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251501&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“特产互寄”走红，不出门体验当地特色，真的香吗]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257222]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广州多区取消限购，买房不再受户籍和社保限制]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257250]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 11:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/F9TJYfwjWZ9iJm0jvRlDsk1tav3YuMXNvpnEy8EH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;654&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/F9TJYfwjWZ9iJm0jvRlDsk1t av3YuMXNvpnEy8EH. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251493&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Huangpu District in Guangzhou is one of the three districts where purchase restrictions have been relaxed this time. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You can buy as many sets as you want, anyone can buy them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;On September 20, 2023, Guangzhou released new real estate regulation policies. Li Yujia, chief researcher of the Guangdong Provincial Housing Policy Research Center, was invited by relevant departments to write relevant comments one day in advance. He learned that Guangzhou, except for core areas, has lifted purchase restrictions, and buying a house is no longer subject to household registration and social security restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that Guangzhou has become the first city among China’s first-tier cities to relax purchase restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Notice of the General Office of the Guangzhou Municipal People&#39;s Government on Optimizing Policies for the Stable and Healthy Development of the City&#39;s Real Estate Market&quot;, the purchase restriction areas only mention parts of Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, Nansha and Baiyun Districts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these 6 districts, households registered in Guangzhou are limited to purchasing 2 units; households not registered in the city are limited to purchasing 1 unit after paying social security for 2 years, and the time to pay social security is shortened from 5 years to 2 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, only two of the 11 districts in Guangzhou, Conghua and Zengcheng, had no purchase restrictions.

Not long ago Foreign customers who are in a hurry to buy a house come to inquire about the qualifications for buying a house. After seeing the news, Zheng Yang immediately contacted the other party and said that the house that was not available for purchase more than an hour ago can now be purchased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Yang said that the company has not had time to react and the price has not been adjusted for the time being. Due to sluggish sales, the price of this property was lowered some time ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huangpu District is about 30 kilometers away from the city center. It is one of the gathering places for home buyers in Guangzhou. Other areas where purchase restrictions have been lifted are similar to Huangpu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that Guangzhou currently maintains purchase restrictions mainly in the four central urban areas of Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan and Tianhe. These areas were developed earlier and are mainly housing stock, with low elasticity of supply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Baiyun is close to the central area and has convenient transportation. It is located in the sub-periphery. There are many new Guangzhou residents buying homes but the supply is small, and the purchase restriction policy has also been maintained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nansha, which is far away from the central city, aims to create a platform for entrepreneurship, innovation, and livability in the Greater Bay Area. It is an important area for Hong Kong and Macao residents to start businesses and live in the mainland. Therefore, despite the long real estate inventory cycle in recent years, we still insist on purchasing restrictions to reduce dependence on real estate and create conditions for the concentration of industries and talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A real estate project in Nansha is raising prices. A real estate consultant told Southern Weekend reporters that after the new policy is introduced, price adjustments will be implemented faster. By next week at the latest, the average real estate price will increase by 5%-8%. He believes that maintaining purchase restrictions represents the value of Nansha District. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Pay less value-added tax on second-hand houses&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to relaxing purchase restrictions, the new policy also proposes to include Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, Baiyun, Huangpu, Panyu, and Nansha , Zengcheng and other districts have adjusted the value-added tax exemption period for individual sales of housing from 5 years to 2 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as this policy for second-hand houses came out, seven or eight new houses were listed in several communities that Song Ming was responsible for within a few hours, and two owners contacted him to lower the sales price. Song Ming has been a second-hand housing agent in Yuexiu District for eight years and now maintains more than a dozen properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Ming told Southern Weekend reporters that life will not be easy in 2023. The company&#39;s gold medal brokers can only sell one house a month, and many peers cannot sell one in half a year. It is the peak sales season of &quot;Golden Nine and Silver Ten&quot;, and the market is still sluggish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia said that from July to August 2023, Guangzhou’s second-hand housing price index fell among the top 70 cities in the country. The purpose of changing the value-added tax exemption period from 5 years to 2 years is to reduce the cost of transaction links, promote the smoothness of selling and buying, not only satisfy the immediate needs but also ease the demand for house replacement, and ensure the entry of transactions of rigid needs and improvements, new houses and second-hand houses. A virtuous cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the introduction of the New Deal, Li Yujia predicts that in the remaining four months of the year, Guangzhou’s commercial housing market is expected to gradually shift from a continued excessive decline to a bottoming out and stabilizing trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, the Guangzhou New Deal is the implementation of the spirit of the Political Bureau meeting of the Central Committee on July 24, 2023. This meeting proposed that we should adapt to the new situation of major changes in real estate supply and demand, implement city-specific policies and make good use of the policy toolbox, and meet residents&#39; rigid and improved housing needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is not a cyclical change, but a trend change.” Li Yujia said that during the long-term overheating period in the past, the regulatory policies characterized by tightening and demand-side suppression are no longer applicable.
