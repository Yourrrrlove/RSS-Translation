My husband, who works at the same college, received a job opportunity from a 985 university, but the &quot;release&quot; conditions issued by the school&#39;s human resources office were that the husband&#39;s transfer must be approved and the wife must voluntarily resign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue said that this request shattered her more than ten years of hard work. &quot;In their eyes, if I have any value, why don&#39;t they care?&quot; In the end, she chose to fulfill her husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 19, 2022, she signed the dismissal letter and changed from a university associate professor to an unemployed wife. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue provided documents such as recordings of conversations with relevant persons in charge of the school and college, social media communication records, and letters of dismissal as proof. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the case is a road that is not smooth for the mobility of teachers in Chinese universities. In order to retain teachers, universities often refuse them on the grounds that the service period has not expired, graduate guidance and project work have not been completed, or they file claims for high liquidated damages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jin, a doctoral supervisor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Beijing Institute of Technology, has been studying the phenomenon of university teacher mobility for many years. He found that in the West, it is normal for university teachers to &quot;change jobs&quot;, but in Asia it has become more serious. Specific to East Asia, the mobility ratio of university teachers in China is lower than that in Japan and South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Resigned unwillingly&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue, 44 years old, on September 11, 2023, she posted on her personal WeChat account that had been suspended for a year and a half. She published a long article on her blog, describing the heart-wrenching Teacher&#39;s Day she had just experienced: Her former students sent blessings on Teacher&#39;s Day as they did in previous years, but she was unable to tell the story of what happened during last summer vacation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story begins in 2005. Yao Xue and Yang Mu both graduated from a normal university with master&#39;s degrees and joined Linyi Normal University (now Linyi University). After that, they got married and had children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Mu later studied for an on-the-job doctorate and published nearly forty papers and three monographs in 17 years, developing upwards. In 2021, Yang Mu received a job opportunity from a 985 university. In the same year, Yao Xue was finally promoted to associate professor. Different from her husband&#39;s development trajectory, she has taught at least 16 professional courses from sketching plaster statues, oil painting landscapes to basic design, and also opened a general aesthetic education course for all students in the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The career development of both of them will change in 2021, and their lives seem to be going to the next level. Yao Xue plans to stay in Linyi if her husband goes to work in another city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But from the time they received the job offer to Linyi University’s final release, the couple struggled with the school for half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obtaining a transfer letter from a 985 university is only the first step. Inter-school transfers of university teachers must obtain the consent of their department or college, and then report to the personnel department for approval. In the case of professors, the transfer process usually needs to be discussed and approved by the school party committee before the transfer process can be initiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Academy of Fine Arts first rejected Yang Mu’s transfer request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were not many opportunities to discuss transfer applications at the meeting. After missing it at the end of 2021, Yang Mu spent half a year in constant communication, hoping to seize the meeting in mid-2022. Just a week before the meeting, the party secretary of the college, who had already relented, conveyed the opinion of the Human Resources Department to Yang Mu: You want to be transferred and your wife wants to resign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue said that she was &quot;stunned&quot; at that time and she tried to prove to the school that &quot;she was valuable.&quot; During her teaching career, her oil paintings won nearly ten competition awards and exhibition opportunities. &quot;If the school wants to eliminate old teachers, it will never pass on people like me through normal assessment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue originally thought that the school felt that her husband’s transfer would affect her work. She sent a text message to the director of the Human Resources Department to express her attitude: “As a teacher at Linhua University, I have my own professional ethics and career pursuits. Since then, I have worked diligently in teaching and scientific research and have never slackened off.&quot; He also emphasized that whether Yang Mu stays or goes, it will not affect her working status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other party’s reply was to ask Yao Xue and his wife to “understand the school’s desire for talents and the demand for talents in the construction of first-level disciplines and majors.” Moreover, the school also has rules and regulations for the normal flow of talents. “We need to Follow the prescribed procedures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a recording provided by Yao Xue, the other party said that the school has the social responsibility to maintain family harmony and stability, and &quot;does not encourage, do not advocate, and in principle do not engage in separation between the two places.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Service period, scientific research completion and high compensation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What obstacles may a university teacher encounter if he wants to be transferred? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After talking to several teachers who have experienced the &quot;difficulty of changing jobs&quot;, Zhang Duanhong, associate professor at the Institute of Higher Education of Tongji University, learned about a &quot;chain&quot;: the principal, the vice president in charge of human resources, the director of the personnel department, the dean, Secretary, everyone on this line must pay close attention and communicate frequently. A teacher interviewed told Zhang Duanhong: &quot;You must not seek for speed, you must significantly reduce your time expectations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Duanhong analyzed that in communicating with different departments, teachers have to go back and forth and complete their own teaching work. In the end, Physically and mentally exhausted, the mobilization matter fell into place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the difficulty in successfully completing the transfer procedures, teachers have to &quot;change jobs&quot; and the costs they bear include returning the allocated housing and facing huge claims for compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike Yao Xue&#39;s forbearance, Southern Weekend reporters checked the referee documents website and found that some teachers hope to use the law to get rid of their original units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma, a former professor at Yangzhou University Law School, sued the school in 2020 because he wanted to be transferred to Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, but Yangzhou University would not let him go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant judgment shows that Ma mentioned that in April 2020, the registration deadline set by the new unit was approaching, but Yangzhou University Law School refused to sign and release him on the grounds of &quot;college development&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma was introduced to Yangzhou University in November 2011 and has served for eight years. Yangzhou University argued that his service period had not ended - Ma signed agreements in 2013 and 2019 when he obtained the qualifications for higher-level professional and technical positions and the fourth-level professional and technical positions, corresponding to 8 years and 3 years respectively. During the working period, one must &quot;perform the service period honestly and trustworthy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientific research and projects are another means of &quot;stuck&quot; people. In a ruling issued by the Anning District Court of Lanzhou City, Gansu University of Political Science and Law disagreed with the departure of a teacher because the graduate students he supervised had not yet graduated and his own scientific research project had not yet been completed. The school believes that his resignation will &quot;seriously affect the completion of the ongoing research project&quot; and that failure to complete the project on time &quot;will inevitably affect Gansu University of Political Science and Law&#39;s future project application work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some teachers are required to pay a considerable amount of compensation when they leave their original school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;China Science News&quot; once reported that in 2013, after Hu, a teacher at Nanchang Institute of Technology, obtained a doctorate on the job, he signed a new agreement with the school to continue teaching at Nanchang Institute of Technology until June 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the expiration of the service period, Hu applied for resignation and transfer. However, Nanchang Institute of Technology formulated the &quot;Interim Regulations on Personnel Deployment (Revised)&quot; in 2018, which stipulates that teachers at the school need to extend their employment for 5 years after being awarded the title of professor. Annual service period. Hu was promoted to professor in 2016. When he resigned, he still had 2 years and 2 months of unfinished service. He had to pay compensation, which was calculated based on &quot;the average annual pre-tax income in the past three years multiplied by the unfinished service period.&quot; , totaling nearly 440,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a situation where university teachers study for a Ph.D. while on the job, and after graduation &quot;look for another job&quot;, but are blocked by their original school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters searched the Judgment Documents Network and found that Linyi University had sued Xue Li, a teacher at the school&#39;s law school, demanding liquidated damages of 300,000 yuan and other expenses. In 2016, Xue Li went to Heilongjiang University to study for a Ph.D., and Linyi University signed a &quot;Non-directional Doctoral Training Contract&quot; with her. According to the contract, Xue Li will be responsible for all expenses during her studies. The school will pay her salary in the form of a loan. After Xue Li obtains her doctorate, she must report back to Linyi University on time. If she is transferred during the service period, the borrowed salary and reimbursement will be borne by her. After the funds are written off according to the actual number of months of service, the balance will be returned to the school in full, and a penalty of 300,000 yuan will be paid. After Xue Li graduated, she joined Anyang Normal University. Linyi University then demanded that Xue Li return the &quot;borrowed wages&quot; and pay liquidated damages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;couple bundling&quot; method of retaining people, Yang Mu and Yao Xue were indeed caught off guard. Southern Weekend reporters interviewed several scholars who study the mobility of university teachers, and they also said they had heard of it for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there is one exception. Liu Jin added that if the school provides a job for the spouse of a college teacher when the teacher is introduced, then whether the spouse’s job will be retained after the employee leaves the job must be based on the written agreement at the time of talent introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to ensure that the introduced talents have no worries, colleges and universities usually &quot;assist&quot; their spouses in solving their problems. The intensity of &quot;assistance&quot; depends on the talent&#39;s own ability level and the spouse&#39;s own academic qualifications. Southern Weekend reporters noticed that Huangshan University’s 2023 talent introduction plan mentioned that “if high-level talents leave, their spouses must leave at the same time.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue said that she was unmarried when she joined the company as a master&#39;s student in 2005 and lived in a single dormitory, which did not fall into the category of &quot;disposed of work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Duanhong found that teachers rarely resolve obstacles encountered during transfer through judicial channels. The main reason is that they are afraid of breaking up with their original units and leaving a bad reputation. However, according to a review of the judgment documents website, it can be found that the court usually fully considers the position of university teachers. In the aforementioned lawsuits related to Yangzhou University and Gansu University of Political Science and Law, the court ruled that the teacher should terminate the personnel contract relationship with the original school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Xue Li&#39;s case, the court held that Xue Li assumed the responsibility of a university teacher and the salary she received was labor remuneration, and Xue Li&#39;s admission to the &quot;non-directed training doctorate&quot; meant that her future workplace was uncertain. , a two-way choice will be implemented after graduation. Therefore, Xue Li only needs to refund the social insurance and provident fund paid by Linyi University after joining Anyang Normal University. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Brain drain, the dilemma of colleges and universities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why are colleges and universities &quot;stuck&quot; at all levels? This is closely related to the development difficulties and teacher shortages that schools will face after the brain drain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Universities in the central and western regions were once the areas hardest hit by the loss of teachers. In March 2020, Zhao Xudong, then director of the Teacher Affairs Department of the Party Committee of Lanzhou University of Technology, revealed to the media: According to incomplete statistics, 49 universities in Gansu Province lost 2,600 talents from 2012 to 2017, which is about one-third of the number of introduced talents. one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Liu Jin found that in the past 10 years, there has been an &quot;inflection point&quot; in the mobility of teachers in eastern and western universities: the participation of teachers in western universities has greatly reduced, and has been replaced by local or international teacher mobility in eastern universities. In recent years, this trend has become more obvious. Liu Jin analyzed that perhaps eastern universities prefer star scholars with academic competitiveness and reputation, while the brain drain of western universities has reached a plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to Yang Mu, the core logic of teacher mobility in colleges and universities today is &quot;people go to higher places.&quot; In &quot;double-non&quot; colleges and universities, teachers have a strong desire to move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jin found that income is not the most important factor affecting the mobility of college teachers. Their pursuit of academic prestige sometimes makes up for the lack of income. Choosing a higher-ranked school is exactly the way to improve academic prestige. way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At Linyi University, the dilemma of brain drain is equally real and needs to be solved urgently. The school’s “14th Five-Year Plan” mentioned that “there is still a shortage of leading academic talents, young academic talents and high-level innovative teams, and the brain drain in some disciplines is serious.” In 2019, Li Yingkui, then deputy director of the Personnel Office of Linyi University, wrote an analysis that the school had no advantages in terms of schooling level and geography, and had long lacked sufficient funds to introduce high-end talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A teacher who taught at the school from 2017 to 2021 revealed that many teachers with doctoral degrees resigned at the school. The teacher said that he was required to hand in his doctoral diploma when he joined the job. and original degree certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school had more realistic considerations in the transfer of Yang Mu and his wife. According to Yao Xue, the director of the Human Resources Department once mentioned to Yang Mu, &quot;I heard that I will apply for a master&#39;s degree next year. If you leave, it will be ruined.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of the Academy of Fine Arts of Linyi University shows that the academy held a promotion meeting for the construction of professional master&#39;s degree programs in April 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This puzzled Yao Xue. She explained that what the college applied for this time was a professional master&#39;s degree, not an academic master&#39;s degree. Yang Mu&#39;s achievements were all theoretical articles, and it was useless to apply for a professional master&#39;s degree. &quot;On the contrary, I, as a member of the tutor team applying for the master&#39;s degree, was the only one under 45 years old. As an associate professor and technical teacher, my results are useful.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a document issued by the National Art Professional Degree Graduate Education Steering Committee, Southern Weekend reporters noted that the Education Steering Committee’s guidance on professional degree The requirement for direction instructors is that they “must have educational background and practical experience in the major they are guiding.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Duanhong’s view, making it more difficult for colleges and universities to “change jobs” is not necessarily to keep anyone, but more “to slow down the flow of talent and balance it with the speed of recruitment.” He pointed out that if universities really want to retain students, they should create better working conditions for teachers. If teachers are allowed to &quot;leave with love,&quot; they will try their best to give back to the school in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jin encountered examples of &quot;peaceful breakup&quot; in his research. After a teacher &quot;changed jobs&quot;, the doctoral students and postdocs he taught at the original school still studied with him. This teacher also regularly goes to the original school to participate in academic activities and secures many resources for the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is free academic mobility a good thing? After reviewing the history of European medieval universities, Liu Jin found that the difficulty in mobility of graduates from low-prestige universities had attracted the attention of the authorities and promoted the establishment of teacher licensing and degree-granting normative systems, while academic mobility was mostly based on prototype universities. Derivative universities are mainly based on outward transportation and radiation, and are built through mobility. Since most academic career subjects come from prototype universities, it also drives the transmission of academic career norms, thereby maintaining a high level of standardization in the entire industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the director of the Human Resources Department of Linyi University, hoping to learn about the other party&#39;s request for Yao Xue to resign. The other party said that he would contact the school&#39;s Propaganda Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of press time, the Propaganda Department of Linyi University had not responded to interview requests. During the call, a staff member expressed that he did not want to create more pressure on Teacher (Yao Xue). &quot;We are protecting the teacher (attitude). Although she has resigned now, she is still our alumnus.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;tied&quot; spouse&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue does not want the focus of the incident to be shifted to the couple, let alone Wanting to be considered a &quot;hostage of her husband.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident was posted on the Internet, she responded to almost every question raised by netizens. One of them is: &quot;You don&#39;t need to look to know that his wife is a buy one, get one free.&quot; &quot;Buy one, get one free&quot; refers to the aforementioned situation of introducing talents to solve the spouse&#39;s work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue commented: They do not believe that a female teacher has independent value and dignity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her narration, she had a rich and enviable life: after graduating from her undergraduate degree, she was recommended to become the first batch of master&#39;s students at her alma mater; in the past 17 years, her teaching quality evaluation has been excellent 13 times; she could have gone to Zhejiang, Guangdong and other more economically developed regions. But when she applied for Linyi University, the old secretary of the Fine Arts Department received her. As soon as they met, he held her hand and said, &quot;Thank you for supporting the construction of our old district.&quot; This immediately aroused her sense of responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue’s life before resigning could indeed be called “quiet years.” Most of her Weibo is filled with cats, school, and the growth of her children. She also worries about the difficulty of publishing papers and applying for projects as a teacher at a local college, so much so that she prays for success in her projects and papers during some holidays. . When her husband, who has written a lot of books, calls her a scientific expert, she will laugh at herself as a &quot;scientific researcher&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amid the &quot;difficulty in mobility&quot; of university teachers, the situation of female teachers may be even more complicated. In a study on gender differences in teacher mobility at research universities that Liu Jin participated in, the mobility frequency of female teachers at 11 universities including Peking University was significantly lower than that of men. One of the reasons is that female scholars are very worried about being treated differently in terms of income and other aspects during the migration process. A study by a foreign scholar mentioned that female university teachers will lose 8% of their income when they change jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Hui, executive deputy director of the Gender Equality Research Center of Yangzhou University, found that gender differential treatment in colleges and universities is not obvious, but it will become apparent at critical moments related to career advancement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analyzing the performance of male and female teachers at Yangzhou University in terms of scientific research results, professional titles, etc., Yang Hui proposed that teachers’ professional achievements have become gender stratified. For example, women are less common among high-end scientific research groups and high-level administrative managers. . In a 2022 article, Bai Ling, a lecturer at the School of Educational Sciences at Bohai University, studied the teaching staff of a local university and found that male teachers published more papers in Journal C (referring to journals included in the &quot;Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index&quot;) than Female teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yang Hui’s view, once a woman is constrained in childbearing and parenting in a dual-career family that is originally synchronized, the career achievement gap will easily be widened by her partner. In a conversation with the person in charge of the Human Resources Department, Yao Xue learned that there was a teacher couple in a certain college of the school who were in a similar situation at the same time. My husband was going to be transferred to a university in Shanghai, but “my family members refused to leave, and now they have also resigned together.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Yao Xue, the wife graduated from Peking University with a master&#39;s and doctoral degree. On the day when Yang Mu went to school to stamp the last chapter on his resignation procedures, he met the husband who had applied for transfer. The other party told him that his wife had joined the school a year earlier than him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters tried to contact the couple, but the male teacher refused to be interviewed. He said that his wife was not &quot;blackmailed&quot; when she resigned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another netizen left a message: &quot;What I don&#39;t understand is why in both couples, the husband was promoted and the wife was &#39;resigned&#39;. Is it a coincidence or is it really more difficult for women to be promoted and transferred?&quot; Yao Xue admitted: &quot;It may be both. The situation between the two of us is indeed because my spouse&#39;s scientific research ability is much better than mine.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Yao Xue, 44 is an embarrassing age. . When she graduated in 2005, there were still very few master&#39;s degrees in art, and a large number of colleges and universities offered favorable conditions to recruit students. But now the situation has changed. Colleges and universities generally recruit teachers with a Ph.D. degree. As for vocational schools that value practicality, they prefer teachers majoring in design, film and television, and animation. The demand for teachers majoring in oil painting is very limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being unemployed for more than a year, she has not given up on seeking a teaching position. She has received 3 interview opportunities, but no follow-up. She began to take orders for customized oil paintings of pets and portraits as a side job. Although she could not support herself through this, she could find some value in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She still wants to return to the podium, especially when she receives blessings from students on Teacher&#39;s Day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Yao Xue and Yang Mu are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br >;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/ a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[伸手要钱与不受干涉只能择其一：年轻人不能“既要又要”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258937]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Every October is a long holiday, when boyfriends and girlfriends meet their parents, and couples hold weddings. These things are very intensive. There are a lot of good things, but also a lot of bloody plots. Due to differences in customs, conflicting concepts, and disagreements in language, small things often become big problems, causing lovers to quarrel or even break up on bad terms. After the holidays, such complaints can be seen everywhere on social platforms. Reading these words, it seems that you can gain a lot just by eating melon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, I saw such a hotly debated incident: a pair of newlyweds visited each other&#39;s elderly. First, the elderly in the woman&#39;s family gave the man a red envelope of 2,000 yuan. Then he visited the man&#39;s house, and the man&#39;s parents gave the woman 2,600 yuan, which was slightly more, and seemed fine. Unexpectedly, the woman&#39;s brother and sister-in-law were obstructing the situation. They thought the man&#39;s gift was too little and demanded that the gift be doubled in accordance with local customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man thinks it is unreasonable and the woman thinks there is no empathy and consideration. There was a quarrel, the boyfriend and girlfriend blamed each other, each was disappointed, and finally broke up. There are a lot of tragicomedies like this available on the Internet, and there are many more bloody ones than this one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first level of analysis is very simple, it depends on who is causing trouble for no reason or making trouble unreasonably. The woman&#39;s family must obviously bear the responsibility - the brother and sister-in-law are not parents, but they interfere in the sister&#39;s private affairs on the grounds of customs, which is really too lenient. They are suspected of being greedy for money and profit. If such character is not maintained, there will be trouble. Many people congratulate the man for this, saving him a lot of trouble in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second level of analysis: young people fall in love and get married, there are all kinds of frictions, and the deepest collision is values. Values ​​cannot be consistent, and all kinds of things wrapped up in romantic love and personality congeniality will melt away sooner or later. When a man and a woman are in love, especially when discussing marriage, both parties may wish to be more brave and show their personal values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the concept is the same, there will be resonance. The prospective couple or husband and wife will appreciate and respect each other, and the relationship will develop in depth. This is the basis for the lasting and harmonious family relationship. If you have different views, you might as well communicate more and seek to get closer to each other. If the differences are too big, they will break up at best, which is a good thing in the long run. Under this post, many people came to express their congratulations - it was a good break for the two people who had deep differences in their views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a new family, the husband and wife are of the same mind and can avoid internal divisions. How do they avoid external disturbances, especially interference from their parents and families? This is the third level of analysis that we will focus on next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chinese family life, from discussing marriage to getting married, buying a house, and having and raising children, the elders have a great say, but most of them are stubborn. This is a distress faced by many Chinese families. On the one hand, young couples are dissatisfied with their elders. They think they have old-fashioned ideas, weird ideas, lack of skills, are picky and complain, and interfere indiscriminately. On the other hand, the elders also criticize the younger generation a lot, thinking that they are rude, heartless, turn their elbows outward, extravagant and wasteful, lazy and arrogant, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are used to seeing such conflicts: every time we enter a new stage of life, new points of family conflict will appear. It ranges from despising small quarrels to falling apart at worst. Many people think that once the house purchase bill is passed, everything will be solved. However, the conflicts have not disappeared. As money is collected to buy a house and the elderly take care of their children, family conflicts become more intense. In comparison, disputes over red envelopes before marriage are so trivial that they can be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To resolve it, it is actually very simple. A new family is financially independent from the moment it is formed. Don’t be greedy for betrothal gifts and dowry, and don’t put a burden on your parents and family. It sounds incredible, but in fact, most of our parents&#39; generation got married with nothing. At that time, the income was still low, and most people worked hard just to have food and clothing. The burden of distress on contemporary young people only became a phenomenon in recent decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not terrible for young people to be temporarily poor. As long as the family is harmonious inside and outside, and they work hard to make money after marriage, they can still thrive without &quot;family wealth&quot;. On the contrary, some new families are well off and receive support from their elders, but this also involves many conflicts. Husband and wife quarrel, in-laws are at odds, and there is wastage both internally and externally. Many people only see the benefits of betrothal gifts and dowry, but fail to see that forcibly &quot;fighting&quot; for betrothal gifts is actually a huge disaster for marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The family is financially independent and it is difficult for parents to interfere. They didn’t pay, they didn’t pay attention, they couldn’t speak up, and they didn’t have the confidence. If money is given, they must be concerned and have the urge to dominate. Brothers and sisters, as stakeholders, will inevitably speak out. The brother and sister-in-law in the &quot;Red Envelope Incident&quot; are ugly, but they have the right to speak - who told the old man in the family to pay 2,000 yuan as soon as they met, and there will be more later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people understand this truth, but they cannot do it. Under contemporary reality, buying a house requires financial assistance, getting married needs to be organized, and betrothal gifts serve as a start-up fund for a new home and must not be given up. Especially after having children, most couples rely on their parents for help and are far from financially independent. In this case, what should we do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no better way but to accept reality. Young people who are about to get married are already adults. They cannot ask for money while shouting for independence and rejecting the opinions of their parents. This is inconsistent with interpersonal ethics and goes against human nature. Not only do you want financial benefits, but you also need to be free from restraint. The price must be conflicts in family relationships and weakening of family relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many young people do not realize this and point the source of conflicts at the wrongdoings of their elders. In terms of specific matters, some right and wrong analysis may be possible, but as long as the &quot;investment interests&quot; are not equal, conflicts will inevitably continue. It is unreasonable to enjoy both large transfer payments from parents and to be &quot;independent&quot;. To resolve this conflict, there are only two ways to go: achieve financial independence as soon as possible and compensate your elders for their financial contributions; or accept the reality and compromise with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of compromise is not a shame, but a price to pay. On the contrary, those who exploit their parents&#39; wealth in the name of independence, take advantage of both sides and ignore their parents&#39; inner pain, are the ones who really deserve to be despised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[14万病例，2年PK，集采仿制药疗效和安全性怎么样？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259061]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/21/a4c26c75fa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 21/a4c26c75fa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254816&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;For a true and comprehensive understanding of the safety and effectiveness of selected generic drugs in centralized procurement In response to the epidemic, the National Medical Insurance Administration organized medical institutions to conduct real-world research on the clinical efficacy and safety of the second and third batches of generic drugs selected for national mass procurement. Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After two years of &quot;big PK&quot;, a study covering 29 medical institutions in 16 provinces across the country and about 140,000 real cases showed that &quot; The clinical efficacy and safety of generic drugs selected through centralized procurement are equivalent to those of original drugs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2018, 8 batches of state-organized drug procurement have been carried out across the country, involving 333 kinds of drugs, with a total use of more than 216 billion tablets/tubes. A large number of selected generic drugs have entered the clinical frontline, reducing the burden on patients and increasing the substitution rate of generic drugs. Hundreds of millions of patients have access to high-quality and affordable drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are also some medical staff and patients who still lack confidence in the clinical efficacy and safety of generic drugs, especially whether the quality of the selected generic drugs can be guaranteed after the price reduction. There are concerns, and some people have suggested that consistency evaluation does not equal clinical equivalence.&quot; On the morning of October 17, 2023, Zhang Lan, Director of the Pharmacy Department of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University (hereinafter referred to as Xuanwu Hospital), spoke at a press conference of the National Medical Insurance Administration Said above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to truly and comprehensively understand the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs selected through centralized procurement, starting from 2021, the National Medical Insurance Administration will organize Xuanwu Hospital and other medical institutions to target the second , conducted real-world research on the clinical efficacy and safety of three batches of generic drugs selected for national mass procurement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Previously, Xuanwu Hospital and more than 20 medical institutions in Beijing conducted real-world research on the 14 selected drugs in the first batch of centralized procurement, and the results showed that the selected drugs There is no statistical difference in clinical effectiveness and safety between generic drugs and original drugs (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report on November 7, 2021 &quot;&lt; a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/217325&quot;>;100 million people benefited, and the three-year medical insurance negotiation burden was reduced by nearly 170 billion yuan&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Lan is the leader of the research team for this 140,000 real case study. It is reported that the research and evaluation targets 23 varieties in six major therapeutic areas including anti-infection, anti-tumor, metabolism and endocrinology, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, neuropsychiatric, and digestive systems, including selected generic drugs from 38 brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Lan revealed that in the future, we will continue to conduct real-world evaluations of subsequent batches of selected generic drugs to provide evidence-based support for clinical use. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Real-world research reflects the actual diagnosis and treatment process and changes in patients&#39; health conditions under real conditions. More objectively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medication in real environments.&quot; Bian Xiaolan, Director of the Pharmacy Department of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The results of this study show that five oral anti-infective drugs, including cefdinir, cefaclor, azithromycin, linezolid and moxifloxacin, are similar to There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between pharmaceutical and original drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the anti-tumor drugs, five generic drugs: Tegio, azacitidine, abiraterone, letrozole, and anastrozole, are comparable to the original drugs The clinical efficacy and safety are equivalent. The therapeutic response rate of generic capecitabine is higher than that of the original drug (50% vs 30%), and the difference is statistically significant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the drugs for metabolic diseases, metformin (hypoglycemic drug), vildagliptin (hypoglycemic drug), and febuxostat (uric acid-lowering drug) are the best choices There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between generic drugs and original drugs. There are 4 brands of generic drugs of glimepiride (hypoglycemic drugs) participating in the evaluation. Among them, the efficacy and safety of 3 brands of generic drugs are equivalent to the original drugs. Another brand of generic drugs is not only safe. It is equivalent to the original drug, and in the evaluation index of hypoglycemic effect, the compliance rate of glycosylated hemoglobin &lt;7% is higher than that of the original drug (61.7% vs 42%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A total of 3 types of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular drugs were included in the evaluation, including 2 anticoagulants (apixaban, ticagrelor) and 1 antihypertensive drug medicine (valsartan). The results showed that there was no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between the generic drugs of the above three drugs and the original drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also 2 psychotropic drugs and 1 digestive system treatment drug. There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between the generic drug group and the original drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The target population of real-world evaluation is patients who actually use clinical drugs. The sample size can reach hundreds to tens of thousands. The research indicators are direct efficacy and safety. Clinical indicators, study duration, long-term follow-up of subjects as needed. Compared with real-world studies, drug consistency evaluation focuses on verifying the equivalence of generic drugs to original drugs in terms of design, biological absorption and metabolism, and the target population is healthy subjects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Research indicators mainly include pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence. Only when pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence are met can generic drugs Through consistency evaluation.&quot; Bian Xiaolan explained. Pharmaceutical equivalence requires that generic drugs have the same active ingredients, effective dosage, route of administration, dosage form, etc. as the original drug, and must meet drug quality standards. Bioequivalence requires that the absorption and metabolism of generic drug preparations in the body are consistent with those of the original drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We conduct real-world research to further verify and support the efficacy of drugs through different scenarios and methods. It is a process in which real-world data generates real-world evidence. It’s not that the quality and efficacy consistency evaluation work standards are not high.” Bian Xiaolan emphasized that through real-world research, the research team has verified the efficacy and safety of the drugs selected through centralized procurement through the generic drug consistency evaluation from actual diagnosis and treatment scenarios. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Six drugs have been notified of centralized procurement in the past five years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Passing the consistency evaluation is not a &quot;talisman&quot; or &quot;pass&quot; for drug quality. After a drug passes the consistency evaluation, the regulatory authorities will still conduct full-chain quality supervision on the production, circulation, and use of the drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Drug supervision is not only the supervision of results, but also the supervision of the process. For example, the regulatory authorities require: ensure that the production process is consistent with the approved process, and ensure that each batch of sales The quality of sub-standard drugs is consistent with the declared samples to ensure continuous research on marketed drugs and timely reporting of adverse reactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For example, in the production process, from the selection of raw materials to the production process, there is a complete quality control and supervision system, even if it is only the supplier of pharmaceutical raw materials. Replacements need to be reported to the drug regulatory department to ensure the stability of drug quality.&quot; Zhang Lan gave an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the national drug administration and medical insurance departments have established a quality supervision coordination mechanism for the selected products, and implemented full-coverage supervision and inspection of the selected companies. The State Food and Drug Administration deploys special supervision work every year to achieve &quot;three full coverages&quot; of enterprise supervision and inspection of selected products through national centralized procurement, product sampling inspection, and adverse drug reaction monitoring. Currently, inspections involve nearly 600 drug manufacturers, covering all 333 selected drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;八批国家组织集采共有1387个中选产品，5年来累计有6个产品被药监部门通报存在质量风险，其中2个国产仿制药、4个进口药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“对以上出现存在质量风险的中选产品，医保部门联动药监部门开展处置，采取取消中选资格、纳入&#39;违规名单&#39;，限制涉事企业在一定时间内参加国家组织集采。对于出现质量风险的产品，不论内资、外资企业，医保部门会同药监部门坚决处理、一视同仁，持续释放质量问题&#39;零容忍&#39;的信号。” 国家医保局价格招采专家组组长章明介绍。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2023年10月14日徐京坤把船开往“咖啡路”赛事村的时候，我正在家里收拾衣柜，北方已经入秋，下周据说有雨气温更低。普通人的日子就是这样，三餐四季，周而复始。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年是“咖啡路”双人不间断跨大西洋帆船赛30周年，第一次增加了单人返程赛。徐京坤将先和搭档、英国船长麦克·戈丁从法国出发，绕行非洲西侧、南美洲东北侧绕标点，到达中美洲，此后再单人返航欧洲。一个多月的时间里两次穿越赤道无风区，航行一万多海里（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;近两万公里&lt;/span>;）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看徐京坤在海上发的视频，法国那边也很冷了，他在船上也穿上了厚厚的防风外套。想起采访中他不止一次地吐槽“法国的海水真冷”、“大西洋的水可太冷了！”我不由自主笑了起来，冷暖相通，但英雄与我们普通人毕竟大不相同，我忙着找毛衣秋裤，他却可以战胜身体的限制，投身风浪，穿越季节。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月份在青岛见他的时候，他前一天刚从法国飞回来，我问他有没有时差反应，他说没有，“身体已经习惯了！”常年远洋航海让他习惯的不止是时差，还有季节变更。2024年他将要参加世界上最难的“旺代环球”航海竞赛，航线上将经历9次冬夏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年秋天，徐京坤决定买一条imoca60超级赛船参加2024年旺代单人不间断环球帆船赛。四年一届的旺代单人环球（Vendée Globe）是竞技航海的“珠穆朗玛峰”，要想赢得2024旺代环球的入场券，他必须先参加指定的资格赛。2022赛季他完成了“朗姆路”单人跨大西洋帆船赛，拿到旺代环球资格赛的宝贵积分，并成为2024第10届旺代环球的首批官方候选人之一。此次“咖啡路”和其后的单人返航赛如果能够顺利完赛，徐京坤有望抓牢2024旺代环球的入场券。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐京坤12岁时因为一场意外被截去了左小臂，“独臂船长”是他的一个标签，他一只手掌握帆船，完成了环中国海、单人小船跨大西洋，以及环球航行等壮举。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年徐京坤开始参与职业赛船竞技，这个领域里没有对伤残人士的优待，所有参与者都是航海竞技的“能力者”——2020“旺代环球”中获得第七名的船长达米安·塞甘穿着海盗服完赛，他高举的左手是一支海盗铁钩。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从见到徐京坤第一眼，他的自如和舒展就让我忘了他的残臂是个问题。他说航海彻底改变了自己，将自己变成一个越来越自在自如的人，我想真正医治他的是自己的“完全”，他已经完全胜过了意外事件带来的身心伤害，他的左手虽有残缺，但常年的训练赋予并激发了他超强的身体能力，让他胜任工作、掌控生活、达成目标，稳行在水面之上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐京坤要花两天的时间才能把赛船从所在港口开到法国名港勒阿弗尔，从10月20日开始，勒阿弗尔“咖啡路”双人跨大西洋赛事村将向公众开放，29日赛船陆续启航，开始2023年的跨大西洋竞速航行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;离岸航行是一项神奇的运动，一方面赛队和船长们要顶住预算和速度的压力疾驰，另一方面即便是最快的跨大西洋纪录也要七八天，环球航行则长达数月，水手们在深海里总会有一种天地悠长、日月无边的孤寂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我写这个小文章的时候，徐京坤刚刚发布了一条朋友圈，他还在去勒阿弗尔的路上，他用无人机的鱼眼摄像机拍下自己和赛船，“哈哈，这是我在海上唯一的玩具了！”他的太太阿九给他留言，催他不要贪玩，“你再不到，咖啡路都启航了！”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;在轻松筹募捐之外，涉事楼盘的业主李萍（化名）告诉南方周末记者，17日下午开始，小区卖菜的微信群内，就有居民自发捐款和统计，并把捐款统一转交给女童母亲邓女士，“每人一两百元”。后来，有人在群里问捐款的去处和用途，但邓女士在群里除了转发轻松筹求助链接、抖音视频、致谢回复之外，没有正面回应询问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月20日下午，华西医院宣传部工作人员告诉南方周末记者，患儿目前还在重症监护室，由多学科的专家对其进行治疗，病情“较入院的时候要平稳一些”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当单次求助金额超过50万元时，轻松筹规定“应提交具有相关资质的医疗机构书面证明”。但上述医院人员表示，医院“没有出具任何相关的费用证明”，16日23时许女童转到该院，截至20日8时，患儿通过人工窗口预交费用共11万元，已经发生的费用在3万元左右，目前没有欠费。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者多次联系女童母亲和案件代理律师周兆成，截至发稿，并未得到对方回复。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;同单元的另一位妈妈罗霞（化名）记得，她所在的小区群在收到邓女士发的轻松筹募捐链接前，已经有邻居自发在群里捐钱，大家的捐款数额不一，由群主转交，很多人都捐了。罗霞看见有人捐了500元，她捐了不到100元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李萍提供的聊天记录显示，前述卖菜群给涵涵的捐款有三笔，分别是3566元、266元、1416元。10月17日，前两笔被接收后，邓女士回复“谢谢您们”。李萍说，这些天来，一些不在群里的居民也想拜托她们转交捐款，还有一些私下要了邓女士微信，想给她捐款。“都是当父母的，看不得孩子受罪。”李萍解释自己捐钱的原因。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;罗霞则是想着赔偿不会很快到位，邻里间先给涵涵一家筹点钱应急，“像我们平民百姓，买套房子也不容易，还背有房贷，能有好多钱呢？”事后，她询问群主一共筹了多少钱，群主没告诉她具体金额，罗霞估算，如果给到对方，“可能有两三万吧”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于轻松筹捐款，10月20日，代理律师周兆成在接受媒体采访时表示，夫妻俩衣着朴素，没有穿戴名牌衣物或首饰，居住环境普通。两人目前未工作，全心全意在医院陪护女儿，暂时没有经济来源。虽然维权后续会陆续启动，但就孩子的治疗而言，赔付款“显然太慢了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当天，南方周末记者以业主身份询问了该楼栋的管家，对方表示，女童治疗费目前由物业垫付，“毕竟在小区里发生的事，该有的责任我们不会推脱的”。该管家称不知晓垫付具体金额，南方周末记者从轻松筹了解到，目前物业方的垫付金额在10万元左右。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“家属自己预估金额”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;截至10月20日，涵涵家人在轻松筹互助链接中，上传了华西医院的预收款凭据、病情证明书等。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这位公关人员还表示，如果孩子在后续治疗里用到这笔近200万元的捐款，平台将根据涵涵的治疗情况，审核医院的小票、检测单据后，“每个阶段做一次结算，我们再把这个款项打到医院”。他称，可以保证的是，“这个钱肯定到不了家属手里”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果有捐钱用户希望退款，轻松筹也有相应的通道。捐款人提出申请并提供相关证明后，此前款项可以原路返回。轻松筹表示，如果最终花费款项不到200万元，可以把款项捐给其他公益基金会。至于捐给哪家公益基金会、要帮助哪些群体，将由家属决定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位2021年离开轻松筹的前工作人员向南方周末记者分析，筹款平台也会希望通过社会公共事件，得到更高的知名度和更好的口碑，但涵涵的筹款链接和筹款速度“确实太快了”：“我们以前帮助过的人，花一百多万也有很多，但被狗咬伤的案例，还是第一次碰到这么严重的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[柳大华实名举报棋协领导：有无操纵比赛胜负与奖金分配应彻查丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259037]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;2023年10月17日晚，棋手柳大华在个人社交媒体发布视频，实名“举报”国家体育总局棋牌运动管理中心副主任郭莉萍，引发舆论关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;柳大华指控郭莉萍说，“长期以来，她包庇纵容象棋界黑恶势力，公然使用电脑软件以及现代科技手段操纵、包办国内各种大型比赛的胜负与奖金分配。” 并称郭莉萍“对这一惊天丑闻不查不问，反而对挺身揭露丑闻的运动员、教练员进行百般打压、打击报复”，要求“彻查并严肃处理，还中国象棋界一个晴朗公正的天际”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月18日，棋牌运动管理中心工作人员表示，已获悉此事并向领导反馈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;柳大华在“举报”中没有出示任何证据。 “长期以来”是多久？ “象棋界黑恶势力”指哪些人？ “惊天丑闻”指的是哪一桩？郭莉萍又包庇纵容、打击报复了谁？ “操纵比赛胜负、包办奖金分配”又是哪些比赛？因此，柳大华应提交更具体的证据来支撑指控，不然“败类”之类的说法就是纯粹人身攻击，指控涉嫌污蔑诽谤，也应承担相应的法律责任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而关于“使用电脑软件以及现代科技手段操纵比赛”，算是柳大华举报视频里的重点，外界也据此联想，此次举报或与今年象棋界的“录音门”事件有关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自从1997年卡斯帕罗夫败给“深蓝”以来，各项棋类运动都必须直面电脑软件与人工智能的挑战。相较于深度学习AI才能攻略的围棋，中国象棋在本世纪初的PC时代就已被电脑CPU攻克。 “下不过电脑”在中国象棋界并不是什么议题，“软件作弊”才是讨论多年的话题。一旦棋手使用电脑软件，那么几乎没有人可以下得过“人机结合”的对手。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;柳大华提到的以科技手段操纵比赛胜负、包办奖金分配，在技术上是完全可以做到的。如果说在过去操纵比赛还要疏通打点的话，今天想要内定胜负只需要使用科技手段，比如藏着智能通讯设备进入赛场，实时与后台“人机结合”，自然战无不胜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多年以来，中国象棋界棋手彼此指控“软件作弊”已经成风，甚至于不少新锐棋手仅仅是胜率过高就会被人怀疑用软件作弊，乃至发展到了相互猜忌、人人自危的地步。棋手王天一就屡屡遭遇类似指控，甚至在一次比赛中遭遇了对手郑惟桐的“带屏蔽器示威”。因此，柳大华举报视频一出，不少象棋爱好者都认为，此事就是三个月前“录音门”事件的后续。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“录音门”事件发生于2023年7月中旬，录音内容主要是象棋棋手王跃飞与郝继超的对话，其中两人以黑话提到“买棋卖棋”，还暗示棋手王天一“仪器作弊”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事件发酵之后，棋手党斐在网上表态，拿出“要求彻查”的态度，在社媒上一直“内涵”王天一。其间还经历了“党斐发律师函”“王天一直播回击”的桥段，事件至今莫衷一是。党斐是柳大华的入室弟子，10月18日他也发布了实名举报视频，表示自己有九十分钟的录音，已将证据转交相关部门。可见“录音门”余波荡漾，此次“师徒举报”又使争议升级。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“录音门”发酵三个月来，从录音门里的“仪器作弊”“买棋卖棋”，再到柳大华此次指控的“电脑软件操纵比赛，包办比赛胜负与奖金分配”，这些指控究竟是否成立，抑或是诬告，理应由体育总局纪委监察部门乃至公安机关予以调查，而不是停留在舆论战里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而此次举报事件也足以令人反思，中国象棋这门古老运动在当下的自身定位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早在2005年，“赵鑫鑫买棋事件”就让“买棋卖棋”成为笼罩在中国象棋界上空的阴影。 “录音门”在今年也不是第一桩，“棋手赵国荣向学员收钱，带人打团体赛混大师头衔”的音视频证据也在8月份闹到了网上，至今尚未有调查结论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次柳大华举报中提及的“电脑软件”也不禁让人反思，鉴于“买卖胜负受贿谋利”在信息时代变得更简单了，那么胜负的价值与比赛的意义何在？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;既然中国象棋的全局最优解法已被电脑算力攻克（就像魔方的解法早被人脑算力攻克一样），那还不如逐步演化为一项民间自发开展的智力娱乐活动，由民间机构组织比赛，自负盈亏，自订规则，而不是沦为今天的“人机结合游戏”，靡费公共资金的同时伤害棋迷热情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国象棋发展到今天，如果真的要从“中华民族文化瑰宝”沦为“买卖胜负受贿谋利”的工具，那么凶手是谁？相关部门理应深入调查此事，同时思考棋牌运动管理的改革之道。 &lt;/p>;

Nowadays, it has become an internet celebrity check-in place for many tourists coming to Nanjing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We saw someone sharing this place on social platforms, so we came over to take a look during the weekend.&quot; Nanjing citizen Ms. Xia told reporters that she was attracted to What I came here to check in with my best friend was this street sign on the viewing platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, not only Nanjing, but also in trendy neighborhoods or scenic areas in many cities, there are such Internet celebrity street signs, and they continue to attract all kinds of people to stop and take photos. In addition to being used by scenic spots, cultural and creative parks, etc. to attract visitors, these street signs are also used by some merchants with keen business sense to regard them as traffic tools to attract the public to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In front of a bakery near the intersection of Zhaolin Street and Shitou Road Street in Daoli District, Harbin, there is a street sign saying &quot;I miss you very much in Harbin&quot;. It also caused many passers-by to stop and take photos. Others, such as some milk tea shops, coffee shops, snack shops, etc., have also erected various street signs to attract people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, some famous landmarks and road signs are also sought after. For example, the Drum Tower street sign in Beijing has become one of the most popular street signs at the moment. In order to hit the Gulou street sign, some young people will even take a hard seat on the train for more than ten hours and then wait in line for two hours to complete the photo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The popularity of street signs has also become a kind of social currency. So far, the topic &quot;The whole Internet calls for missing you street signs&quot; has been viewed nearly 5 million times on the social platform Xiaohongshu, and has been played more than 670 million times on the short video platform Douyin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Judging from some social platforms, young people are not only keen to show off their various &quot;Miss You&quot; series of street signs, but also some anti-bone street signs such as &quot;I endure in Chongqing.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve been around for a long time&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m eating in Xi&#39;an and waiting to die&quot; are also popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ms. Fan, who runs a metal materials factory in Shanghai, said that she started the road sign customization business in 2020. But what I never expected was that the mediocre street signs in the past two years could actually sell out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The order volume is increasing year by year, and thousands of street signs are sold a year.&quot; Ms. Fan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/SF9uH2Zy2Ig5WCt2ZAAisKTrSHIkkRumTZtQoyWQ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/SF9uH2Zy2Ig5WCt2ZAAisKTrSHIkkRumTZtQoyWQ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254424&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Why do young people like to take pictures of street signs? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why young people like to take pictures of street signs actually has both environmental and historical origins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First of all, after the epidemic dissipated, various places ushered in a small rebound in travel, and people began to go to major cities and scenic spots to take photos. In addition, City walks have emerged in various places, and young people have started walking in the city, taking photos while walking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These trips naturally bring traffic to scenic spots, Internet celebrity spots, streets and alleys, and this traffic is reflected on social platforms, that is, many people take photos of street signs. In other ways, the check-in goal of &quot;I have been here before&quot; was completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From a historical perspective, street signs are essentially one of the forms of plaques. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of cultural origins, plaques are an indispensable decoration in Chinese classical architecture. Whether it is a building, a platform, a pavilion, a pavilion, a pavilion, a pavilion, a hall, or a pavilion, plaques are in harmony with the building. They are an essential part of the building and are equivalent to the eyes of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taking a plaque and showing the inscription on the plaque is the fastest way to convey that you have visited this place or like this place. In front of many historic sites, towers or mountain peaks, whether it is a stone tablet, a foyer plaque or a poem written in calligraphy, the public likes to take photos. This in itself is a self-evident awareness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although today&#39;s street signs have changed in form and text compared to inscriptions, they actually have the same expression effect and can achieve a &quot; The functions of &quot;I checked in here&quot; and &quot;Say this sentence for me&quot; are a modern &quot;mouth substitute&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Moreover, compared with the rigidity of plaques on ancient buildings, today’s street signs can be humorous and can also be customized with various golden sentences, making them more personalized and youthful in expression. , can better interact with the mood of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HhTRsdQmapKYKUNw4xVmj1bOhwm7cdeOQKEFiyqy.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HhTRsdQmapKYKUNw4xVmj1bOhwm7cdeOQKEFiyqy.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254425&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Are street signs so popular that they annoy people? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the large-scale imitation and transplantation of similar street signs in various places has also brought criticism to the popular street signs. Recently, the street signs installed by Zhejiang University, Central Academy of Fine Arts and other universities have been criticized by some freshmen. Some people said directly: &quot;I don&#39;t even want to take a look at the Internet celebrity aura that comes to my face.&quot; Others said euphemistically: &quot;It feels a bit out of class.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Moreover, as the number of Internet celebrity street signs continues to increase, the installation of street signs in some areas also has the problem of illegal construction. Since July this year, Shanghai, Ningbo, Shiyan, Leshan and other places have removed such illegal &quot;Internet celebrity street signs&quot; placed on the roadside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Relevant staff from the Zoning and Place Names Office of Ningbo Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau of Zhejiang Province explained, &quot;Road name plates are a type of place name signs, which are national legal landmarks. It is also a kind of public facility and should be set up by the civil affairs department.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Captain He of the Comprehensive Law Enforcement Squadron of the Pujiang County Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province said, &quot;These The size and shape are actually relatively close to, or basically the same as, the standard place name signs set up by the government’s civil affairs department. The Internet celebrity street signs we manage are mainly for those set up along the street, and are actually a type of place name sign. &lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It can be seen that if you just follow the trend without thinking and set up some Internet celebrity street signs in places such as universities and libraries, some of the styles do not match, and it may be wrong. Causing disgust. Secondly, if the road signs are installed by merchants themselves and named randomly, it is easy to mislead people to go the wrong way or find the wrong place, causing people to lose time and money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this regard, Professor Gu, associate professor at Southeast University School of Law and public member of the Nanjing Urban Governance Committee, analyzed, “Internet celebrity street signs that hinder public order require relevant departments to promptly Intervention and regulation. However, it is also the goal of urban management to explore more and better cultural and creative solutions and Internet celebrity designs that can attract traffic and bring economic benefits while taking into account social responsibilities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In general, street signs that extend the traffic function can be viewed dialectically from multiple angles and optimize strategies. The presentation of street signs must, on the one hand, ensure the identification function of public facilities, and on the other hand, provide appropriate space for the presentation of &quot;Internet celebrity street signs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While diverting traffic without interfering with public travel, this may be the development direction of characteristic road signs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[硬核军训是怎么炼成的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258988]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh57DFsDOpHt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh 57DFsDOpHt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangxi Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology 2023 freshmen military training demonstration&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Special Warfare Mode&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The alarm sounded, orange-red and white smoke staggered and dispersed, and the air was filled with sulfur smell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than forty students wearing camouflage uniforms and holding model Type 95 rifles approached in batches from one side of the green field to the other. There are scattered fire rings made of cardboard boxes and obstacles covered with camouflage nets along the way. The advancers either suddenly fell down or rolled out of their guns to avoid the explosions flying from the opposite side. Every time he stopped neatly, he was still in the shooting posture, with the muzzle of the gun pointed at the &quot;enemy camp&quot; ahead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this military training exercise, students acted as a special operations force of our country. Their mission at the moment is to board a strange border island to rescue the hostages held by terrorists. More than 20 people, including &quot;hostages&quot; and &quot;robbers,&quot; were stationed under a camouflage awning on the other side of the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While advancing, we encountered stubborn resistance from the enemy. Many special forces &quot;fell&quot; and 7 &quot;sacrificed&quot;. Medical soldiers wearing white armbands rushed into the smoke-filled battlefield in groups of four. The two in front held guns for cover, and the two behind carried the wounded onto stretchers for treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The robbers were equipped with more heavy firearms: a mortar and two rocket launchers. We only have one rocket launcher. When the battle was lost, the special forces issued a request for support. Subsequently, simulated armored vehicles and tanks manufactured at a 1:1 ratio were driven onto the playground one after another. With the support of solid barriers and mobile turrets, the special forces team successfully reached the enemy camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rescue soldiers and tanks have surrounded the enemy camp layer by layer, but the robbers are still guarding the &quot;door&quot;. Our demolitions use directional blasts to blow up the stronghold. There was a loud noise and white light shot out. The hostages were finally rescued after rescue soldiers rushed in and engaged in close combat with the robbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the military training meeting of Guilin Institute of Aerospace Industry (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guihang&quot;&lt;/span>;) on September 27 The finale of the parade ceremony: the performance of the special warfare phalanx. Long after the performance ended, the applause and cheers of more than 5,000 freshmen in military training echoed throughout the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The flame of excitement burned in Instructor Zhang. As the instructor of the special operations phalanx and the planner of the special operations performance, he also participated in the &quot;rescue operation&quot; and played the role of a special forces commander. Instructor Zhang’s skin was dark, his face was covered with sweat, and the gray and green colors of his camouflage makeup blurred together. He spoke breathlessly and in an uplifting tone. When he asked questions to the team members who were resting on the floor, he always received resounding answers and hearty laughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instructor Zhang is a militia member of the Guilin Garrison Area. After retiring from the armed police, he worked as a special warfare training instructor at a military training summer camp in Guangdong for four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from conventional military training, special warfare training imitates the training of our country&#39;s special forces, selecting the most elite &quot;soldiers&quot; and adding subjects such as tactical movements, weapon operation, and wilderness survival. It is more intense and difficult. Instructor Zhang firmly believes that &quot;this kind of education method can truly temper students&#39; bodies and spirits.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The educational concept of &quot;barbaring one&#39;s body&quot; is sometimes accompanied by more voices of incomprehension. Once upon a time, there was a young man who came from Zhejiang for training, and he always practiced gun-holding movements perfunctorily. In order to urge him, Instructor Zhang couldn&#39;t help but said some harsh words: &quot;If you can&#39;t hold a gun well, then you don&#39;t need to eat.&quot; As a result, his parents scolded him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m not denying him food, I just want him to experience setbacks and growth. Training is not the purpose. The important thing is to let students learn the valuable qualities of self-improvement, self-reliance, and self-confidence.&quot; Instructor Zhang remembered that when he first joined the army At that time, because I was not holding the gun properly, I was ordered to do the same thing by the squad leader for a whole morning. After that, he practiced diligently and became a model in the army&#39;s tactical training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Guihang, Instructor Zhang rarely has the trouble of not being understood - the special team members are tougher than he imagined. Among Guihang&#39;s 5,000 freshmen participating in the training, more than 80 students from various military training camps passed the selection of height and physical fitness, and finally completed the study and performance of tactics, shooting and other projects. Even if you wear protective gear, rolling, climbing and other actions will inevitably cause arm and leg abrasions. But most people are enthusiastic. Instructor Zhang recalled that a classmate from the Sixth Battalion of the special operations team had a serious muscle strain. After a day of rest, his symptoms improved and he immediately returned to the team for training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real battlefield will not leave opportunities to lax soldiers. All the training of the special operations team are highly simulated battlefields. The human ladder construction training is to restore the scene of three people fighting together. Gun training simulates a quick response to an enemy attack. &quot;The simulated gun is relatively heavy, and the students are naughty and occasionally deliberately distort the movement of the gun.&quot; Instructor Zhang will seriously teach him: &quot;When encountering a real attack, the gun must be drawn within 1 second or even 0.1 seconds. The movements must be crisp and clear, and the eyes must be clean.&quot; You have to be keen, otherwise you will be a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About 10% of the people who initially signed up to join the special forces team dropped out. &quot;Special warfare training requires very high physical fitness.

Instructor Zhang does not encourage such people to stay because &quot;they are not interested in the special training itself. They just want to take pictures with tanks and armored vehicles. They cannot accept the hard training and cannot keep up with the pace.&quot; In his opinion, only the students themselves are active With participation and cooperation, hard-core training and realistic performances will not be in name only. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/csZ7etnCAfokT74q9Qot5lJZJSRMp9TKLcAYgcqG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/csZ7etnCAfokT74q9Qot5lJZJSRMp9TKLcAYgcqG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Special warfare phalanx display during Guihang military training exhibition&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;National Defense Enthusiasts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As night falls, the mountains surrounding the campus gradually disappear, the singing of the Mid-Autumn Festival Gala rehearsal is endless, and the lake is full of students running around it. It’s an ordinary Tuesday night at the Huajiang Campus of Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidian&quot;&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the lively playground and stage, in the quiet square, more than 20 members of the Patriotic National Defense Education Association are conducting their daily training. This is a club composed of enthusiasts of national defense knowledge and military training in Guidian. They often participate in the school&#39;s national defense education activities and usually maintain at least two hours of tactical training a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to wearing camouflage uniforms, the team members also wore simulated guns, tactical helmets, marching bags, protective gear, and military boots, just like troops going out to perform missions. They are all students participating in this year&#39;s military training for freshmen. At this time, two weeks have passed since the end of the Guidian military training camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment in 2019, the Patriotic National Defense Education Association has selected students who are determined to participate in tactical training for a long time from each new military training class and regularly conducted daily training on infantry combat skills. The core personnel who have undergone long-term training will assist the instructors in completing the tactical training for new students in the second year of military training. In the 2023 Guidian freshmen military training, 150 students from the tactical company were assigned to provide guidance to 30 members of the 21st and 22nd level associations. The person in charge pointed out that this kind of small class teaching can improve the efficiency of training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the participants in the association have the idea of ​​joining the military or the police. Lin Yu, who served as the gunner of the anti-tank team in this military training, applied for the police academy as her first choice in the college entrance examination. Joining the tactical team satisfied her childhood desire to operate firearms. Shen Hong serves as an industrial infantryman responsible for demining. His father was a soldier. Shen Hong&#39;s favorite TV drama character is Li Yunlong. He believes that this tactical training has given him a lot of knowledge and strengthened his ambition to join the army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fend off the enemy from the front.&quot; As the squad leader issued the order, the members of the seven-person platoon quickly completed squatting, turning over, and crawling from the stance of marching with guns, with their guns pointing forward. After hearing &quot;defend the enemy from the rear&quot;, the members who were running forward suddenly turned around, slid sideways and lay down, with their guns pointed at the rear. This is an individual soldier action exercise, the association’s most basic training program. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Yilong, chairman and founder of the association and a preparatory class for the children of border guards in 2019, is supervising the training of members. He reminded the squad leader to take the members to a venue without glass ballast to prevent scratches caused by the huge friction with the ground. When Lin Yu fulfilled the command to &quot;lie down while running&quot;, his movements were not coherent enough. Huang Yilonglue jokingly urged the squad leader to correct Lin Yu&#39;s actions. He explained to a reporter from Southern People Weekly, &quot;She slowed down first and then lay down. It was too slow. Now she is dead in the actual combat state. You can see that other people slid down directly from the high speed. She almost slowed down.&quot; If I go on to 0, I will still be afraid.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about the essentials and operational significance of various military actions, Huang Yilong always speaks very fast. He can talk about the &quot;three-point running and shooting position change&quot; in team operations and the obstacle breaking training of the engineering chemical defense team like an encyclopedia. Huang Yilong grew up in a military compound and liked to study various military tactics on his own. He started participating in military clubs in high school. This hobby continued into college and became an ambition. &quot;After graduation, I will either join the army or plunge into research in the military field. I will not be so comfortable doing other jobs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan for the 2023 Guidian military training and the tactical confrontation performance of the red and blue squares is Huang Yilong and the leaders of the training units jointly completed the planning. &quot;Our first tactical display in 2021 will be more conservative, with only infantry and pure attackers. This year, with armored vehicles, blasting tubes and other equipment, we can display more complex tactics, and we have designed offensive and defensive confrontation, engineer barbed wire breaking obstacles and other links.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Huang Yilong, the military training exercises in Guihang, a ten-minute drive from Guidian, also made reference to this tactical confrontation model. &quot;Guihang&#39;s Military Enthusiasts Association is a fraternal association with us and shares some promotional materials and equipment resources. At the beginning of their association&#39;s establishment, we helped them organize some training. This year, we also seconded guns to Guihang&#39;s freshmen military training. Give it to them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the next step in the development of the association, Huang Yilong hopes to form a mutual aid community with more military hobby societies in local universities to exchange more experiences in tactical training. In addition, he plans to enrich tactical training projects. &quot;In the beginning we only had simple training on advancing, kneeling and sliding, and fending off enemies. Later we went up the mountain and carried out infiltration and counter-infiltration operations in the forest. There may be new development directions in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/VpLyIkjRdB9o98kmFtnycQIKGic5OP5m1r3hIaR3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/VpLyIkjRdB9o98kmFtnycQIKGic5OP5m1r3hIaR3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254442&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guidian Patriotic National Defense Education Association conducts woodland infiltration and counter-infiltration training near the school&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;Resources and Culture&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It takes about 50 minutes to drive from Guilin North Railway Station in the direction of Yaoshan Scenic Area to reach Guihang and Guidian. They are only one stop apart on the route of bus number 13. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both schools are surrounded by mountains, covering vast areas, far away from the bustling city, and seem to be specially designed for Qing Dynasty. Unless it is a holiday, there are few vehicles passing by on the mountain roads surrounding the school. In the nearby Yaoshan Scenic Area, there are dense forests and gentle slopes. The surrounding environment provides the school with a suitable place for field training and simulated jungle combat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guihang chose Yaoshan for training. The person in charge of the school&#39;s armed forces department explained, &quot;With more than 5,000 people training, safety is the first priority. In addition, we must also meet everyone&#39;s needs for exercise, so we walked to the mountains where there are few cars.&quot; The members of the special operations team used trees and grass to For cover, they wore gas masks and simulated woodland infiltration, jungle manhunts and other activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The supply of military training equipment benefits from cooperation between universities and between universities and military institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guidian’s imitation armored vehicles and rocket launchers are all seconded from Guilin Military Expo Park. Staff of the Military Expo Park revealed that Guidian’s national flag guard team will also come to the Military Expo Park to perform. The simulated guns and gas masks were loaned from the Army Special Warfare College. You Jiangjiao, chief of the Comprehensive Section of the Guidian Armed Forces Department, said that over three days, nearly 10,000 military training students took turns to experience shooting simulated guns. Guidian, the current deputy minister of the Armed Forces, once worked at the Army Special Warfare Academy. In order for the performance to go smoothly, he took the initiative to help the students borrow 55 marching bags from a unit in Qifeng Town. Some of the simulated mortars, tanks, firearms and other equipment used in Guihang&#39;s military training are provided by the school&#39;s military associations, and some are seconded from the Guilin Garrison District. Guidian, Guilin and other universities will also lend some equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, real gun and live ammunition shooting in military training in colleges and universities has gradually been replaced by simulated gun shooting. You Jiangjiao pointed out, &quot;Shooting with real guns is too dangerous. The real guns borrowed by the school are mainly disassembled for students to learn.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teachers from the armed forces departments of the two schools believe that the school&#39;s emphasis on military training Investing more resources will help enhance students’ national defense awareness and promote military recruitment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As part of national defense education, military training is also a window for ordinary students to understand the life of the army. The person in charge of the Guihang Armed Forces Department once conducted a post-training survey on the students of the school. He found that the previous military training, which had a single form and lacked equipment support, made many students question the meaning of military training: &quot;If the military training showed students all about going forward and standing in military postures, they would also find military life boring like this. It is difficult to yearn for the army. Military training adds activities such as tactical training and enriches the form to more comprehensively reflect the real life in the military camp and allow students to understand the specific needs of national defense. This can inspire their enthusiasm and belief in joining the army.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Li Ming, a retired soldier from the Guilin Garrison District, has a military dream that was cultivated by the military training experience he witnessed in his childhood. His parents are teachers at Guilin Forestry School. Since elementary school, Li Ming has often observed the military training of this technical secondary school after school. At that time, the use of firearms accounted for a large proportion of military training courses, and Li Ming, who was watching from the sidelines, was always clamoring to play with firearms. When Li Ming was in junior high school, instructor Chen often came to this school to train students. He often played with Li Ming, who was unwilling to do homework, and taught him a lot of military knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day, Instructor Chen accidentally broke his arm while demonstrating a certain movement. Other instructors quickly rushed forward to check the wound and sent Instructor Chen to the infirmary. This scene deeply inspired Li Ming: &quot;I am an only child born in the 1990s. I can only cry alone when I am injured. When the instructor is injured, his comrades are a solid backing. We study with peace of mind, and the soldiers are also our backing, protecting everyone and the children. The safety of my home.&quot; Li Ming determined to be a soldier who can become the backing of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, he is also an instructor at Guihang Military Training. He hopes that the seeds that instructor Chen once planted in his heart will also be planted in the hearts of Guihang students. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Is hard-core military training suitable for more people?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The resources of the special operations training model cannot benefit everyone who participates in military training. Among the more than 5,000 freshmen participating in the training at Guihang, except for more than 80 members of the special operations team, other students rarely have the opportunity to come into contact with simulated firearms. Courses on square formations such as split formation and prisoner boxing are still based on formation training. For safety reasons, those who drive armored vehicles and tanks are instructors who have obtained driver&#39;s licenses. Students can only take photos with these models or sit on them to experience them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A classmate of the split company felt a little regretful that he did not have the courage to sign up for the special operations company: &quot;Although it is more difficult, I can also learn a lot of military skills and experience more military life. It&#39;s a pity that I I wear glasses. During the selection, the instructor said that the movements may break the glasses, and those wearing glasses cannot participate. In addition, there are height requirements, and those with martial arts and dance foundations are given priority. I don’t seem to be good enough.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Wang Zhipeng, a lecturer in the Military Teaching and Research Office of Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University, said that the emergence of special training models in military training is to meet the military training needs of different types of students: &quot;In recent years, colleges and universities have expanded their enrollment, and the number of participants has continued to increase. The physical fitness and adaptability of students have There are differences, and some high-intensity training may not be suitable for all students. Similar activities are also held in the national student military training camps organized by the Ministry of Education and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Central Military Commission to provide students with good physical fitness and deep national defense sentiments. A platform for growth, experience and advancement.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the threshold of student quality, special warfare training itself also has higher requirements for resources such as venues and equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest headache for instructor Zhang, who is in charge of Guihang’s special training, is the lack of softer training venues. During special training and movements such as rolling and lying down, the hard cement floor will aggravate the students&#39; scratches. However, the plastic badminton court on Guihang South Campus cannot be used because it is close to classrooms for other grades. The playground with a 400-meter track in the North Campus needs to be shared by 7 camps. Instructor Zhang sometimes felt a little crowded, so he had to take the team to a corner of the playground for training. They had only rehearsed the full tactical display with ample space once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guidian’s way of solving the problem is to make full use of the roads on campus. You Jiangjiao pointed out, &quot;By clearing the electric vehicles parked on the road to one side, the area of ​​the training venue can be increased, and the separated teams can train here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Universities such as Guihang and Guidian, It has a military-industrial nature, and it is more convenient to communicate with the local military region and borrow resources such as simulated firearms during military training. But in general colleges and universities, it is relatively difficult to borrow. Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University&#39;s approach is for the school to purchase its own military training teaching aids. The special training team always has more than 40 model guns, and other students can only get 2-3 guns per company on average. The average price of a model gun is a few hundred yuan. If it is to ensure that every student participating in the training has one like a special training team, it will also be a big expense for a school that provides military training for five to six thousand freshmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zhipeng believes that the implementation of the compulsory content required by the &quot;Military Course Syllabus for General Colleges and Universities&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;such as light weapons shooting, battlefield medical treatment First aid, etc.&lt;/span>;), so that more ordinary students can have the experience of hard-core military training, it is necessary to &quot;increase resource investment, strengthen policy supply, and create a professional team of national defense education teachers. At the same time, teaching must incorporate the latest technologies VR, The introduction of informatization and intelligent equipment such as drones into military training will enhance the four flavors of military training, namely fun, military flavor, war flavor and technological flavor, and improve student participation and educational effect.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Lin Yu, Shen Hong, and Li Ming in the article are pseudonyms.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国常会审议通过《人体器官捐献和移植条例（修订草案）》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259053]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Li Qiang presided over the executive meeting of the State Council&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;State Council&#39;s Notice on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Decision on Fine Matters&quot; and &quot;Regulations on Human Organ Donation and Transplantation (Revised Draft)&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Premier Li Qiang chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on October 20 to review and adopt the &quot;State Council&#39;s Notice on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Fine Matters&quot; Decision&quot; and &quot;Human Organ Donation and Transplantation Regulations (Revised Draft)&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting pointed out that strictly regulating penalties and fine standards is an important measure to optimize the business environment and reduce operating costs. It is necessary to continue to reduce fines and reduce fines that violate legal authority, do not meet the needs of economic and social development, and can be managed in other ways. It is necessary to strictly regulate the discretionary power of administrative penalties, intensify efforts to rectify arbitrary fines, improve collaborative governance and joint punishment mechanisms, seriously investigate and punish behaviors such as the administration of fines and excessive fines, increase exposure to the society, and prevent all types of benefits. The effect of corporate policies is weakened or offset. Efforts should be made to strengthen interim and ex-post supervision, improve supervision methods, standardize supervision procedures, improve supervision efficiency, and effectively strengthen supervision in key areas such as production safety, life and health, and product quality, so as to provide strong support for promoting high-quality development. According to the meeting&#39;s deliberations, it is planned to cancel and adjust 33 fines in administrative regulations and departmental rules as a package. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting emphasized that human organ donation and transplantation are acts of great love and charity in the world, related to the lives and health of the people, bioethics and social justice, and are an important symbol of the development of national medicine and the progress of social civilization. We must put people and life first, further regulate human organ donation and transplantation, ensure the quality of medical care, protect human health, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens. It is necessary to take this revision of the regulations as an opportunity to strengthen legal protection, establish a full-process traceability and supervision mechanism, strengthen the construction of the organ donation work system, strengthen the ethical review of organ procurement, crack down on and investigate organ-related crimes in accordance with the law, and better protect the organ donation and The transplantation industry is developing healthily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other matters were also considered at the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以色列进攻加沙有多难？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258963]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/xR91tMnZtrplBiQuvhY8Iwfs2YUaEY5bS0FgMwuo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/xR91tMnZtrplBiQuvhY8Iwfs2YUa ​​EY5bS0FgMwuo. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254430&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 13, 2023, Israeli troops assembled on the Israeli side of the Gaza border &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, due to the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict caused by attacks launched by Hamas, Israel was attacked after Quickly mobilize and assemble a large number of troops, preparing to enter the Gaza Strip from the ground to completely eliminate the armed forces of the Hamas organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the Israeli army has an absolute strength advantage and there is no suspense about victory or defeat, the Israeli soldiers will undoubtedly face a very complex battlefield. Militants who have been lying in wait for a long time are waiting for the Israeli army to enter. They have a large number of Tunnel bunkers were available and large quantities of anti-tank weapons and explosives were prepared. What’s even more troublesome is that not only do a large number of local civilians in the Gaza Strip have nowhere to go, Hamas forces also control many hostages taken from Israel, which makes offensive operations more inconvenient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, 2023 local time, Israel gave residents in northern Gaza 24 hours to leave their homes and go to the south to escape the fighting. Therefore, there are constant rumors that Israel will soon launch a ground attack on Gaza. However, in my personal judgment, Israel&#39;s full-scale offensive will not begin anytime soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the sudden incident, even though Israel&#39;s mobilization efficiency was very high and 300,000 reservists were recalled within one day, the reorganization, equipment distribution and familiarization of these troops, as well as pre-war mobilization, still took time. In addition, fire sweep before ground troops enter is also necessary. According to local news, in addition to dispatching its air force to attack hundreds of targets every day, Israel&#39;s artillery is also constantly shelling targets in northern Gaza at half-minute intervals. The purpose of these attacks is not only to destroy Hamas targets that have been discovered, but also as a psychological warfare method to constantly tire and disturb the enemy, forcing local civilians to flee as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of attack is a typical pre-war softening method for urban warfare, just like the use of shock bombs in anti-terrorism operations, leaving the opponent confused and unable to accurately judge the time to launch a ground attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to tactical strikes, Israel has also implemented a siege policy on the Gaza Strip, cutting off water, electricity, and communications. This was not only intended to punish the local population but was also intended to affect Hamas&#39;s military communications. Since Hamas is an organization that is inseparable from civilians and military, its communications rely heavily on civilian networks and mobile phone base stations. If its power and network communications are cut off, it will not only be difficult for Hamas armed personnel to charge their electronic devices, but they will also need to add additional communications. Means to ensure smooth communication during wartime. The delay in entering after cutting off the water and power grid is actually to wait for Hamas to activate the backup communication means to conduct subsequent electronic reconnaissance, and to master the frequency band, communication habits and encryption methods of Hamas&#39;s backup communication, so that the Israeli military can launch attacks on the ground Then interfere or locate the communicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, the newly mobilized troops and active units still need to conduct some necessary pre-war drills to become familiar with the intended battlefield environment and continuously improve the combat plan. Intelligence and reconnaissance units also need to conduct necessary pre-war reconnaissance to further grasp the real-time battlefield situation and enemy conditions. Whether it is technical reconnaissance, human reconnaissance or fire reconnaissance, it requires a lot of time and resources to complete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the above technical laws of war, Israel&#39;s full-scale attack on the Gaza Strip will require at least 2-6 weeks of pre-war preparation time. All current information about launching a ground attack is likely to be interference signals released by Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Israel launched its ground attack, it certainly faced many challenges, of which the outside world was most concerned about Hamas’s tunnel warfare methods. There may be an entire city&#39;s worth of tunnels and bunkers beneath the surface of Gaza, where Hamas can constantly evade Israeli ground fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Gaza is actually not as strong as the city fortresses such as Bahmut and Mariupol in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern war machines are extremely destructive. Only modern industrialized reinforced concrete structures can withstand artillery attacks to a certain extent. Ukraine is an industrialized country, and most of its buildings are built with modern construction techniques and can easily be transformed into fortresses that can withstand artillery fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the houses in the Gaza Strip are brick-concrete structures. Judging from the experience of blasting operations, brick-concrete structures are actually not very resistant to attacks by modern weapons. Large-caliber machine guns can even penetrate brick-concrete structures directly. For the exterior wall of a structural house, the fragments of the internal wall that explode while penetrating can even become anti-personnel shotguns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, using wall-breaking bombs for blasting operations can easily open new attack channels on the opponent&#39;s wall. The main reason why urban street fighting is terrifying is that the defender can concentrate its firepower in the killing traps set by itself. However, if the attacker can bypass the killing traps, the traps will be useless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the issue of tunnels, although tunnels can hide the traces of Hamas on weekdays, there are actually many means of detection and destruction of tunnels during wartime. To deal with tunnels in plain areas, you generally only need to control the ground first, then detect them through technical means, and destroy them with weapons such as cloud bombs. At the same time, you can also use cement trucks to grout all the detected entrances and exits. If Hamas cannot gain a foothold on the ground and simply takes shelter in the tunnels, the Israeli army can easily destroy the tunnels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel also has a capability that has not been seen in past wars, which is the world&#39;s first-class design and manufacturing capabilities of cruise missiles, drones and unmanned combat robots. Israel was the first country to use cruise missiles in war, and it is still the leader in the research and development of this technology. Even the U.S. military is purchasing Israeli-made cruise missiles to equip the army. Although Israel suffered heavy losses from Hamas drone attacks in previous attacks, in future operations, Israel&#39;s loitering bombs, drones and combat robots may attack in full. Even though Hamas has learned to use drones to deal with tanks, it does not have the corresponding anti-drone and loitering missile capabilities. The ground attack will inevitably be accompanied by the reconnaissance and surveillance of a large number of drones and the attack of loitering missiles. This is Russia and Ukraine. A capability that neither Russia nor Ukraine has on the battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any case, Israel’s ground attack will be a joint attack of sea, air, ground and unmanned systems, which will undoubtedly give the outside world an opportunity to peek into new tactics for urban combat in future wars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王培军：我所喜看的九部电影]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258957]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/20/Tl3bAwVIiWDjuln3lIIiPIfXFnKQo1vmQZXWH3OU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/Tl3bAwVIiWDjuln3lIIiPIfXFnKQo1v mQZXWH3OU. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254699&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last verse of &quot;Vajra Prajnaparamita Sutra&quot; says: &quot;All conditioned dharma, such as A dream is like a bubble. It is like dew or lightning. It should be viewed as such.&quot; Thirty-three years ago, when I was in college, I went to Mingjiao Temple with my classmates and bought this Diamond Sutra. I didn&#39;t realize at all at that time that the names of the movies that modern people love to watch were already mentioned here, and the profound meaning contained in the word &quot;movie&quot; was also revealed in these few sentences. Life is like a movie, and movies are literally &quot;like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew and lightning.&quot; Movies are just the shadow of life, and life is just a shadow like a movie. Most people like to watch movies, just like children who like to watch the shadows of everything and are endlessly curious about them. I can&#39;t count how many movies I&#39;ve watched, but I know the movies I watch many times because I like them. Even if you watch a good movie, if you watch it too much and you are overly familiar with it, you will definitely get bored and will not want to watch it again. This is just like delicious food, if you do not exercise restraint and eat too much to its upper limit, you will definitely get bored. , sometimes even vomiting after eating, vowing never to eat again. This is the opposite of things. Everything in the world has this dialectic. But how many times do you watch it before you get bored? The number of times you get bored is obviously a measure that can be used to detect the quality of a movie and how much you like it. The following nine movies are ones that I have watched many times but have grown tired of and do not want to watch again in the near future - of course because they are good to watch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/90EHlvLkm3J5RX3wvb61RptQMwpAiWtefgYq1Zz1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/90EHlvLkm3J5RX3wvb61RptQMwpAiWtefgYq1Zz1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254703&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; 》Part 1 (1987). The first time I watched &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; was the third part, which was in the mid-1990s. There is only one scene that I remember now, that is, Shifang&#39;s master grew his own long ears to cover his eyes because he couldn&#39;t beat the grandma. I watched it again later, and all I remember is still this incident. I watched the first part six or seven times, maybe more. &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; is based on the &quot;Nie Xiaoqian&quot; chapter of &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. This is a well-known story that many people are familiar with when they were young. After being rewritten in the movie, it can be said to be &quot;beyond all recognition.&quot; But it is undoubtedly more exciting than the novel, and much better than Pu Liuxian. Although &quot;Nie Xiaoqian&quot; is famous in &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;, it is not the best chapter. I think Wang Zuxian is indeed very beautiful in this movie, and it can also be said to be the most beautiful time in his life. Some places are very poetic, such as Nie Xiaoqian hiding Ning Caichen in a water tank, in order to give Ning Caichen The scene where they had to kiss each other to take a breath was actually the highlight of the film. The tension of the atmosphere and the romance of the situation are all combined into one, and the cleverness of its conception can only be achieved by the so-called &quot;intelligent literati&quot;. But if we talk about Nie Xiaoqian&#39;s beauty, the most beautiful part is not here, but the part where she says, &quot;Ghosts are as good and bad as people, and many people in the world are more harmful to people than ghosts.&quot; Her words are so smooth and beautiful. , also complement each other. Generally speaking, the beauty of a woman&#39;s expression is to smile first, and to think secondly. Laughing and laughing wildly will inevitably impair the beauty. Therefore, the ancients had the precept &quot;laughing will not cause stagnation&quot;, &quot;smile&quot; refers to the gums, and laughter It&#39;s not beautiful when you see your gums. The same goes for crying. If you can look beautiful even when you cry, then you are truly a beautiful person. The shot of Nie Xiaoqian talking and crying at the same time is absolutely beautiful. It can also be said to be the most beautiful shot in the film. The so-called &quot;pear blossom brings rain in spring&quot; is nothing more than that! In the TV series &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, the character who plays sister Lin who loves to cry cries so much that it&#39;s hard to watch, which often ruins the scene. I have to say that this is also a failure in the drama &quot;Red&quot;. One night not long ago, I accidentally heard someone singing &quot;Flower Sacrifice&quot;. I was curious, so I searched for Wang Zuxian again and found that she was already very old. Therefore, I remembered the famous saying of the ancients: &quot;Beauty has been like a famous general since ancient times. See you grow old!&quot; Yes, everything in the world cannot withstand the flow of time. On the contrary, movies are illusory and unreal, they can remain unchanged forever, and they can allow us to relive the time that has passed! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3jyQAmXsfn8k8ngBMz8RKYLtcTMqOszICqJy04Yn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;667&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3jyQAmXsfn8k8ngBMz8RKYLtcTMqOszICqJy04Yn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254701&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Green Snake&quot; 》(1993). This is one of Tsui Hark&#39;s best films, written by Li Bihua. I wrote a poem called &quot;Qijue&quot; about this film: &quot;Qing Lei washes the horse&#39;s sentimental bones, and shows the unparalleled beauty of Wen Jun. Such a charming person can be passed down together, and Xu Jun&#39;s talent is so wonderful.&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; is a couplet written by Feng Ban in the Qing Dynasty. I thought it was quite right, so I borrowed it. I have always believed that the best match between a talented man (including a scholar) and a beautiful woman is the most elusive. The reason is not easy to know, but it may also be caused by the fact that the same colors are placed together and cannot serve as a foil to each other. The talented man and the beautiful woman are of course the same color. The opposite is not true. For example, pairing Tu Xingsun with Deng Chanyu and Wang Dwarf with Yizhang Qing are wonderful and unforgettable. Wu Changshuo, a recent scholar, had a painting of Zhu Luanshi and orchid. He also wrote a poem about it: &quot;Like a slave from Kunlun, standing by the side of a beauty.&quot; Orchid is the national fragrance, and Zhu Luanshi&#39;s skin is very thick, so he wrote it together in One picture looks strange and interesting by contrast, which is the essence of knowing what it is. The essence of a love story is a matter of matching. If the heroine and the male character are matched well, the story will be outstanding. If they are not matched well, it will be easy to fall into the trap. The combination of a talented man and a beautiful woman is the easiest one to fall into, so writing stories about talented men and beautiful women is always thankless. This is something that even the old lady in Jia&#39;s family can criticize. &quot;Green Snake&quot; is also a story of a talented man and a beautiful woman, but it is very good. The reason why it can be like this may be because of Xiao Qing&#39;s background. This is probably why the movie is called &quot;Green Snake&quot;. But no matter what, the main body of the movie&#39;s story is actually a &quot;charming&quot; tone like Zhang Jiqing&#39;s version of &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot;. Perhaps it can be said that &quot;Green Snake&quot; in the movie is just like &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot; in the play, It can be used as a footnote to the words &quot;charming to the bone&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/03yYLvvBIobhX8CwXQhUSOs9VUAfBZok6PUU5WxS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/03yYLvvBIobhX8CwXQhUSOs9VUAfBZok6PUU5WxS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254704&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《新龙门Inn&quot; (1992). Maggie Cheung and Joey Wong in &quot;Green Snake&quot; complement each other and perform well, but in person, it cannot be regarded as their best work. The ultimate role played by Maggie Cheung is undoubtedly the outrageous landlady Jin Xiangyu in &quot;New Dragon Gate Inn&quot;. His temperament is uninhibited, his language is sharp and fluent, and his expressions and body movements are varied. They are all unstoppable, yet natural and subtle, all of which are smooth. This should be something that ordinary viewers can appreciate. However, Jin Xiangyu is just a common man in the market. Although he is not annoying, he cannot be said to be very cute. She is not a good match for Zhou Huai&#39;an either. She finally burns down the inn and chases Zhou away on horseback. It seems that she can take Qiu Mochou&#39;s place and marry Zhou; but in fact this is just an easy way to end the movie. From an article point of view, this inn must be burned down, and Qiu Mochou had no choice but to die. Otherwise, the article would be useless. Jin Shengtan commented on &quot;Lu Zhishen&#39;s Fire Burning Waguan Temple&quot; in the fifth chapter of &quot;Water Margin&quot;. He said it well: &quot;A writer is like a painter, and like a fire gathering, he is created and destroyed at will.&quot; Movies are also articles. , the same is true. But what I admire most about this film is not that, but the fact that in the film, no less than dozens of people from all walks of life were crammed into that small inn, allowing them to express themselves in a small space. And each has its own face, ever-changing, and everyone is different. The characters are constantly fighting each other, murderous intentions are everywhere, and they are jealous. The scenery is beautiful and embellished with the beauty of &quot;sheng Xiao, drums, harps and bells&quot;. Their relationships are complicated, their crises are about to break out, and their literary sentiments It is in full swing, a grand spectacle of &quot;acting&quot;, and the center of all these characters is gold inlaid with jade, as if gold inlaid with jade is a mechanism, and all the people and affairs in it are controlled and mediated by her. In fact, she is just The clue that the film uses to string together the drama is like the &quot;hanging string&quot; of a puppet show, which moves the whole body when pulled. Not only that, although there are many characters and clues in the inn, they are not chaotic at all. At first glance, they look like leaves blown by the wind, but upon closer inspection, they are well-organized, &quot;gray lines of grass and snakes&quot;, just like what Su Shi said in his poem about painting: &quot;There are countless leaves moving in chaos, and the source can be found for each one.&quot; This is really admirable. As for the wonderful dialogue in the movie, it is still a matter of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/mJ7ZrWlcCdzDNl6PCQqTwkIziYEOGguGVBesjr8n.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1571&quot; height= &quot;2098&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/mJ7ZrWlcCdzDNl6PCQqTwkIziYEOGguGVBesjr8n.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254713&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Swordsman&quot; Jianghu: The Invincible East&quot; (1992). In terms of fighting action, this film is more exciting than &quot;New Dragon Inn&quot;. As far as the Invincible Dongfang played by Brigitte Lin is concerned, it is much more beautiful than the gold-encrusted jade played by Maggie Cheung. In the movie, Linghu Chong&#39;s heroic spirit, Ren Yingying&#39;s lingering affection, and the unanimous agreement of a group of Huashan disciples who want to withdraw from the world and return to Niubei Mountain, all of which make this movie more tonal than &quot;New Dragon Inn&quot;. It is warmer and more beautiful. What is inferior to &quot;New Dragon Inn&quot; is that the characters&#39; hearts are not so changeable and subtle, but slightly thicker. However, several scenes in this film can be said to be worthy of being double-circled according to the ancient method of criticizing articles. Some of them can also be marked as &quot;famous lines, there can be no two in the ages&quot;, such as the East is undefeated in the water. The scene where he is drinking from a jug of wine, and the scene where Linghu Chong is holding Dongfang Bubai and walking in the wind under the moonlight. The scene where Lan Fenghuang and Ren Yingying are sitting on the roof has a wonderful voice, which can be said to be the best in Tang Dynasty Legend and &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. It’s just that Ren Yingying’s dresser’s face seems wrong, she looks a little older, and she speaks in a dialect, which is not only unattractive (Lan Fenghuang speaks in a dialect, but it’s not unattractive), but also doesn’t suit the status of a young lady. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/AUMphw2CHIOe3CFfP9re5ZJiHmz3mIHKFeu8ASdu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;662&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/AUMphw2CHIOe3CFfP9re5ZJiHmz3mIHKFeu8ASdu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254702&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Kung Fu&quot; (2004). I enjoy watching most of Stephen Chow&#39;s movies, and the reason why I recommend this one the most is because the last fight scene can be said to be the pinnacle of Chinese fight scenes. Stephen Chow loves to parody, and his scene where he beats the men in black from the Ax Gang flying all over the place should be an imitation of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. Many years ago, I was watching &quot;Mechanic: Resurrection&quot; on TV. There was a scene where the killer jumped from a cable car to a paraglider. My son saw it and said excitedly: &quot; The game I played also had this action, and it turned out to be from here. This is the programmer&#39;s tribute to the movie!&quot; This is the first time I have heard that &quot;imitation is tribute.&quot; But I&#39;m not sure whether &quot;Kung Fu&quot; is a tribute to &quot;The Matrix&quot;. But there is no doubt that this scene in &quot;Kung Fu&quot; is much better than &quot;The Matrix&quot;. What Chinese fighting dramas value is not &quot;working hard&quot; or &quot;working hard&quot;, which is never the high state of Chinese art. What the Chinese want is to be light-weighted, to be busy, to speak in a subtle way, to wave and watch, or to be careless. , not attached to the appearance, leisurely and leisurely, all traces are gone, but &quot;the power is small but the responsibility is heavy&quot;, &quot;the tripod is lifted with great skill&quot;, it has been a great laughing stock since ancient times. This is true of everything. Therefore, although the fight scene in &quot;Kung Fu&quot; sent others flying all over the sky, Stephen Chow&#39;s own expression was not strenuous. The general atmosphere was light and beautiful, unlike in &quot;The Matrix&quot; The way Neo fights with a lot of agents in black and exhausts all his strength makes it obvious that he is better than the other. This can be seen from a comparison and needs no further explanation. If human beings indeed evolved from ancient apes, then the Chinese people must have evolved much further, and the same is true for Chinese culture. It has shed all its wildness, including spiritual and material aspects, and of course, Martial arts. As for the main theme of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, I think it is the same as Gong Zizhen&#39;s &quot;Zun Yin&quot;: In the twilight world, heroes are born, &quot;Ugly people are ugly, deceitful and incompetent, they are chariots and they are responsible&quot;, &quot;In this case, heroes are born&quot; The capital is light, but the power in the mountains is heavy.&quot; In other words, the masters in the last days are all hidden among the people. Therefore, the official police station at the beginning of the movie is the most useless. Later, the crocodile gang, the ax gang, the tailors in the slums, the coolies and the fried ghosts, the two blind men, the charterer, the charterer, the fire cloud evil god, and a They are inconspicuous compared to each other, but each one is more skilled than the other. However, the highest master in the movie is the star who was deceived by a beggar in his most useless hour with a two-cent copy of &quot;The Palm of the Tathagata&quot;, and that copy was only The &quot;Tathagata Divine Palm&quot; worth two cents is the real &quot;martial arts secret book&quot; that is the best in the world! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/fKJX1gYlMOy8NqtUWf3ignbptbgVdaFqILnIZymI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;652&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/fKJX1gYlMOy8NqtUWf3ignbptbgVdaFqILnIZymI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254705&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; 》 (Cold Mountain, 2003). This is a love movie set in the American Civil War. The male protagonist Inman is a soldier who deserted for the sake of his beloved Ada and wants to return to his hometown. Of course, he finally went through hardships and returned to his lover, but he was beaten to death in the end. This is an Odysseus-like story that is somewhat similar to &quot;Ten Years Home&quot;. The story itself cannot be said to be new in the West. The movie is adapted from a best-selling novel in the United States. It is said that it is a true event that happened to the author&#39;s ancestors. What I like about this movie is not the story, but the characters. The sad music that lingers in the movie also plays a significant role, because it gives the movie the tone of a long, lyrical poem. Inman, played by Jude Law, and Ada, played by Nicole Kidman, are so well matched that they are a joy to watch. I would also like to see young people become married in a well-matched love. WS Maugham once said that the maximum age for a person to fall in love should not exceed thirty-five. I think it makes sense. A love story must be a little gorgeous to be beautiful, and to be gorgeous, the first condition is youth. At the same time, in love stories, there must also be a kind of unrequited love and infatuation to move people. The word &quot;qing&quot; in the heart part of &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; says: &quot;Qing refers to the yin energy of a person with desires.&quot; It is different from &quot;xing&quot; which refers to the yang energy of a person. Nature is received from heaven, which is called nature, so it is unchanging; emotions originate from human affairs, which is called human feelings, so it is changeable. There are seven emotions, including joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, evil, and desire, which are changing all the time. But things in the world are sometimes very strange. Things that are easy to change are better if they remain unchanged, and things that are not easy to change are better if they are changed. Therefore, articles become better when they are new, and love becomes better when they remain unchanged. This is also &quot;rare and valuable&quot; - because it is &quot;hard to be possible&quot;, it is &quot;valuable&quot;. This is the reason why Inman and Ada&#39;s love story touches people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/LXqVl4OWvfbzFMXAMCfThxewWcdHMRuVXZTTC0sB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2025&quot; height= &quot;3000&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/LXqVl4OWvfbzFMXAMCfThxewWcdHMRuVXZTTC0sB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254706&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Artificial Intelligence 》(AI Artificial Intelligence, 2001). This one is relatively unnoticed among Steven Spielberg&#39;s films, but it&#39;s one of my favorites. This is a sad and sad story about a robot child who persistently searches for love. Watching this movie, I feel the same kind of melancholy that I felt when I was reading Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s &quot;The Daughter of the Sea&quot; as a child, as if somewhere in my heart was lightly touched by a piano string. For a moment, a vague sadness arose. In fact, the story of the movie is not the same as that of &quot;The Daughter of the Sea&quot;. Spielberg is really a genius. It stands to reason that robots are mechanically made, precise, high-end, effective, and have no human heart, so the machinery is ruthless; but he prefers to make a fuss about the word love, making the machine and the weakest part of human emotions create a story. This can be said to be a very unique ingenuity, and the whole movie also wins with uniqueness. The kid also acted very well. In addition, Jude Law, who played Inman in &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, plays a robot made to be a frivolous young man in this film. He is also lifelike. It is completely different from Inman&#39;s image and is almost unrecognizable. It&#39;s also something that can be mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3a5V5aE0HHpcnUndKkWzvFtLwyKFH9ZSvTYYwepR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;615&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3a5V5aE0HHpcnUndKkWzvFtLwyKFH9ZSvTYYwepR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254707&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Interstellar&quot; ” (Interstellar, 2014). This is a movie about time. Time is a mystery in the universe, and it is also the most fascinating and troublesome thing in the universe. It has caused the contemplation of philosophers and the chanting of poets since ancient times, but it cannot be defined or captured. &quot;Life is less than a hundred years old, and we often worry about a thousand years old.&quot; Life is only a hundred years old, and a hundred years is 3.15576 billion seconds. However, what we are thinking about is sometimes 10 billion 31557600 seconds away. Every second in the universe is like a flash of lightning, fleeting, and so is every second in a hundred years. So Heraclitus of Ephesus said, &quot;On those that step into the same rivers different and different waters flow.&quot; &quot;Time withers the beauty of youth, and destroys beauty&#39;s eyebrows. It feasts on the delicacies of natural truth, and all things are waiting for its sickle to cut it.&quot; The movie directed by Nolan, 2010&#39;s &quot;Inception&quot;, is also something I like to watch; but after watching it twice, I don&#39;t want to watch it again. This is a common problem in all films (including other works) that rely on novelty to win, and it is inevitable. But &quot;Interstellar&quot; is different. Its content is much richer, and its scenes are so grand, vast, and sometimes poetic, conveying a kind of solemnity and mystery that can only be found in the deep universe. Of all the science fiction films, this is the one I have watched the most and is also my favorite. One year I read Liu Guangdi&#39;s poems, and there was a couplet in it, which was about Xiling Gorge: &quot;The big waves are sinking into traps, and the long boats stand like cones.&quot; I immediately thought of the endless shallow water on Miller&#39;s planet. Then, a huge wave came over like a cliff. The big spaceship suddenly looked like a small long box, being lifted up by the huge wave. This shot can be called one of the genius&#39;s works, and it is thrilling. Of course, it is not something that can be copied by recent poems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/D0X5B75SkBgJM91PU5UhoRWzkST9YxnNd3rTVL3C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;1733&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/D0X5B75SkBgJM91PU5UhoRWzkST9YxnNd3rTVL3C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254700&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Deep Blue&quot; (Deep Blue, 2003). This film can be said to be an epic masterpiece, a meditative masterpiece, and the work that best demonstrates the great spirit of the West. The West is indeed far superior to China in terms of majesty and grandeur, just as China&#39;s wind, spirit and elegance are beyond the reach of the West. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else to say about this movie other than to watch it. Confucius said &quot;Speechless&quot;, I had the same feeling after watching this movie. In other words, criticism is sometimes unnecessary, just appreciate it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I originally wanted to make up the &quot;ten movies&quot;, but after much deliberation, I couldn&#39;t think of another one, so I had to forget it. Later, I changed my mind and remembered Wang Rongfu&#39;s &quot;Shi Sanjiu&quot;, which said, &quot;When accumulated to ten, it returns to one. Ten cannot be counted, so nine is the end of counting.&quot; Nine is the largest number, and &quot;Nine Parts&quot; &quot;movie&quot; is just the right number, so why do we need to get to &quot;ten&quot;? Moreover, aren&#39;t the lines of the sixty-four hexagrams also named after &quot;Nine&quot;, referring to the ninth day, the ninth day, the ninth day, the ninth day, the ninth day, the fifth day, etc.? In fact, it is not only &quot;nine&quot;, but also &quot;nineteen&quot;, which is also a large number. The ancient calendar uses nineteen years as one chapter. The birthdays of the lunar calendar will not coincide with the birthdays of the solar calendar after nineteen years. Therefore, &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; says &quot;Today&#39;s birthday&quot; I have been holding the sword for nineteen years.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
