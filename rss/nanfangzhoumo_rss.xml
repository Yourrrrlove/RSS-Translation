In 2023, Fangcao Magazine, a public institution affiliated with the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles, announced a special recruitment list, including young writers Ban Yu, Chen Chuncheng, Wang Suxin, and Dan Bao (Liu Xueting). This incident once again caused netizens to lament that &quot;the end of the universe is the exam editor&quot;. The public list shows that Ban Yu, Chen Chuncheng and Wang Suxin &quot;successfully landed&quot;, while Dan Bao unfortunately lost his name to Sun Shan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the topic of this news is not as popular as last year&#39;s &quot;Celebrity Editorial Examination&quot; incident, it also raises some issues worthy of in-depth discussion. The reason why this &quot;writer test&quot; has aroused heated discussions is because there are problems with the character design and selection, which caused a strong sense of violation to the outside world. This point deserves special analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ban Yu was once known as one of the &quot;Three Heroes of the Northeastern Renaissance&quot;. He is the author of the novel collection &quot;Winter Swimming&quot; and the literary planner of the suspense drama &quot;The Long Season&quot;. A major theme of this hit drama, which is set against the backdrop of the layoff wave in Northeast China at the end of the last century, is the reflection on the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot;, especially its restraint and alienation of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Danbao has a background in sociology and anthropology. Her literary works focus on gender and class issues, and she also specializes in non-fiction writing. She has long been shown to be &quot;concerned with reality&quot;, which is consistent with how she looks at it. &quot;Preparation&quot; has nothing to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No wonder some netizens commented that when they saw this news about &quot;Writer&#39;s Examination for Editorial Examination&quot;, they felt like &quot;Sun Wukong passed the exam for editorship in the Heavenly Palace&quot; and &quot;Winter Swimming&quot; was finally released. Among them, Danbao also liked The Internet nickname &quot;Shen Gongbao&quot; was mentioned. There is no other reason than that the writer&#39;s previous works and &quot;personality&quot; are in great contrast with the editor&#39;s behavior, which makes readers feel inconsistent. Contrasting Danbao&#39;s statement in an interview that &quot;how a person writes is how he lives&quot;, the short four words &quot;writer&#39;s test&quot; have made &quot;how to write&quot; and &quot;how to live&quot; contradict each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the writer himself is completely invisible outside the work and does not expect readers to understand him &quot;like an old hen after eating eggs&quot;, then the &quot;writer&#39;s examination&quot; will not cause such a big stir Controversy, such as those writers who live in reclusion, rarely appear in public and do not engage in marketing. The problem is that today&#39;s cultural world has become highly marketized. In addition to literary works, young writers also sell &quot;personalities&quot; constructed through various online and offline interviews, speeches, meetings, and sharing sessions. This distinctive &quot;Personal IP&quot; is sold as a cultural commodity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of the young writers who took the exam this time, they are more or less operating market-oriented characters. This kind of characters has also helped them achieve the success of their works, and even have other works besides their works. Success, readers who spend money to buy books will not only buy the works of writers, but also the &quot;persona&quot; of their marketing packaging, as well as the values ​​and lifestyles contained in them. Readers expect them to live up to their personas and are appropriately disappointed when they fail to live up to their words and deeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, there is no law or regulation that prohibits these young writers from taking exams. Of course, a free and open modern society also allows a person to practice his values ​​​​and lifestyle, but their &quot;glorious turn&quot; also It&#39;s a bit &quot;out of the blue&quot;, and naturally it&#39;s inevitable for the outside world and even followers to question: Why do they want to take the exam? What can compilation bring to these young writers who have achieved considerable success? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Wuhan Institute of Literary and Art Theory (Fangcao Magazine) is a secondary public institution affiliated to Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Its business scope mainly includes various literary academic research, editing, publishing and distribution of &quot;Fangcao Magazine&quot; 》Literary Journal. The recruitment conditions announced on the official website show that in addition to being under 40 years old, applicants also need to meet &quot;one of three conditions&quot;: the work has won a provincial journal literary award, and has been published in a Chinese core journal or a publishing house at or above the provincial level. He has published works of more than 300,000 words, and his works have been shortlisted for several specific literary rankings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recruitment requirements for this preparation examination are quite high. The three requirements will probably eliminate the vast majority of &quot;ordinary question-answers&quot;. According to the published score sheet and admission list, this &quot;entry examination&quot; is divided into two categories: professional ability review and interview results. The final ranking is based on comprehensive performance. There is no written test. It can be seen that it is different from the ordinary &quot;public examination&quot;. &quot;Examination and Editing&quot; can be said to be tailor-made for the group of &quot;young writers&quot;. I would like to ask, why does a literary journal have such high recruitment requirements, and why can it attract many young writers to apply? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These young writers have already achieved success in the market, and there is no urgent need to escape competition to &quot;eat the royal food.&quot; Engaging in literary theory or editing work in institutional journals is somewhat overqualified. Therefore, a more reasonable inference is that the benefit brought by compilation is not the apparent &quot;iron rice bowl&quot;, but that it can provide these market-oriented writers with a better social status, or some kind of identity mark. The reason why young writers ask for Having an official position and a half-job position can probably take advantage of both sides. This is naturally in line with the decision-making of a &quot;rational economic man&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Academies hate geniuses just like monasteries hate saints&quot; has long been a consensus in the industry. Literary works should be left to the judgment of the market and the choice of readers. It is not necessary for the writer to obtain a certain &quot;seal of certification&quot; or have an official position in order for his works to be popular in the world. The ridicule suffered by several young writers also illustrates this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 10 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[开庭前拍摄法庭照片，律师手机被扣：一天后法院院长送还]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260322]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 10 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[受贿超9.795亿元，中信银行原行长孙德顺一审被判死缓]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260353]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10 18:26:42&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/10/b302121785ce1de591e109a5f01b5503.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;5413&quot; height=&quot;3371&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/10/b302121785ce1de591e109a5f01b5503.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257805&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 10, 2023, the Jinan Intermediate People’s Court of Shandong Province publicly sentenced Sun Deshun, the former president of CITIC Bank, for accepting bribes.

With the convenience of providing assistance to relevant enterprises in obtaining loans and other matters, they illegally received property equivalent to more than RMB 979.5 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinan Intermediate People’s Court held that defendant Sun Deshun’s behavior constituted the crime of accepting bribes. The amount of bribes Sun Deshun accepted was particularly huge, the circumstances of the crime were particularly serious, the social impact was particularly bad, and the interests of the country and the people suffered particularly heavy losses. He should be sentenced to death if found guilty. In view of the fact that Sun Deshun truthfully confessed his crime after returning to the case, confessed and repented, and actively returned the stolen goods. All the property obtained from bribery and its interest have been seized and brought to the case. There are statutory and discretionary circumstances for lenient punishment. He was sentenced to death, but it may not be executed immediately.

The court then made the above judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 10 Nov 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[女性省级党委专职副书记增至6名丨时政周报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260349]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti; text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt; img alt=&quot;On November 7, 2023, Sun Meijun, deputy secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee, conducted research in Lankao County.

In response, the Xiangyang Municipal Health Commission reported that the obstetrics and gynecology department of the hospital involved has been suspended for rectification, and the hospital director has been subject to criminal coercive measures and is under investigation. According to the latest news, the Xiangyang Municipal Public Security Bureau has upgraded the investigation of this case, and has initially verified the criminal facts of 5 cases of buying and selling birth certificates, and is further digging into other accusations such as baby trafficking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A medical birth certificate is a certificate issued by a medical institution for a newborn, including the newborn’s name, gender, date of birth, parents’ information, etc. This birth certificate, known as the &quot;first certificate in life&quot;, can play a role in proving the parent-child relationship during the subsequent settlement process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, fake medical birth certificates have become a very important link in the entire child trafficking industry chain. Using the information of the briber as the parents and creating a fake birth medical certificate, the abducted children can openly register as the briber&#39;s biological children at the police station and &quot;cleanse&quot; them. As a long-term anti-trafficking volunteer, Shangguan Zhengyi has encountered the other party many times during anti-trafficking operations to produce a &quot;medical birth certificate&quot; to prove that the child is his own. It was precisely because of this that he began to pay attention to and report the issue of falsification of medical birth certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time Shangguan Zhengyi attracted widespread attention was when he reported that nearly 5,000 stolen medical birth certificates from Shangqiu Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Henan were used for child trafficking. In 2016, during his anti-trafficking investigation, he discovered that someone in Fujian purchased a child and then registered it with an illegally obtained birth certificate. Some of the birth medical certificates came from Shangqiu Maternal and Child Health Hospital. Shangqiu Maternal and Child Health Hospital stated that as early as 2011, it discovered that a large number of medical birth certificates had been stolen. At that time, it reported to the police and published a newspaper statement stating that they were invalid. In 2012, it was discovered that a batch of birth certificates had been stolen twice, totaling 4,885 copies. The Shangqiu police stepped up their investigation and eventually found out that the theft was committed by insiders. The then section chief and deputy section chief of Shangqiu Maternal and Child Health Hospital who were responsible for managing birth medical certificates were all captured and sentenced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shangqiu Maternal and Child Health Hospital is not the only place where medical birth certificates have been stolen and used for illegal activities. This case is only more interesting because of the sheer number of stolen items. It is worth noting that these stolen medical birth certificates were declared invalid in newspapers. Therefore, strictly speaking, the certificates produced from these stolen certificates are invalid and false. However, because the database of the medical system is not connected with the public security department, it is difficult for the police station to verify the authenticity of the medical birth certificate when registering a newborn baby (in fact, the medical birth certificate does not use any high-end anti-counterfeiting technology). In addition, some police stations do not conduct strict inspections, so some completely forged birth certificates can be used to register for household registration, not to mention these &quot;fake certificates&quot; made from stolen &quot;real certificates&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case of selling medical birth certificates at Xiangyang Jianqiao Hospital goes a step further. The fake certificate they forged was not just a fake certificate, but a complete record in the health department&#39;s system. From the time of pregnancy to the hospital filing, all the way to the subsequent prenatal check-up and delivery, everything is recorded in the health system. The birth medical certificate and vaccination certificate are also available in the system. In other words, if you only look at the superficial documents, then this is so true that it cannot be truly “true proof”. Even if the police station gets the certificate from the health system to check its authenticity, it can only conclude that it is a genuine certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Xiangyang Jianqiao Hospital and its director Ye Youzhi are undoubtedly accomplices of child trafficking and have committed serious crimes. At present, some of the facts of his illegal sale of birth medical certificates have been verified, which has violated the crime of buying and selling official documents and documents of state agencies. But this is only a misdemeanor. The more serious charge is that if Ye Youzhi knew that the baby was abducted and issued a false birth medical certificate for him, he might be found to be an accomplice in child abduction. The minimum penalty for child abduction and trafficking is 5 years in prison, and in serious cases, the death penalty. Ye Youzhi once claimed that she &quot;committed a capital crime&quot;, which shows that it is very likely that she knew that the fake birth certificates issued were used on abducted children. How many fake birth certificates did she sell, and how many abducted children were &quot;laundered&quot; among them? It remains for the police to further investigate and follow the clues to uncover more criminals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiangyang Jianqiao Hospital and Ye Youzhi are not the only ones who forged medical birth certificates. As early as 2019, CCTV reported a case of forging medical birth certificates at a private hospital in Shehong, Sichuan. The method was exactly the same as that of Jianqiao Hospital. This time, Shangguan Zhengyi also reported hospitals in Nanning, Guangxi and other places. There are also more agents selling fake birth certificates active on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This black industrial chain that operates as a harbinger of evil must be severely cracked down on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 10 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[襄阳健桥医院“贩卖出生证明”事件：7人已被采取刑事强制措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260305]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A hospital in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province was recently reported to have &quot;colluded with intermediary gangs in many places to sell birth medical certificates&quot;, causing social concern focus on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The birth medical certificate is a statutory medical certification document stipulated in the &quot;Maternal and Infant Health Care Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and is an important basis for birth registration by the household registration authority.

According to Shangguan Zhengyi&#39;s understanding, the medical birth certificates sold are &quot;authentic and verifiable&quot;, and some are for abducted children, some for surrogate children, and some for abandoned babies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter learned from the interview that the Xiangyang Jianqiao Hospital involved was formerly known as Xiangyang 102 Hospital. In 2011, the hospital was transformed into a private hospital and changed to its current name in 2017. In 2020, Xiangyang Jianqiao Hospital (East District) was officially opened. The introduction at the hospital gate shows that Xiangyang Jianqiao Hospital (East District) is an integrated medical and nursing hospital in Xiangyang City featuring maternal and infant care. It provides pregnancy examinations, prenatal diagnosis, nutritional guidance, psychological consultation, childbirth, confinement care, Integrated services such as baby care and early education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter learned from the Xiangyang Municipal Health Commission on the 8th that the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Xiangyang Jianqiao Hospital has been suspended for rectification, and the hospital’s authority to issue medical birth certificates has been suspended. At the same time, a professional team has been arranged to provide consultation and care for pregnant women in the hospital involved, and make every effort to ensure the health and safety of pregnant women in the hospital.

However, it mainly focuses on medical services and medical safety, and does not involve the issuance of medical birth certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Xiangcheng District Branch of the Xiangyang Municipal Public Security Bureau told reporters on the 8th that starting from the evening of November 6, the public security department has been involved in the work and has completed relevant information inspection and personnel control in stages. The current focus of the work is to carry out investigation and evidence collection and verification one by one around the reporting clues, which is now being carried out in full swing. In order to improve the efficiency of investigation, the public security agencies at the two urban levels have established multi-type task forces to fully promote relevant work. Criminal coercive measures have been taken against seven suspects, including the director of the hospital involved and relevant staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Fill the loopholes and strengthen the &quot;gateway&quot; for issuance and registration of birth certificates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As early as 2009, the health department issued a notice requiring further strengthening of medical birth certificates. For standardized management, the issuing agency must implement the requirement of having dedicated personnel manage the birth medical certificate and seal respectively, and strictly enforce the issuance process. In December 2020, the national health department held a national work conference on the management of medical birth certificates, emphasizing the need to strictly manage issuance and ensure the implementation of the system. Relevant departments have issued repeated orders to strengthen education and training, and alarm bells are ringing at all times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Trafficking medical birth certificates of newborns can launder the identities of trafficked people.” A grassroots policeman who has been engaged in “anti-trafficking” work for a long time told reporters that when investigating human trafficking cases, DNA comparison results, birth certificates, etc. Medical certificates and household registration information form the basic chain of evidence. If a trafficked person obtains a legal medical certificate of birth, he or she can legally apply for household registration. It is difficult to form sufficient evidence based on DNA comparison results alone, which will bring serious challenges to case investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pan Yu, a partner at Hubei Yingchu Law Firm, pointed out that the birth medical certificate is a legal medical certificate used to prove the identity of the baby. It is a national agency document uniformly printed by relevant national departments and issued by the hospital. The behavior of the hospital director involved is suspected of forging and buying and selling state agency documents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, some interviewees said that loopholes must be filled, relevant management systems must be improved, and the &quot;gateway&quot; for the issuance and registration of birth medical certificates must be tightened as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police handling the case from the Xiangcheng District Branch of the Xiangyang Public Security Bureau said that the task force is currently using reported clues as an entry point to speed up the investigation. If new clues or new crimes are discovered during the process, they will never let them go. , we must investigate thoroughly and never tolerate it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 10 Nov 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[进博会偶遇中国驻伊朗大使常华：寻找共建“一带一路”的新方式]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260324]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10 15:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;November 7, 2023 is the second day of the official launch of the 6th CIIE, Southern Weekend reporter I ran into Chang Hua at the booth of an Iranian brand.

Baliji’s sales volume of hydrosol products this year has exceeded 10 million bottles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Without a platform like the CIIE, it would be impossible for Chinese people to understand Iran’s superior specialties, let alone a niche brand like ours.” Zhang Guicai said that in 2023, Balizhe would be The Iranian Consulate in Shanghai selected it as a special souvenir for the National Day reception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Balij’s current largest supplier is an Iranian factory called Dorrin Golab. The factory is responsible for the entire process from planting, picking, refining to production. Because of the purchasing power of the Chinese market, the factory has grown from 60 The number has expanded to nearly 200 this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dorrin Golab is a medicinal plant production company established in 1998 and belongs to the Medicinal Plants and Food Exporters Union under the Iranian Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mining and Agriculture (ICCIMA). One detail is that in addition to Farsi and English, the official website of the above-mentioned alliance also has Chinese pages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ICCIMA is the largest private business alliance in Iran. A message on the website on September 27 showed that Hussein Serawaz, chairman of the chamber of commerce, met with Chang Hua that day and said that it had been established. A task force on developing trade relations with China was established to further activate private sector trade through the chambers of commerce platform of both countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In August 2023, at the &quot;Iran-BRICS: Partnership and Cooperation Prospects&quot; seminar, Ambassador to Iran Chang Hua spoke.

This visit is very important. Important, indicating that the government attaches special importance to exports.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Many problems are slowly being solved, such as visas, foreign exchange transactions, etc. Under the &#39;Belt and Road&#39; system, the trade between China and Iran will definitely become more and more important. The more convenient it is,&quot; Zhang Guicai pointed out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, it is not surprising that customs clearance took several weeks in the past, but now it only takes one week for imported Iranian goods to be cleared domestically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Report on the Export Potential of Developing Countries Along the Belt and Road to China&quot; released by the United Nations International Trade Center (ITC) at this CIIE, before the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative in 2013, developing countries along the Belt and Road The country&#39;s total exports to China are approximately US$445 billion, and have reached US$798 billion in 2023, an increase of approximately 79%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sylvie Betang Kexin, the center’s Asia-Pacific Affairs Director, pointed out in a sub-forum at the CIIE that during the same period, the trade between developing countries along the “Belt and Road” and other parts of the world increased. Only 12%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ke Xin told Southern Weekend reporters after the meeting that the export growth of the “Belt and Road” countries to China in the past ten years was mainly concentrated in the primary industry, that is, chemical industry, ore and other raw material fields, “We We also look forward to further growth in the manufacturing industry in the future, from primary products to some high value-added processed products, which will further help the economic development of these countries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chang Hua is also thinking about how China-Iran trade can further develop in the context of US economic sanctions against Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;First of all, the U.S. sanctions are unreasonable.

The local commerce department or local trade promotion association has organized a large-scale visiting group. The Iranian market is very important to Chinese companies. increasingly attractive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June this year, a 45-member trade delegation from Jilin Province visited Tehran to participate in the &quot;Iran-China Trade Forum&quot; held on June 18. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 15th BRICS leaders’ meeting in August, six countries including Iran officially became members of the BRICS family, and their membership will take effect on January 1, 2024.

He sang as soon as he opened his mouth and asked everyone to sing along. The scene was very lively. He also asked everyone to recite it in this way after class. This is my first contact with singing, and it feels very fresh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are three articles that impressed me the most. The first is &quot;The Book of Songs·Binfeng·Dongshan&quot;: &quot;I went to Dongshan, melancholy and did not return. &lt;span>;I&lt;/span>; came from the east, and there was zero rain. &lt;span>;I&lt;/span>; said east and returned, &lt; span>;I&lt;/span>; am heartbroken.&quot; At that time, I was reading the Book of Songs, and my favorite poems were love poems, but this one was about the scene of returning from an expedition, which was very sad. The second is &quot;Li Sao&quot;, &quot;Tsuen is not aware of what is going on in the world&quot;, full of depression and complaints. The third is Cao Zhi&#39;s &quot;Ode to the Goddess of Luo&quot;. I still remember the way Mr. Liu recited &quot;In the third year of Huang Chu&#39;s reign, the capital of Yu Dynasty returned to Luochuan...&quot;. The chapters he recited all contained his life experiences and emotional resonance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu is from Wuxi, Jiangsu. Reciting was originally his &quot;teaching lesson&quot; when he was in private school. He regarded us as innocent children and diligently dedicated his treasures to us. In his later years, he enthusiastically advocated and promoted the art of classical poetry recitation. He once recorded and released &quot;Song Poetry Recitation&quot;, which can still be heard on the Himalayas website. Therefore, when students from different classes recall Mr. Liu’s classes or lectures, the first thing they mention is singing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poetry recitation is now on CCTV and is very fashionable, but at that time we felt it was fresh and had doubts: we should teach new knowledge in the classroom and spend such precious time teaching recitation. ,is this necessary? But Mr. Liu completely ignored the questioning glances from the audience and was immersed in his own world. He explained &quot;Li Sao&quot; and began to recite it as he spoke. He recited it so deeply that he was speechless and choked with tears. In addition, when he was happy in class, he would write his own old-style poems on the blackboard and sing them proudly - not wanting this to be a class on ancient literature - which some students complained about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the old gentleman in the Chinese Department, who was over 70 years old, no longer taught classes for undergraduates. Still in the first online basic class is an old man who is over sixty but not yet seventy years old. Because of this chant, Mr. Liu became the one who impressed the students the most. But among the students, there were some who admired it and some who took it as a joke. ——Everyone doesn’t respect him as much as they do other old gentlemen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was young and ignorant at that time. I neither understood the significance of reciting poetry or comprehending its charm, nor could I understand his knowledge. Before I graduated from my undergraduate degree, I applied for graduate school. My tutors in the literature major of Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties were Liu Caonan and Xu Shuofang, who were applying for novels and drama respectively. Although I had put a lot of effort into novels before, I still chose Quanwu in the end. Basic drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I listened to Mr. Liu’s class again when I was a graduate student. Each of the five tutors gave three lectures, which constituted one semester of graduate courses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu mentioned in class the &quot;Almanac&quot; and &quot;Tianguan Shu&quot; of &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Lü Li Zhi&quot;, &quot;Astronomical Records&quot; and &quot;Nine Chapters of Arithmetic&quot; in &quot;Han Shu&quot;. He said that when it came to calibrating astronomy, calendar and arithmetic, &quot;we&quot; were different from our predecessors in that we did not calibrate based on the version, but used modern mathematical methods to calculate and then make corrections (at that time, we could not say &quot;I&quot; more, we had to say &quot; us” to avoid the suspicion of individualism). I was in awe when I heard it. Because this is a real &quot;unique skill&quot;, it requires a strong foundation in modern mathematics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I heard that he had won the first prize in the school’s teachers’ mathematics competition (non-mathematics major group). Now Zhejiang University Press is editing and publishing &quot;The Complete Works of Liu Caonan&quot;, which is compiled into 22 volumes and has more than 6 million words. Among them, works related to calendars include &quot;Ancient Books and Science&quot;, &quot;A Search for Calendar Calculations&quot;, &quot;General Introduction to Ancient Calculations&quot;, &quot;Celestial Calendar Theory Collection&quot;, &quot;Interpretation of Ancient Calendar Data&quot;, etc., and &quot;Explanation of Ancient Astronomical Calendar&quot; (2009). Single line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ny7mraO7Y5GFFm1gNHSi8vPSCMafhQDxWcHj0nBw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;698&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ny7mraO7Y5GFFm1gNHSi8vPSCMafhQDxWcHj0nBw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257548&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Liu Caonan has two works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of his single papers on calendar calculation were published or broadcast during the period when he was teaching at the old Zhejiang University (1942-1952), such as &quot;New Interpretation of &quot;Haidao Arithmetic Classic&quot;, &quot;Nine Chapters of Arithmetic Annotation and Correction of Zu Chong&#39;s Kaili Yuan Shu&quot;, &quot;Annotations and Readings of &quot;Zhou Bi Arithmetic Classic&quot; Pythagorean Square Diagram&quot;, &quot;Nine Number Interpretations of &quot;Zhou Li&quot;, etc. The impact is considerable. But when we were graduate students, the above works were not published. Because this kind of work is an alternative in the Chinese Department, and no one can do it in the History Department, and there is even no journal to publish it. It can be said that there is no way out. Therefore, Mr. Liu is lonely as a master and has no one to understand and understand, so he has no choice but to enjoy himself in the classroom. He often said that I had written an article on this matter and that I had solved that problem, but the impression given to the listeners seemed to be self-promotion, because what he said was really a &quot;book from heaven&quot; that we did not understand at all and had no way to verify, let alone No one responded to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he was qualified to recruit graduate students in multiple directions: pre-Qin and Han literature, ancient science and technology history, and Yuan, Ming and Qing literature and novels. However, it was difficult to recruit students from the pre-Qin and Han Dynasties, and it was impossible for anyone to study the history of science and technology in the Chinese Department, so he decided on the direction of novels. The first class he recruited was Li Mengsheng, and our current class recruited Chen Fei. After studying for three years, under the guidance of Mr. Liu, Chen Fei published a series of papers on Ming and Qing novels, making his debut in the academic world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In class, Mr. Liu also talked about novel research, but as he talked, he began to talk about his unique ideas and methods: rewriting classic novels into popular readers. At that time, he had already co-published a book &quot;The Romance of Wu Song&quot; with Mao Saiyun, with 250,000 words. It was based on the famous &quot;Ten Chapters of Wu&quot; in &quot;Water Margin&quot; and adapted from Hangzhou Pinghua. This book was published by Donghai Literature and Art Publishing House in 1959, with an initial printing of 60,000 copies; in 1980, Zhejiang People&#39;s Publishing House published a revised edition, with an initial printing of 150,000 copies; in 1983, Zhejiang Literature and Art Publishing House republished it, with an initial printing of 300,000 copies. No wonder Mr. Liu believes that this is a new path, and he should follow this path, one by one, and write it into a series, which not only promotes the classics, but also eliminates its dross. In his view, literary creation is the prerequisite for literary research. If you don’t understand creation, you will not be able to do research well. He lamented that he was old and encouraged everyone to attend in class. His words were full of expectations, but no one responded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/maxWYg8ePtn6BMpfBKdxeP0xXPCpgAH4PFnbehcw.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;848&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/maxWYg8ePtn6BMpfBKdxeP0xXPCpgAH4PFnbehcw.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257549&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Different versions of &quot;The Romance of Wu Song&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, I actually didn&#39;t think so, thinking that rewriting ancient vernacular novels had no &quot;academic content&quot;. There must be many people who have the same idea as me. It seems that Chen Fei has not followed suit. Therefore, Mr. Liu can only walk alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I looked at the catalog of the volumes of &quot;The Complete Works of Liu Caonan&quot; and found that &quot;The Romance of Wu Song&quot;, &quot;Shui Bo Liangshan&quot;, &quot;The Green-Faced Beast Yang Zhi&quot; and &quot;Zhuge Liang Comes Out of the Mountain&quot; have been published, and they are all based on classic novels. It was written. In fact, he also had a considerable number of rough works that were not included in the collection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the new century, I visited Japan and found that they had systematically rewritten classic classics. Only then did I truly understand the value and significance of the work advocated by Mr. Liu. It&#39;s a pity that he passed away at the end of the last century, so I can&#39;t apologize to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu not only studies ancient times, but also pays attention to modern and contemporary folk arts. This &quot;going down&quot; approach is currently considered a &quot;new vision&quot; and a &quot;growth point&quot; for future academics. However, there was a &quot;chain of contempt&quot; in &quot;university academics&quot; at that time, and folk literature and rap Literature is at the bottom. However, Mr. Liu was not only engaged in astronomy and calendar, &quot;Confucian classics&quot; and popular literature, so he was unaware of this. He has always maintained a close relationship with storytellers. When we were graduate students, he invited Mr. Tang Gengliang, a famous storyteller, to give a lecture. Unexpectedly, he discovered that I was also in the photo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/n4Yl1LKt0ys3vdGzu7zzQkkVT1kK8VVfReOttdSv.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;472&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/n4Yl1LKt0ys3vdGzu7zzQkkVT1kK8VVfReOttdSv.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257550&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Front row, from left, Liu Caonan, Tang Gengliang, Ping Huishan; back row, from left, Li Jianliang, Zhu Hongda, Huang Shizhong, Chen Fei. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu also has unique insights into the research of &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;. He discovered the value of Chen Qitai&#39;s Tonghuafengge Commentary on &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, wrote a series of essays to introduce it, and compiled the &quot;Collection of Tonghuafengge&#39;s Commentary on &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;&quot; (1981). He also extensively collected Tanci literature and compiled it into &quot;The Opening Collection of Tanci in A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, which was only published after his death (2003), many of which are unique copies. However, these works have not entered the mainstream of research on &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;. He has been involved in novels, operas, and folk arts throughout his life. He can be a family, but he is not outstanding enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/np6fLPOwejqvrR74YxGTVeGjh556GOhL2D1UbgcJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;599&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/np6fLPOwejqvrR74YxGTVeGjh556GOhL2D1UbgcJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257551&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;These two books bring together Mr. Liu’s research on novels and operas, but they will not be published until 2021. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The literature and history of Pre-Qin and Han Dynasties that Mr. Liu devoted the most to. Looking at the list of &quot;Complete Works&quot;, the first volume is &quot;Exploration of &quot;The Book of Songs&quot;&quot;, the second volume is &quot;Textual Interpretation of Chu Ci&quot; and &quot;Collection of Poems&quot;, the third volume is &quot;Collection of Historical Events of the Twelve Princes in the Spring and Autumn Period in &quot;Historical Records&quot;&quot;, and the fourth volume Volumes &quot;Notes on &quot;Gongsun Longzi&quot;&quot; and &quot;Compilation and Research of Chen Hanzhang&#39;s Posthumous Works&quot; and the fifth volume &quot;Literature and History Series&quot;. These works are truly remarkable. However, most of them were not published during his lifetime, and only three volumes have been published so far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Mr. Liu loved poetry and ancient prose since he was a child, and he kept reciting it until his death. He said that he wrote no less than ten thousand poems in his life, but &quot;Poems of Yi Caoxuan&quot; (Xiling Seal Society, 2002) contains only a thousand poems. &quot;Yicaoxuan Wencun&quot; has not yet been published. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His energy is so strong and his research fields are so broad, which really amazed me. The Zhejiang University Press introduced his life when it published the &quot;Complete Works&quot;, saying that he &quot;learned about Chinese and Western liberal arts, comprehensively comprehended hundreds of schools of classics and history, was good at poetry and articles, wrote prolifically, made outstanding achievements, and was famous at home and abroad.&quot; These words are not an exaggeration. . But in fact, even a graduate of this department like me lacks due respect for Mr. Liu. Not long after our graduate students enrolled, Mr. Liu was transferred to the Institute of Ancient Books, and then he recruited graduate students collectively. The previous students had all attended Mr. Liu&#39;s classes, but Fu Jie was the only one who chose Liu Caonan as his second tutor because of his work on the Book of Songs (the first tutors were all Mr. Jiang Liangfu). After graduation, he stayed at the school as Mr. Jiang&#39;s assistant. Fu Jie said that he was actually more influenced by teacher Guo Zaiyi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/mawpbCB7XRZsV5UvSBTLkbmEeNurqKZeah5mldvG.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;481&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/mawpbCB7XRZsV5UvSBTLkbmEeNurqKZeah5mldvG.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257552&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Teachers and students of the Institute of Ancient Books of Hangzhou University in 1986. Mr. Liu is in the front row, second from the right. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1987, the school directly handled the retirement procedures for him without informing him, and Mr. Liu left the teaching profession he loved deeply. post. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was seventy years old and in good health. At that time, most senior liberal arts scholars of this age were still at the forefront of teaching and scientific research, but he probably had no choice but to retire because he was not qualified to be a doctoral supervisor. It seems that Hangzhou University, which has many famous scholars, did not realize his value. Chen Fei gave up the opportunity to stay at Hangzhou University when he graduated. Fu Jie left for Fudan shortly after staying at the university, so Mr. Liu did not leave any academic connections at Hangzhou University. Just before Hangzhou University was merged into Zhejiang University, Mr. Liu passed away due to illness at the age of 82. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In retrospect, in class, he likes to wear a black double-breasted Tang suit or a navy blue Chinese tunic suit, with formal buttons fastened tightly. He has a dark complexion and a pair of black-rimmed glasses on his big nose. , there is always a hint of melancholy in his eyes. He sang &quot;Li Sao&quot; and lamented that Qu Zi was not understood, which was not a personal feeling. At the last moment of his life, he wrote &quot;Two Laws of Writing Tests in the Wuyin Dynasty during the Illness&quot;, the second part goes:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Eighty years of stone and fire have passed, and I am deeply ashamed that my book and sword have been wasted. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The past events in the ancestral hall are forgotten in books, and there are many new things in the school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Who said that Tianguan is not Chinese culture, but he ended up teaching Ye Shituo&#39;s tragedy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are hills left in the chest, and it is nice to hear the sound of jade ke in Zhaoshi. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Who said that Tianguan is not Chinese learning?&quot; is like &quot;a question from heaven&quot;, but no one can answer it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I checked the resume of Mr. Liu Caonan. His nickname was Zhaoxun, his nickname was Bingxian, and his later nickname was Liangxi Kuangsou. Liu Yuanchang was born on December 13, 1917 in Nanmen, Wuxi, Jiangsu. His family was well off. He entered a private school at the age of six and recited &quot;Four Books&quot;, &quot;Mao Shi&quot;, &quot;Shang Shu&quot;, &quot;Zuo Shi Chun Qiu&quot;, etc. After leaving school, he was admitted directly to middle school. He was good at both arts and sciences, and was especially good at mathematics. When he was in the third year of junior high school, he wrote a long paper &quot;Research on Quadrilaterals&quot;, which was published in the graduation commemorative journal of the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1937, he was admitted to the Department of History and Geography of Zhejiang University, but went to Shanghai for some reason. It happened that Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences was recruiting students in Shanghai, so he applied and was admitted to the Department of Civil Engineering, where he studied. In November, the Songhu War broke out, and soon Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese army. The following year, he returned to Zhejiang University and joined the Department of History and Geography. He moved westward with the school and spent three years in Jiande, Zhejiang Province, Ji&#39;an, Jiangxi Province, Yishan, Guangxi Province, and Zunyi, Guizhou Province. When he was in Yishan, he applied to transfer to the newly restored Department of Chinese Literature, but he still studied literature and science concurrently, including earth science, physics, calculus, three biographies of the Spring and Autumn Period, &quot;History&quot;, &quot;Han&quot;, Tang and Song poetry, Courses and books on text exegesis are also included in the elective exposition. He studied astronomy and calculus from Qian Baocong, poetry, literature and history from Miao Yue. He took elective courses such as He Zenglu&#39;s optics, Zhu Tinghu&#39;s earth science, Zhang Yinlin&#39;s history, etc. He studied political science with Fei Gong as his tutor, and he was fluent in both China and the West. The paper &quot;The Moon Has Slowness and the Sun Has Waxing and Shrinking, Also Discussing Chinese and Western Calendar&quot; written when he was in college was praised by Qian Baocong. He graduated from Zunyi in 1942 and stayed at the school to teach. He was the only teaching assistant in the department until 1947. In 1950, he concurrently served as secretary of the Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/BpzJL1MrXfs621UY9ycsgV0WPey3cFZdk4jRjgqd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;496&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/BpzJL1MrXfs621UY9ycsgV0WPey3cFZdk4jRjgqd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257553&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Letter of appointment from Mr. Liu Caonan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1950, the Chinese Academy of Sciences was preparing to compile the &quot;Chinese Science History Data Series&quot;, and Zhu Kezhen, then vice president, wanted to transfer him to Beijing. , the school refused to allow it and the trip failed to take place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years after he stayed in school, the old Zhejiang University’s liberal arts, science and engineering environment made him feel at home. Although wars were frequent, he himself wrote quite a lot, such as &quot;An Examination of the Origin and Origin of &quot;Island Arithmetic Scripture&quot;&quot;, which discussed many differences. Qian Baocong, Li Yan, and Qiu Chongman praised his skills and methods for determining the distance between the sun and the sun. Qiu said: &quot;This is the unfinished work of Yang Hui, Dai Zhen, and Li Huang. How can I compare it with others who play gong?&quot; The happiest period of my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1952, the departments were adjusted and transferred to Zhejiang Normal University (renamed Hangzhou University in 1958). The old astronomical and calendar research was no longer sustainable. Due to work needs, he &quot;switched&quot; to the study of ancient literature, mainly teaching pre-Qin and Han literature. At this time, the teaching and research of ancient literature has required combining Marxist thought to extract the essence and eliminate the dross, and oppose cumbersome textual research. This is a new test for scholars from the old era, and I think Mr. Liu also No exception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1964, Mr. Liu passed the evaluation of the associate professor title and reported it to the Ministry of Education, but it was suspended due to the &quot;Four Clean-ups&quot; and the &quot;Cultural Revolution.&quot; The associate professor certification was restored in 1978. Promoted to professor in 1983. Retired in 1987. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a story in the middle. On October 27, 1964, &quot;A classmate submitted a written opinion to the classical literature teaching and research group, criticizing Mr. Liu Caonan&#39;s teaching of ancient mythology.&quot; The reason was that on September 16, Liu Caonan lectured on the myth of &quot;Gun and Yu&#39;s control of floods&quot;. The new counselor came to listen to the lecture. Under the background of &quot;never forget class struggle&quot;, the matter was upgraded to &quot;class struggle&quot;. the height of. On November 3, &quot;Mr. Liu Caonan examined the &#39;erroneous&#39; views in ancient myths previously discussed.&quot; After that, teacher Xu Shuofang came to the end on behalf of the teaching and research team. Teacher Xu gave a 25-minute speech, which not only affirmed the political sensitivity of the critics, but also supplemented the imperfections of the criticized lectures. The matter was settled. (The above is based on the article &quot;Remembering Xu Gong in Fragments&quot; by He Shengmo, a 1962 student in the Chinese Department). Mr. Liu&#39;s lectures seem to have failed to keep pace with the times, which is evident from this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In today&#39;s terms, Mr. Liu Caonan is actually a &quot;science and engineering man&quot; who has crossed over to the Chinese Department. He is good at mathematics, but fails to gauge people&#39;s hearts; he pays attention to precise details in his work, but is too realistic and does not know how to &quot;fuzzy processing&quot;, which makes him out of place; he has little interest in people, is full of enthusiasm for things, and is often immersed in his own emotions. Among them, I don’t know what night it is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He summarized himself in his later years, saying: &quot;After listening to the teachings of Principal Oufang (Zhu Kezhen), Zhuoru (Qian Baocong), and Yanwei (Miao Yue), I knew that in order to learn, I must learn from Bo Huiyue. . The intersection of Chinese and Western elements, the infiltration of liberal arts and science, and the consideration of textual research, theory, and lyrics. Scholars are not only erudition, interrogation, careful thinking, discernment, and sincere practice; they must also study the laws of natural science and social science in depth, develop things and accomplish things, and enrich the country. Minye.&quot; (&quot;Preface&quot; to the first volume of &quot;Ancient Books and Science&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is indeed a heart-breaking argument. But how can people who work in literature, history and philosophy easily accomplish the task of &quot;crossing over China and the West, infiltrating liberal arts and sciences&quot; and &quot;deeply studying the laws of natural science and social science&quot;? With the tone set so high, listeners may think that he only tailors it for themselves to promote themselves and suppress others, so most of them will sneer in response, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All the sages in ancient times were lonely. But are Mount Tai decadent, beams broken, and philosophers withered? Fortunately, the hills are still left, and all the relics are there. &quot;It sounds good to hear the sound of jade ke in the Zhao Dynasty.&quot; Let future generations comment on it! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 10 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[未知终点的旅程]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259939]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/EaRWMUN5AGUC2ypEysvTSFIS8MlEbOKbtYzI0WYd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/EaRWMUN5AGUC2ypEysvTSFIS8MlEbOKbtYzI 0WYd. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Artist Ding Yi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Li Xiaoliang/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For abstract artists, there is an ultimate proposition that may run through the entire career, that is: after having formed their own iconic illustrations, how to &quot;effectively Repeat yourself”? In other words, how to use similar icons again and again but always give them new meaning, creating ever-changing combinations based on the language that you form? The answer varies from person to person. On this path, many abstract masters have left their own answers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same problem also poses to curators. For those prolific artists who hold large-scale solo exhibitions every year, how to find new context and angles in their curatorial ideas? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/l3qk2aavAUz7VlNfWCywRgzAGscaxX7VjL7yPpi9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/l3qk2aavAUz7VlNfWCywRgzAGscaxX7VjL7yPpi9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256538&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Yi’s solo exhibition &quot;Hometown and Journey&quot; attempts to answer these propositions. This is also the first time that Ding Yi has returned to his hometown to hold a large-scale solo exhibition in his more than 30-year artistic career. The first stop of the exhibition is the Ningbo Art Museum. The art museum is located at the dockside of Ningbo’s Old Bund, and is where this port city opened hundreds of years ago. years of testimony. Ding Yi was born in Shanghai, but when he was a child, he often returned to his ancestral home, Ningbo. The Western-style Shanghai points to a rich external world, while Ningbo, which is also a port, points to the depths of history and culture. This is the inclusiveness of Shanghai-style civilization. The etiquette and customs of his hometown such as New Year celebrations, social operas, weddings and funerals, etc., still impress him to this day. What was particularly unforgettable was that he took a night boat from Shanghai back to Ningbo every week and sailed on the water all night. In addition to the fishing fires, the starlight in the sky was refracted on the sparkling water - he later saw this mapping relationship countless times, whether in Looking up at the stars in the sky from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, or looking down at the city lights on the ground while flying, the world and the sky share the same abstract and bright patterns, all of which enter into his paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/xwMZCcL9MXVq4fDdtWbe7zHkfaIBbrZxuSh17RGI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;485&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/xwMZCcL9MXVq4fDdtWbe7zHkfaIBbrZxuSh17RGI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256544&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ding Yi, &quot;Signs of Crosses 2023-B3&quot;, 2023, mineral pigment, toner, charcoal, pencil, acrylic on rice paper, 350cm×720cm&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Ding Yi Studio/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The exhibition itself is like a journey. Besides Ningbo Art Museum, Huamao Art Education Museum serves as the second stop of the exhibition. Echoing this kind of artistic context combing with travel as a clue. Because of his work, Ding Yi often travels around the world and maintains the habit of painting along the way. &quot;In recent years, I have traveled to many countries and regions, and I feel that they are the birthplaces of ancient human civilization, such as Egypt and Greece. , India, Arabia, Africa, etc., have all experienced glorious and prosperous periods and are part of the world as a whole, so I incorporate these travels into my creative thinking.&quot; - These small works on paper are like graphic versions of Diary: Barcelona is the mottled brown, red and black colors on the vellum paper, Athens is the solemn temple columns on the golden coast, Istanbul is the shadowy acupuncture geometric patterns in the pure white, Cairo is the pyramids under the blazing sun, Alxa is There are layers of gold-plated Gobi yellow sand, and Osaka is filled with various shades of green... Ding Yi still uses his usual cross pattern, but his obsession with &quot;fighting against painterliness&quot; has long since disappeared. In fact, when facing Ding Yi&#39;s original works, what one feels is the richness of painting. Different media and techniques make this exploration more and more in-depth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/xKUsWPz6S5sEifm8nIBYV3wGdFFGaxuInMMuIPdB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;528&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/xKUsWPz6S5sEifm8nIBYV3wGdFFGaxuInMMuIPdB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256539&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Exhibition view of Huamao Art Education Museum&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The migration and flow of people may be one of the biggest changes in the times in the past 30 years.

Five years later, Ding Yi’s works participated in the 45th Venice Biennale, the First Asia-Pacific Art Triennial and the Chinese Avant-Garde Art Exhibition, officially beginning the internationalization of Chinese contemporary artists. After that, &quot;Cross&quot;&#39;s footprints spread all over the world. These works traveled across the ocean, were displayed and seen, and became a carrier of cultural and memory exchanges. Ding Yi&#39;s important early works are densely marked: Berlin, Birmingham, Bilbao, Bologna, Rotterdam... It seems that this painting has acquired a deeper personality due to frequent travels.

In the past few days, the &quot;low-price agreement&quot; controversy in the live broadcast room has arisen again and again. From the lead anchor Li Jiaqi being accused of &quot;choosing one of the two&quot;, to Brother Yang angrily criticizing Li Jiaqi for &quot;price monopoly&quot;, and then Brother Dayang&#39;s company was revealed to have a price guarantee agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a time, the &quot;minimum price agreement&quot; hidden behind the leading anchors was put on the table, and a storm of public opinion about price and law began. An industry insider told reporters from Nandu and N Video, &quot;In the past few years, anchors would clarify the content of the &#39;minimum price agreement&#39;, but now they may find ways to avoid this expression, such as &#39;This price must be the maximum discount given by the brand.&#39;&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, on October 30, Hangzhou issued the &quot;Livestreaming E-commerce Industry Compliance Guidelines (Draft for Comments)&quot; which clarified that livestreaming e-commerce practitioners must not require merchants to sign a &quot;minimum price agreement.&quot; . Zheng Ning, director of the Law Department of the School of Cultural Industry Management of Communication University of China, told Nandu reporters that this is a &quot;Guideline&quot; issued at the local level and has no mandatory legal effect. It may not be applicable to other regions, but it can serve as a leading example for the whole country. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Reduced Price Controversy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the end of October, a salesperson posted on WeChat Moments that Li Jiaqi was suspected of &quot;choosing one of the two.&quot; It stated that it received a lawyer&#39;s letter from the brand owner Hai&#39;s. The brand complained that because the price of a certain Hai&#39;s oven on the platform was lower than the price of Li Jiaqi&#39;s live broadcast, it violated the &quot;reservoir price agreement&quot; signed between them and Li Jiaqi and required huge liquidated damages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Hai&#39;s issued a statement stating that it had not signed any &quot;reserve price agreement&quot; with the channel mentioned by the sales staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Nandu reporters asked the relevant person in charge of Li Jiaqi’s operator Meizhi (Shanghai) Network Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Meizhi Company&quot;), the other party did not respond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company’s official website competition and compliance announcement states that “Meijia strictly adheres to the principles of equality, voluntariness, fairness, honesty and credit, and fully respects the independent business rights of merchants.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And that’s it. Not long ago, a &quot;post-90s&quot; investment specialist of Meizhi Company took advantage of his position to provide merchants with help in product selection and live broadcast scheduling, and collected over one million yuan in benefits. He was found guilty of bribery by non-state personnel and position-related crimes. Crime of embezzlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 4, Meishi Company issued a statement stating that the labor contract had been terminated and that there was no green channel for the investment promotion and product selection process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters noticed that on the same day that the sales staff shouted to Li Jiaqi, e-commerce anchor Dayang Ge angrily criticized Li Jiaqi for price control in the &quot;Crazy Little Yang Ge&quot; live broadcast room, &quot;How much lower are we than Li Jiaqi?&quot; , then nothing can be sold, he can build a platform by himself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09 /a7abe56dd7eedceb164fef353547f911.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;609&quot; height=&quot;950&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /09/a7abe56dd7eedceb164fef353547f911.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257719&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Brother Yang said Li Jiaqi controls prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is intriguing is that not long after Brother Yang angrily criticized Li Jiaqi, it was revealed that the live broadcast room of &quot;Crazy Little Brother Yang&quot; had an insured contract, and &quot;the amount of compensation stipulated in the event of breach of contract is 1 million yuan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Supply Chain&quot; column of the official website of Hefei Sanguangyang Network Technology Co., Ltd., the company to which &quot;Crazy Little Yang&quot; belongs, points out the requirement for &quot;price control&quot;, that is, &quot;the whole network has the same price&quot; We control the price of each product to ensure that the live broadcast room is truly cost-effective.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One wave has not subsided, but another wave has arisen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, netizens discovered that Simba’s Douyin account had been banned. According to people familiar with the matter, &quot;Simba has repeatedly published false information on Douyin, insulted and abused, and provoked wars.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters noticed that in a previous live broadcast on Douyin, Simba once said &quot;I don&#39;t care about your platform, nor your traffic.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/7720cb332ccc203bee21691c08866cd6 .jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;518&quot; height=&quot;839&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09 /7720cb332ccc203bee21691c08866cd6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257718&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Simba’s Douyin account has been banned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is reported that Simba sold a Mousse mattress originally priced at more than 20,000 yuan for 4,980 yuan in a previous live broadcast, bringing more than 1 billion in goods to Mousse live broadcast. This caused dissatisfaction among many offline dealers of Mousse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before his account was banned, Simba angrily shouted in the Douyin live broadcast room, &quot;Can you please stop messing with me? I, Xin Youzhi, don&#39;t have the ability to monopolize an industry.&quot; &quot;No matter how much I sell, It doesn’t matter to you, my customers are not your users, and Mousse mattresses are not allowed to be taken off the shelves before the 31st.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a time, a storm of public opinion surrounding the live broadcast e-commerce industry was unfolding. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Monopoly suspicion&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“The floor price agreement definitely exists.” On November 4, Mr. Li, a brand manager in the cosmetics industry, told Nandu reporters &quot;In the past few years, it would have been written very clearly. Now anchors may find ways to avoid this expression. For example, &#39;this price must be the maximum discount given by the brand&#39;, which means the same thing as &#39;minimum price agreement&#39;, but The way of expression is different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the brand violates the &#39;minimum price agreement&#39;, the anchor may not necessarily file a lawsuit with the brand, but he may not help the brand bring goods, or may not do so in the future. Cooperation.&quot; Mr. Li believes that this kind of loss is unbearable for the brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is reported that the day after the sales staff shouted out Li Jiaqi, the person in charge of home appliances and furniture of an e-commerce platform posted in Moments, &quot;Some top anchors deprive consumers of their enjoyment for their own selfish interests. It’s really a chaos of low-price rights, and we must resist the overbearing clauses of ‘low-price agreements’ across the entire network.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Does the “low-price agreement” signed between the anchor and the brand involve a violation of the “Anti-Monopoly Law” Behavior? Ding Maozhong, director of the Competition Law Research Center of Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, told Nandu reporters that this requires standardized analysis. Judging from the identification standards of the Anti-Monopoly Law, a clear conclusion cannot yet be given. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Monopoly agreements are divided into horizontal monopoly agreements and vertical monopoly agreements. The prerequisite for a horizontal monopoly agreement is that there is a competitive relationship between operators, and there is no competitive relationship between the anchor and the brand.&quot; Ding Maozhong explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that the vertical monopoly agreement mainly depends on whether it has a dominant market position and whether there is abuse of market dominance. &quot;This requires a series of normative analyses. For example, the prerequisite for abusing a dominant market position is that the operator must have a dominant market position. Judging from the current situation, it cannot be concluded whether the anchor violates the Anti-Monopoly Law.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;So, what is &quot;choose one&quot; behavior? Ding Maozhong explained that this is an abuse of market dominance to restrict transactions. &quot;First of all, the operator must have a dominant market position. Secondly, the operator, without legitimate reasons, restricts the transaction counterparty to only trade with it or only with its designated operator, which constitutes the so-called &#39;choose one of the two&#39;. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for whether Li Jiaqi is involved in &quot;choosing one of the two,&quot; Ding Maozhong said that this also requires a standardized analysis based on specific factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Development Prospects&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Whether it is a &quot;lower price agreement&quot; or a &quot;choose one&quot;, it is actually a battle between anchors about the &quot;lowest price&quot; scramble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/84b59e1f2611a479a79830ddb24b44af.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;384&quot; height=&quot;610&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/84b59e1f2611a479a79830ddb24b44af.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257720&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The head anchor Li Jiaqi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Li, the brand manager of the cosmetics industry, believes that excessive pursuit of “minimizing” prices is not a good thing for brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The anchor keeps the brand&#39;s price to the lowest, and the brand may think about how to reduce production costs simultaneously, and the quality will also decrease relatively. And this is a fatal blow to the innovation of the company.&quot; He said, Enterprises no longer aim at product upgrades, but are forced to find cheaper production methods, which is actually a step back for the development of enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, the anchor is seeking benefits for consumers by requiring merchants to sign a &quot;lower price agreement.&quot; In fact, the &quot;lowest price on the entire network&quot; serves as a trump card for anchors to attract consumers and promotes the popularity of live broadcast rooms. It not only increases the influence of anchors, but can even further increase their live broadcast commissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The increase in the profits of anchors selling goods also eats up the development space of brands. In the long run, the industry cannot sustain healthy development, low-priced products will eventually disappear, and consumers will have to pay for new high-priced products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the “lowest prices” that can be seen everywhere in the live broadcast room, who sets the price of the product? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Maozhong introduced that live broadcast pricing does not deviate from the legal framework. The Price Law divides pricing into two categories: one is market independent pricing, and the other is regulated by the government. Among the products promoted and sold by anchors, products that do not fall within the scope of government guidance or pricing are all market-adjusted prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Price Law&quot; stipulates that in principle, sales at a loss, price gouging and other behaviors that seriously disrupt the market order cannot be carried out.

Carrying twins for Xiong was Hong Huanhuan&#39;s first job since she was transferred to a new job as a nanny, with a monthly salary of 6,500 yuan. In the opinion of a colleague named Hu, the salary of this job is not high. According to the market price in Wuhan, it costs 6,000-8,000 yuan for a nanny to take care of a child who is not in kindergarten. &quot;Generally, two aunts take care of twins.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the job transfer, Hong Huanhuan&#39;s position was as a domestic agent. Former colleague Gao Xuemei explained to a reporter from Southern Weekend that in a housekeeping company, an agent&#39;s income mainly depends on personal performance. &quot;The more orders you sign, the more you get.&quot; In the past few years due to the epidemic, some domestic workers have had a heavy financial burden and have chosen to change careers. The wages of domestic agents have also dropped from seven to eight thousand yuan per month to at most four to five thousand yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Huanhuan’s husband Wu Qiang works on the assembly line of an electronics factory in Wuhan, and his father-in-law has a pension. My father-in-law passed away due to illness in 2021. My 70-year-old mother-in-law has underlying diseases and has to take care of their two children who are in school in their hometown in Hanchuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I didn&#39;t make much money in the past few years, so my sister said I needed a stable job.&quot; Hong Mingxuan explained the reason why Hong Huanhuan became a childcare nanny. His wife is the general manager of Wuhan Auntie Housekeeping Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Mingxuan and Hong Huanhuan grew up together. He recalled that after graduating from junior high school, his sister first went to work in Guangdong and then went to Zhangjiakou to set up a stall. In 2018, she returned to Wuhan to work as a housekeeper to be closer to the children and to take care of the elderly. During this period, she took the nanny qualification certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Xuemei recalled that the two met in October 2022 after Hong Huanhuan moved into the household. Hong Huanhuan said that she and Xiong took care of the baby together. She took the baby to bed at night, and the child&#39;s grandfather was responsible for doing housework. Hong Huanhuan mentioned that her clients love to keep their homes clean. Although she does not need to do most of the hygiene, she will help with cleaning and washing baby clothes as long as she has time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Huanhuan told Gao Xuemei at that time, &quot;Bao&#39;s mother (Xiong) may not be in a good mood sometimes, and sometimes she will curse&quot; and sometimes lose her temper at her , and when he is good to her, he is very nice. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I broke my client’s child’s bone after falling”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the child’s accident on the slide, Xiong’s short video account had more than a dozen There has been no update for days. On October 16, she sang in a new video, &quot;The happiness I envy is always not available, and the people I love who love me are not taken care of.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned merchant recalled that previously, Xiong and Hong Huanhuan often took their two children for walks in and around the community garden. One day in early October, she once saw Xiong with a red face, as if he had drunk alcohol. As he walked, he scolded Hong Huanhuan behind him for being &quot;too cruel.&quot; In the next few days, Hong Huanhuan came to her store to pick up the express delivery, and she found that he &quot;was not looking very well.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to rumors, Xiong asked Hong Huanhuan to compensate Hong Huanhuan 100,000 yuan after his child was injured while playing on the slide. Hong Mingxuan confirmed this amount to Southern Weekend reporters. The second sisters of Hong Mingxuan, Gao Xuemei and Wu Qiang said that after the incident, Hong Huanhuan borrowed money from them or people around her on WeChat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In October, the winter jujubes in Gao Xuemei&#39;s hometown were ripe. She sent Hong Huanhuan a WeChat message: &quot;Huanhuan, give me your home address and send the jujubes to you.&quot; At around 11 o&#39;clock in the evening on October 12, Hong Huanhuan replied: &quot;Don&#39;t send it, I&#39;m not in the mood to eat it. I broke the customer&#39;s child&#39;s leg.&quot; Gao Xuemei asked, but Hong Huanhuan did not reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 20, Gao Xuemei received a text message from Hong Huanhuan: &quot;Dear, do you have any money? Can you lend me 10,000 yuan?&quot; She replied: &quot;Huanhuan, I&#39;m sorry, my mother was diagnosed with cancer two months ago. She is undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy this month, and may need an operation. I really don&#39;t have much money to give you.&quot; Hong Huanhuan told her: &quot;It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;ve pretty much taken care of it here. I caused you trouble.&quot; This was their last contact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Qiang’s second sister said that a few days before the incident, Hong Huanhuan also borrowed money from Wu Qiang’s eldest sister. The eldest sister handed over the money without saying anything. Afterwards, the eldest sister talked to her about the hurried video call and recalled that Hong Huanhuan wore a mask the whole time at Xiong&#39;s house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Qiang’s second sister later calculated that since October, Wu Qiang and his relatives and friends had given Hong Huanhuan a total of 61,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Mingxuan also lent money to his sister. He said he didn&#39;t ask much at the time. After all, the child was injured and it was understandable that his sister needed to compensate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Mingxuan said that before joining the household in 2022, Hong Huanhuan was diagnosed with gallstones and other indicators were normal, but he did not provide the corresponding physical examination report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They don’t know why Hong Huanhuan died suddenly. Many neighbors interviewed said that they did not pay attention to the family&#39;s movements. Only the camera installed by Wang Yifei in the corridor recorded some of the family&#39;s comings and goings on October 21 and 22. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At 8:35, 10:26 and 17:32 on the 21st, Xiong, Hong Huanhuan and a middle-aged woman with short hair took two The children came in and out of the house three times. Among them, the short-haired woman was always carrying a girl, Xiong was pushing a car with a boy in it, and Hong Huanhuan was wearing gray short-sleeves and gray trousers. Hong Huanhuan wore a mask when she went out twice. When she appeared in front of the camera, she did not take her children with her. She always carried handbags, vegetables or garbage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73363&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70175&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/10/e26d751080.jpeg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG3199.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;In surveillance video, Xiong Lan (left) and Hong Huanhuan (right) walked out of the elevator entrance on October 21, 2023.

At this time, Xiong went out with the stretcher, then stood outside the door and looked into the house. There was also a man standing in the house. This man had not appeared in the video before, and neighbors and Hong Huanhuan&#39;s relatives said they did not recognize the man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The surveillance video 10 seconds later showed that the door of Xiong’s home was closed and all the emergency personnel were standing in the elevator. Xiong had an extra green coat on his left hand, and holding three plastic bags in his right hand, he also squeezed into the elevator from the corridor. A male voice asked: &quot;She was a little confused before?&quot; The female voice replied: &quot;Yes, yes, yes.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Hong Mingxuan, after being sent to the hospital on the 22nd , the housekeeping company received a call from Xiong, saying that Hong Huanhuan &quot;fainted&quot; at home. The housekeeping company immediately notified Hong Huanhuan&#39;s family and sent people to the hospital. Hong Mingxuan said that he was relatively close to the hospital at the time and was the first to arrive. The housekeeping company, Hong Huanhuan&#39;s parents, husband and other relatives and friends arrived one after another. &quot;It turned out that my sister was no longer here.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was close to noon when Hong Mingxuan arrived. Hong Huanhuan had already received rescue measures in the hospital for about an hour and a half. &quot;The employer insisted on sending her to the hospital for rescue.&quot; He did not provide Hong Huanhuan&#39;s death certificate to Southern Weekend reporters, which usually indicates the time of death. He explained that since the police have opened a case for investigation, the hospital has not issued a death certificate to the family members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Surveillance video shows that Xiong returned home at 10:58 and 13:30 on the day Hong Huanhuan was sent to the hospital.

Hong Mingxuan said that except for the meeting with Xiong at the police station on the 22nd, he had never seen him again. &quot;There was no explanation of the situation and no apology.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 25, staff from the Houhu Police Station of the Jiangan District Branch of the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau told the media that the police had filed a case and the suspect had been controlled. The details of the case The whole story is still under investigation. On November 7, staff from Houhu Police Station told Southern Weekend reporters that they would not comment on the case for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;I haven’t seen my family for five months&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Huanhuan’s colleague Zhang Lijia said that the housekeeping company bought insurance for every aunt who came to the household. If an aunt encounters an accident when she comes to work, such as being injured or damaging the employer&#39;s property, she should inform the housekeeper and the insurance company within 24 hours, and the claim settlement process can be started. &quot;Every aunt will undergo training in this area.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Huanhuan has been working as a housekeeping agent since 2018, and is familiar with how to deal with accidents when domestic workers come to the household. &quot;I can&#39;t figure out why it was only a few days later that Bao&#39;s mother notified the company that something happened to her child,&quot; Zhang Lijia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When they were agents, Hong Huanhuan and Zhang Lijia lived together in the attic of the office for more than a year.

But after Hong Huanhuan moved into the household, the two of them had fewer opportunities to meet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 24, Zhang Lijia sent Hong Huanhuan a WeChat message and asked her what she was doing, but Hong Huanhuan did not reply. Zhang Lijia thought she was just busy. &quot;When the crayfish came out (in summer), I asked her if she wanted to go out to eat together. She said that she probably didn&#39;t have time recently. Let&#39;s eat together when the hairy crabs come out (in autumn and winter).&quot; When Zhang Lijia contacted Hong Huanhuan in the summer of 2023, the other party said this She agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Huanhuan likes to shoot short videos, recording her daily life with family gatherings, going to the beach with colleagues, and taking her children out to play.

Wu Qiang&#39;s mother recalled that in the 15 years since their marriage, she had never seen her son and daughter-in-law have a word with each other.

Wu Qiang previously rented a room near his workplace in Wuhan, which was not close to Yintai Yuhuayuan, but Hong Huanhuan would go there every time he was on vacation.
