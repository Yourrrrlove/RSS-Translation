At 19:00 on October 5, Beijing time, the winner was announced, Can Xue lost. But this does not mean that the odds have no reference value. In fact, Norwegian writer Jon Fother ranks second after Can Xue on this odds list. Unlike Gurner, the 2021 winner, Fauser is not an unpopular choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the more than 100-year history of the Nobel Prize for Literature, only 17 female writers have won the prize, and 8 of them won the prize in the 21st century, including the American female poet Glück in 2020 and French female writer Ernault in 2022. Undoubtedly, the Swedish Academy, which has been questioned by public opinion, is turning its attention more and more to outstanding female authors. Therefore, Can Xue still has a good chance of winning this award in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The citation for the award was &quot;for his innovative plays and essays that give voice to the ineffable&quot;. Fosse&#39;s award &quot;quite reasonably follows the tradition of the Nobel Prize in Literature not forgetting outstanding playwrights, from Maeterlinck, Shaw, and Beckett to Dario Foe, Pinter, and Handke. It is quite brilliant. Even more convincing than the list of novelists,&quot; poet and critic Liao Weitang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eon Fosse is one of the most famous figures in contemporary theater and a popular candidate for the Nobel Prize in recent years. His works also cover poetry, novels, essays, children&#39;s literature and translations. Fother&#39;s plays have been staged thousands of times around the world, including &quot;The Girl on the Sofa&quot; in China in 2004 and &quot;One Summer&quot; produced by the Shanghai Dramatic Art Center. Fosse once watched his own play &quot;Somebody&#39;s Coming&quot; in Shanghai and felt that it was one of the best stage presentations of his work in the world, and he developed a respect for Chinese drama and Chinese culture. Fother&#39;s honors include the Scandinavian National Theater Award (2002), the Norwegian Arts Council Honor Award (2003), the Swedish Academy&#39;s Nordic Prize (2007), and the International Ibsen Prize (2010). ). The work &quot;New Title: Heptata 6-7&quot; was shortlisted for the 2022 International Booker Prize. Anders Olsen, chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature, said his works &quot;touch upon your deepest feelings, anxieties, insecurities, questions of life and death.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse was born in Haugesund on the west coast of Norway on September 29, 1959. He began his creative career at the age of twelve, which he calls &quot;ashamingly early&quot;. Fosse loved to play guitar and at one time was in a rock band. Translator Zou Lulu believes that &quot;his early musical experience brought a unique Fother-like color and style to his later writing - a strong sense of rhythm and musicality in his dramatic language.&quot; Since the late 1970s, Fosse has lived in Bergen, Norway&#39;s second largest city and the country&#39;s cultural capital. In recent years, he has also gone to southern France and Austrian towns on the outskirts of Vienna to write. Fosse is very energetic and often starts writing at four or five o&#39;clock in the afternoon and works until nine o&#39;clock the next morning. When asked if he had any advice for writing, he said: &quot;Write, don&#39;t think! Think before you write, think after you finish, but don&#39;t think about anything while writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About En Fauser&#39;s earliest reading memory is a small book. In the book, a major felt that his town needed a fire truck, and then he and some citizens built it. It looked more like what children built out of wood. Car. “I used wood to build cars when I was a kid,” Fosse said. He admired Trakl, Kafka and Beckett, and at the same time, Beckett was an important object of &quot;resistance&quot; when he wrote dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse uses a rare language, &quot;New Norwegian&quot;. Even in Norway, which has a population of only more than five million, its speakers only account for one-tenth of the total population. Fortunately, New Norwegian can be easily understood by Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish speakers. But it is with the help of translation that Fosse&#39;s works are known to more readers. Currently, his books have been translated into more than forty languages. At first, he only wanted to write poems and novels. In 1993, he was invited to write his first script because he was short of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are John Fother&#39;s drama selections &quot;Somebody&#39;s Coming&quot; and &quot;Autumn Dreams&quot; published by Shanghai Translation Publishing House. Wenjing is about to publish &quot;Trilogy&quot;, one of Fosse&#39;s masterpiece novels. This work won the Nordic Council Literary Award in 2015 and demonstrates his cold, solemn and concise epic style. The novel contains three closely connected parts: &quot;Awakening&quot;, &quot;Olav&#39;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Tiredness&quot;. The story begins with the young lovers Asle and Alida leaving their hometown for Björgven (the city of Bergen). Alida is about to give birth, but the couple has difficulty finding a place to live. They later found a place to live and gave birth to a son, Sigvald, who began to adopt different names, Olav and Åsta. But someone recognized Asler, and it was very clear that Asler and Alida seemed to be carrying murder cases, although Asler might have acted out of helplessness. Asler was eventually hanged. In the last part, the story time advances to the life of Asler and Alida&#39;s daughter Ales. By this time Ales is already an old woman. She recalls her sister who died young and herself. His brother Sigvald left him when he was young...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wan, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Trilogy&quot;, is a young writer and translator. In her opinion, John Fother&#39;s After the work was introduced to China, it has not attracted widespread attention from readers, and even senior readers rarely know about him. &quot;Fosse is not an issue-oriented writer. He has very consistently inherited the Nordic expressionist drama tradition. His language is concise and full of tension. His profound depiction of the character&#39;s spirit and his analysis of the relationship between people have reached a very high level. He will not write about trivial daily life, but pay attention to people&#39;s mental state.&quot; Li Wan told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The protagonist of Fosse&#39;s work is somewhat similar to himself. He is an alcoholic. He has some mental problems and has many extreme fringe experiences. He faces his own heart very directly and exposes himself. He is a writer who can share with others the most helpless side of a person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;With this, At the same time, Jon Fother has developed a unique style of writing. Periods are rarely used. A sentence is often very, very long. He uses many commas to connect it, giving people the feeling that the inner monologue is constantly rolling forward. This may not be the case. Due to the sensitivity of a playwright, he brings dramatic elements into the novel. In addition, he will use some repetitive sentences in different parts of the novel, but this repetition is not exactly the same, but changes with the changing context and the change of words. Subtle changes produce variations and variations, bringing a rhythm that is cyclical and constantly advancing,&quot; Li Wan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 11:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被上司“甩锅”怎么办？当首先秉直做好自己的分内事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258030]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Complaining about your boss in the workplace is a long-lasting and endless &quot;program&quot;. Regarding the question &quot;What is the most shameless sentence you have ever heard from a manager?&quot;, some netizens&#39; answers resonated: A subordinate proposed a plan, and the leader said it was no good and must be modified according to his wishes. The subordinate insisted, and the leader was angry, &quot;Listen to me. That’s fine.” There was a problem with the implementation of the leader&#39;s revised plan. The leader went to his subordinates and said, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you insist on it in the first place? You should insist on what you think is right. You have to find a way to convince me. You have no opinion at all.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;Why don&#39;t you persuade me properly?&quot; In essence, this sentence represents a kind of shirk of responsibility. Isn&#39;t there a saying, &quot;The merit is for oneself, the fault is for others&quot;, which refers to this kind of person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of leader is indeed the kind that easily arouses public anger. It is clear that his subordinates have opinions but their opinions are &quot;beaten to death&quot;, and they still say that others have no opinions, which is simply a hooliganism. But it’s not too weird, because he at least hinted that the subordinate’s original plan was correct, and it is extremely difficult for a leader to admit this. Leaders who do things like this are really rare nowadays. Leaders who shirk responsibility will not do it so obviously and without skills, because it is impossible to sit in this position with such a simple and crude IQ. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A situation a little more &quot;shameless&quot; than this was mentioned by a netizen: Under normal circumstances, the leader will tell you that you have messed up such a good plan of mine, how to implement it? of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This sentence really impressed me. Yes, some leaders have this tone and taste. They are &quot;always reasonable&quot; in front of their subordinates. But this is not the best of &quot;pass-and-pass leadership&quot;. The real best is that he never says what his plan is, he just asks you to implement it, and then keeps making changes. Such leaders are either unpredictable and disdainful of mediocre plans, or they are extremely poor and like to &quot;hide their clumsiness&quot; while using their subordinates as &quot;guinea pigs&quot; for plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latter situation is not uncommon in reality. To put it bluntly, some people get into important management positions without knowing how, and then start a happy life of being guided by laypeople. To be honest, I&#39;m most afraid of this. If a lay leader values ​​your talent and ability and therefore chooses to respect your plan, that&#39;s not bad. The worst thing is that he doesn&#39;t know how to pretend to understand and is stubborn and uses a lot of jokes to explain &quot; Management wisdom&quot; to force subordinates to &quot;obey&quot;. When I was young, I encountered bosses who would always say, &quot;You just need to be obedient.&quot; Ninety-nine percent of those who advocate &quot;obedience and learning&quot; are ambitious and talented bosses who love to pretend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively speaking, a leader who is &quot;overbearing&quot; but can handle things and take responsibility is much better. Those leaders who want to show leadership authority but have no structure are just &quot;dwarf&quot; leaders. The reason why they dare not take responsibility or take responsibility is because of selfishness and face. They do not have the courage to admit that they are inferior to their subordinates and are jealous of their talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that management is an art. There is nothing wrong with this, but one thing should be added: management must first be about human touch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What follows is what should subordinates do in the face of the aforementioned leaders who love to shirk their responsibilities? In other words, where is the boundary of responsibility between superiors and subordinates in the workplace? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any unit, superiors and subordinates are the &quot;community of goals&quot;. Considering that most units adopt a project responsibility system, superiors and subordinates should be of one mind, be capable, and be wise. Out of wisdom, in short, judging by talent. But in reality, this kind of situation is rare. In many cases, the game and internal friction between superiors and subordinates fill the time and space of a unit, which is suffocating and sighing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, although the &quot;pass-through leader&quot; bears the greatest responsibility, is there no way for subordinates to reflect on it? it&#39;s not true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a unit, there are always the most &quot;honest people&quot;. They often just want to do things well and get paid on time. But if everything went so smoothly, there would be no such thing as &quot;workplace troubles.&quot; The biggest confusion a dutiful employee encounters is being blamed by his boss or even making things difficult for him. In this kind of environment, no matter what you do, it won&#39;t be satisfactory. Just looking at the leader&#39;s face every day is enough. In this regard, many people&#39;s bad emotions inevitably accumulate in their hearts, and there seems to be no other way except to find reliable people to complain about from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it’s useless to complain behind your back. If the leader can’t hear it, won’t it end up being scattered in the wind? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as a subordinate, after encountering a strange leader, you are not just helpless and let others &quot;abuse&quot; you, but you can deal with it according to the actual situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a matter or a plan, if subordinates are not assigned responsibilities and bear the final consequences, it goes without saying that under normal circumstances, just listen to the leader. If you have a responsibility, it is your duty to do it well. If you do not do it well, you will bear the final consequences. Even if the leader puts forward opinions, they can only be used as a reference. If something is wrong, you will not blindly follow it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;ultimate person in charge&quot; of this matter is your boss, and you are just an executor, then when you encounter the leader making an obvious mistake, you can do it in two situations. The first is to persuade when necessary, state the interests and harms, and let the leader hear the correct point of view. As for whether the leader adopts it or not, the decision lies with the leader; the second is that if the leader is stubborn, he will not only be unable to listen to different opinions, but will even put forward opinions. If the behavior is not tolerated, then it would be uninteresting to stay in such a department. Instead of being blamed and taking the blame for a long time, it is better to consider changing departments - which is equivalent to changing the leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Persuading leaders is indeed risky. In the workplace, there are leaders who like to put small shoes on those who give opinions, but if you are a decent subordinate, why would you dare not to give opinions? Are you just worried about what your boss will think of you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, when I was a middle-level cadre in a company, I often gave advice to my superiors, even arguing. Sometimes, my opinions are adopted, for example, to protect employees in my department from being punished indiscriminately; sometimes, my opinions are ignored, such as when the leader handles things unfairly in the elimination of the last place, resulting in people who should not leave. Being &quot;eliminated&quot; but refusing to correct his mistakes. This kind of nest had too much to worry about, and I felt uncomfortable. After careful consideration, I chose to leave. Although I lost some visible &quot;benefits&quot; as a result, I won the respect and understanding of those who knew me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final analysis, if a subordinate wants to have a good relationship with his superiors in work and life, and coordinate various affairs well, it is the basic principle to be neither humble nor arrogant, and to stick to the bottom line. Without this principle, the relationship between the two parties will inevitably be distorted. A person with a strong sense of right and wrong cannot really change the adverse effects caused by insisting on the correct position, nor can he be as &quot;well-rounded&quot; as some people, but he should still insist on being an upright and outspoken person. Otherwise, even if we have achieved &quot;maximization of interests&quot;, we have lost our bottom line and character. Can we still have a clear conscience? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[尹学芸：故乡是一枚爱人丨月是故乡明⑥]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257348]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 10:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 09/04/73f60a5ff76ba4f9050678f79d1cf516.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/21/09/04/73f60a5ff76ba4f9050678f79d1cf516.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;159101&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Reading Yin Xueyun&#39;s &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot; for the first time, readers may feel a little confused. His novels always &quot;talk right from the beginning, without any pretense&quot;, like green seedlings growing in the ground, simple and pretty, with a fresh earthy smell. A writer who is used to writing about villages, counties, officialdom, and wine shops, How did you come up with the idea of ​​writing an urban romance novel that looks like flowers in the fog? The 2021 novel collection of the same name includes several novellas such as &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot;, &quot;Wanghu Tower&quot;, &quot;Feeding the Ghosts&quot;, &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; and &quot;Faster Than the Wind&quot;. Continue reading, this &quot;strange&quot; novel The origins of the story are gradually revealed, and a Yin Xueyun familiar to old readers slowly emerges. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The origin of Yin Xueyun’s writing is Jizhou in the northernmost part of Tianjin City&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (formerly known as Ji County before 2016) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. There is an artificial lake in the small town, which was once an important water source for Tianjin. In the past, people often fished, took boats, and swam in the lake, but in order to protect the water source, these projects were canceled and many buildings around the lake were demolished one by one. She walked along the lake when she had nothing to do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot; tells the story of two women, Xue Xiaoli and Su Mei, and a young man who went to an abandoned manor to search for her in &quot;pairs&quot; several times. The story of a reclusive master. The novel originated from an encounter with Yin Xueyun himself. During a stroll, she walked into an abandoned manor and saw different flowers and plants inside, as well as swings, a sports field, a fish pond, and a lake-view pavilion. The old luxury was clearly visible, and she even saw something familiar to her. man&#39;s inscription. There used to be many well-decorated sanatoriums in the small town. They were built by various departments in places close to mountains and rivers. It was difficult for ordinary people to enter, and they were later demolished. Such a manor could be hidden in the small Jizhou, and even the locals would find it difficult to find it. She guessed that this garden was also one of those sanatoriums. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ec25f82eb0ee551da14bf69a97e2a8f0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ec25f82eb0ee551da14bf69a97e2a8f0.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159102&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are only a few scenes in the small town. One scene can be looked back and forth, guessed, and used. This secret manor has been written by Yin Xueyun in &quot;Wanghu Tower&quot; and &quot;Looking for the Lake&quot;. Hidden people are not seen&quot;. When it is prosperous, the garden is the Wanghu Tower where retired workers from the county town spend all their money to treat guests to a meal; when it is desolate, the garden has become an elusive place for veteran cadres who are walking in official steps with their hands behind their backs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It seems to be her writing instinct to repeatedly salvage, wash and chew her own life without wasting a grain of inspiration. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8ded87050634cf1d3cb1a36b522a0991.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8ded87050634cf1d3cb1a36b522a0991.png&quot; data-key= &quot;159097&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;From Hancun to Xuncheng&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;Jizhou is the only semi-mountainous area in Tianjin. It is high in the north and low in the south. Mountains, plains, large depressions and reservoir areas gather here. The earliest history can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period. There is a poem in the Ming Dynasty that goes: &quot;When you come to the west to reach the end of the mountains, you will see the city of Jizhou.&quot; Life in the mountainous areas rarely changes, and people are not good at adapting. The characters in Yin Xueyun&#39;s works all have a persistent background. Color: Sisters Li Xun and Li Quan who persisted in love and pursued light in the war-torn years in &quot;The Wind and Dust&quot;, Feng Nuo who persisted in searching for her missing friend despite opposition in &quot;The Ballad of Cai Gen&quot;, and firmly believed in the power of the apple tree in &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; Suspicious Liu Ping... Some historians told Yin Xueyun that when the Qing army entered the Pass, the people of Ji County refused to surrender until death, and were massacred three times. The character of the people here was to be cruel, sluggish, and twisted. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Jizhou is a place where obsession arises, and Yin Xueyun’s literature is also the fruit of persistence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some people went to visit Yin Xueyun’s village after reading her works, but were disappointed to find that the river was not that clear, the streets were not that long, and there were not always cows braying when entering the village. and fried grasshoppers. Yin Xueyun has actually seen these beauties, but the rare village she writes about is neither a peach blossom garden nor a foreign land where strange legends are born, but a place of life, with all kinds of villagers passing through, providing three meals a day. Running around and calculating, the relationships between people are intricate and intricate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;To be precise, the village where Yin Xueyun was born and raised is in the lowest depression in southern Jizhou, surrounded by water on three sides, with only one road on the south side. The &quot;Uncle Li Hai&quot; who won her the Lu Xun Literature Prize followed this road every year and came to &quot;my&quot; house empty-handed, bringing the family a glory that only existed in their imagination, and then loaded up with everything they had cobbled together. Food and supplies go back. The friendship that never returned lasted for more than 20 years and finally overdrawn. The family kept a secret about Uncle Li Hai. Only then did &quot;I&quot; know about the humiliating life history of my uncle. He did not live in an urban community with gardens and high-rise buildings, but in a remote place. In the barren Kuli Valley, the family is extremely poor, and several members of the family wait for Uncle Li Hai to bring flour from &quot;my&quot; house every year to make dumplings for the New Year. The two families looked up to each other and secretly compared each other to get through the difficult period. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When Yin Xueyun was a child, the days in the village moved at an almost solid speed. The only changes were who died and who got married. Some people wear the same clothes in winter and summer, but they take out the cotton wool in summer and stuff it in in winter. The village is nicknamed &quot;Nagging Village&quot; because there are many people who are not doing their job properly and enjoy good food and drink. Meat that cannot be sold in other villages will be sold here. Her parents are both farmers, and there is no one around her who is involved in writing work. She looked for the source of her literary genes, which was her grandfather who could read scripts, sing operas, and shout trumpets. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many writers remember their reading history. She also wrote down in her notebook: &quot;Wild Fire and Spring Wind Fighting in the Ancient City&quot;, &quot;Fighting Youth&quot;, &quot;Golden Avenue&quot;...from elementary school She had memorized 147 titles of books she read from first grade to junior high school graduation. This number made her wonder if she had remembered it wrong. But in her words, these books are all about war, which may not be very nutritious for literature. When she was a teenager, she didn’t even know there were magazines in the world, let alone come into contact with foreign literature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Even so, you must read, read one book at a time, and come out bit by bit. Because of scarcity, the memory of books is strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is not easy for rural children to get access to books, and sometimes they have to &quot;match wits and courage&quot; with their brothers and sisters. When she was a child, her sister, who was seven years older than her, loved reading and would often bring books to the house but would not read them to her. Once my sister hid a book that was said to be &quot;not suitable for children&quot;. She turned the house upside down and finally found it in an old cotton shoe. When she took the book out, she only smelled the smell of feet. When she was not at home, she took it out and read it, stuffed it back after reading it, and secretly finished reading the book about &quot;sexual intercourse&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (later she found out it was &quot;Song of Youth&quot; 》)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/7f8bae790b16dddbf271186d99de917a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/7f8bae790b16dddbf271186d99de917a.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159107&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When she was not at school, she was reading a book while herding sheep. There was a lamb beside her and a copy of &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot; without a book cover on her lap. The book was written in traditional Chinese characters. , she couldn’t understand it at all, but she could still remember the plot of “Second Sister You swallowed her own gold and died by herself”, and the stories in the book took root in her mind. On the way to school in the town, she walked in the wheat field with the children in the village. The children rushed to her side. She held a spindle in her hand and spun the cotton randomly pulled from the cotton field into thread, while talking about Mix books and memories with imagination to make a story, and tell it to your friends. She began to dream that one day her writing would be turned into type. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After graduating from high school, Yin Xueyun went to work as a seamstress in a village-run garment factory. As long as she had a day off, she would go to the county town and buy ten magazines and read them all night long. She also started to contribute articles to publications after work. At the beginning, she didn&#39;t pay attention to the differences between different publications. She couldn&#39;t remember the names of the writers she read, didn&#39;t understand anything, and her manuscripts were rejected many times. Sometimes, the editor criticized her in the rejection letter for imitating a certain writer. She was confused and didn&#39;t know who the writer she was &quot;imitating&quot; was. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At heart, she is still a farmer who relies on the weather. If it rains too much, the seedlings will grow wildly, and if there is a severe drought, there will be no harvest. The same is true for writing. There is no chance of winning awards or becoming famous. My ambition is to work step by step and write whatever comes to my mind. During this period, she relied on her innate spirituality and affection to write about life in the countryside and the ecology of the countryside, expressing those around her who were &quot;thinking of ways to live&quot;. She published publications ranging from &quot;Jixian Literature and Art&quot; to &quot;Tianjin Literature&quot; &quot;Tianjin Daily&quot;, the efforts are slowly paying off. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the late 1980s, Yin Xueyun’s novel &quot;A Woman Called Suyue&quot; was adapted into a TV series and broadcast on CCTV. The background music of this TV series was composed of a song called &quot; Yin Xueyun was deeply moved by the sound of Xun&#39;s musical instrument and decided to use &quot;Xun&quot; to name the cities in her future works. From then on, &quot;Xun City&quot; became another literary landmark of hers. At that time, she was helping the county write county chronicles. Due to the influence of CCTV, the county party committee specially gave her a quota, and she was directly transferred from a temporary worker to a national cadre. Speaking of this, Yin Xueyun couldn&#39;t help but sigh: &quot;Literature changes destiny, it is really literature that changes destiny.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/21/09/04/48d2bb4bfb153e940de848008ae8bbf9.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;从农民转变成了干部，尹学芸辗转文化馆、旅游局、住建委等多个不同的部门，工作让她接触了形形色色的人，她拉开一段距离，观察人在工作中怎么思考、行动，有什么样的关系需要协调，写出了一个个入木三分的基层干部形象。早些年，还有单位的人警告她，别把自己写成小说，她暗自反问：“哪个单独的人物能构成一篇小说？”她喜欢将人物放到时间的长河里冲刷，洗掉他们一时的意气风发和灰头土脸，留下平时幽微却又真实的人性，再为他们编织一个故事的框。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;和乡村不一样的是，机关把人分出了很多层面，领导和非领导、年龄大的和年龄小的，甚至身后的背景都会有人刻意衡量和揣测，在单位里，人总要面对很多不同的人，处理很多不同的关系，在这样复杂又温吞的日常生活里，她拓展着人灵魂自省的深度。 《士别十年》&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（2015年发表）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;是一个典型的人性在机关工作里蜕变的故事，这本小说很早就开始写，中间被搁置在电脑里长达十年，十年的时间，让“看事物总是一厢情愿，见不得任何形式主义，眼里容不得一粒沙子”的文艺女青年郭缨子，学会了察言观色、收敛锋芒，成了办公室里八面玲珑、酒局上左右逢源的主任，与当初的缨子处境极像的陈丹果不堪领导骚扰和同事孤立，跳楼自杀，陈丹果的死让缨子意识到自己已沉沦为帮凶，也向读者提出一个发人深省的追问：世俗的成功是否以丧失常识和常态生活为代价？这部小说引起了很多人的共鸣，并获得百花文学奖的认可。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;小说问世之前，尹学芸在文学上也经历了一段“温水煮青蛙”的时间。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;她对名利一直不敏感。用她的话来说，偏远山区的作者远离了都市，也就远离了名利场，所以人一直是潜在深水里的状态，想漂浮都难。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;90年代之后，尹学芸给人的印象是写作停顿了几年。那时她年纪尚轻，时不时发表点小说、散文，办着一份小刊物，和相识的作者到处赏花、打牌、野餐，每天乐乐呵呵的。但很快她感到疲乏。虽然一直有作品发出来，但常联系的刊物只有几家，小说在一个小圈子里撞来撞去，没有向上的动力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;走出了山洼，年岁渐长之后，她想到了以前没想过的事情。 “你生活在一个山高皇帝远的地方，好处是自己比较自由，坏处也是自己比较自由，没人督促你。后来认识河北那些作家，特别羡慕人家有这样一个三五个人的小团体，写东西知道好在哪、不好在哪。但那时候我在有的地方发了也没人看见，也没人告诉你应该怎么走。”尹学芸说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;好在，基层作家之间的善意“接住”了她。在她小说写得不温不火时，有经验的作家给她指路——去更生活化、读者更多的晚报发表。于是她开始为晚报写小说，也写散文、随笔，内容更加丰富了，侃足球、忆乡村、拉家常，什么都写。那段时间，她天天傍晚去登山，一边登山一边琢磨写作，“有的时候一串题材在后面排队，总有很多可写的东西，就是这样一种感觉，让你觉得生活就是很有意思的。”尹学芸形容。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;报纸的专栏发稿量大，一次要发好几篇，她想到了写自己生活的乡村中慢慢消失的词语。眼看着城镇化不断加速，农村一些具有历史意义和地方色彩的场景变得面目模糊。乡民走入城市，存于50到70年代之间的许多方言词汇退出人们的交流，有相当一部分在80年代初即已成历史。为了不让这些词语悄无声息地消失，她走遍了县境里大大小小的村庄，从本地人口中挖来那些字词。有些词传播的地域广阔，有些词在南方和北方、古代和现代的用法不一样，有的口音难以用文字模拟，遇到难以把握的部分，她也跟天南海北的网友讨论。这段在田垄上的寻访经历，留下了诸如“开圈”&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（队里把地里的白薯、花生或小麦都收完了，允许社员们去刨遗留下的白薯、花生或拣拾残留在地上的麦穗）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;、“新宿”&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（偶尔借宿在别人家里）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;、“看青”&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（在庄稼即将成熟、由绿转黄的时候看守庄稼，防止别人偷粮食）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;等百个乡村词语的记录，后来成书为《慢慢消失的乡村词语》&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（2009年出版）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;写了几年散文、专栏，她逐渐找到了自己写作的感觉，整个城市的百姓也知道了她。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/c460ca9c53226d3823b9f98c2f0cb4c8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;2014年对尹学芸来说是个特殊的年份，她发了五部中篇小说，写出了《李海叔叔》和《士别十年》，进入了作品的井喷期。直到现在，她和这几部作品的命运仍然让她唏嘘。当时一部中篇小说《玲珑塔》被退稿，她怎么也想不明白退稿的原因，就把稿子给了《收获》杂志，编辑不到一周就打电话来提出了修改意见。等待终审的那几个月她什么也没干，不知道自己是怎么过来的。她对自己说，终审过了再开始写，终审不过以后就不写了。那年她50岁，到了女干部离岗的年龄，如果稿子没有给《收获》、没有过审，她也许会换一个活法。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;终审还是过了，《收获》发表《玲珑塔》后，陆续有编辑找尹学芸约稿。她第一个写的就是《李海叔叔》，但因为版面的问题一直搁置。她又把另一篇稿子拿给编辑提意见，被对方要走发表，这篇就是《士别十年》。 “我老跟那些作家朋友说，不用着急，自己慢慢写，你自己有机会，作品有机会，来了就来了。有的时候反正你找也找不到，这又不是一部作品就怎么样的时代。”尹学芸说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;第二年尹学芸继续发力，发了10部中篇，到2016年发了14部。她至今都觉得那段时间的生产力是不可思议的。 “虽然说那个时候都已经不是创作力最好的时候了，但是你会觉得文学突然给你打开了一扇窗，你可以抓住这样一个机会，其实那个时候没有任何人告诉你应该怎么样，但是自己真是有这种感觉。”她说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ef2d03ef4a1659a5a7086bcd87ce3563.png&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;离开故乡30年后，她写了一篇名字骇人的《喂鬼》，小说的主人公云丫为躲避故乡的干娘临终前指派她在葬礼上为其“喂鬼”的仪式，急匆匆与网友阿祥相约远赴云南旅行。一路上却不断接到来自干娘的大儿子的催促和央告，令她心神不安。结果旅行结束返回埙城，她还是按照干娘的遗愿去喂鬼，才知道喂鬼只是一个很简单的佛教法事&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（“喂鬼”也叫“放焰口”，其实就是赈济鬼魂，给予法食令其饱满。）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。三个多月后，云丫接到电话，她的朋友阿祥已在三个月前死于一场车祸。这是一场徒劳的出走。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;尹学芸谈起这篇小说的创作时说：“很多时候故乡就是一枚爱人，有时候让你想着法地逃离，可更多的时候，又让你想着法地回归。有对比才有反差，有反差才有不同情感方式的表达。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;尽管作为基层工作者，尹学芸还是需要经常跟乡村打交道，但已经不是小时候那种生活在其中的状态，而是客居。年龄大了，和乡村的距离也在拉大，她和家乡的那些人、事之间有了一层越来越碍眼的隔膜。过去她喜欢把熟悉的人反复用在多部作品里，刻画人物不同的侧面，把故事写得满满当当，但现在她的生活里已经很难找到这样的人。在《寻隐者不遇》中，现代人的神龙见首不见尾，人与人之间感情的淡薄、疏远，通过大量留白表现出来。再也找不到《李海叔叔》里那种长达二十多年的精神连接。 “再然后你就发现，其实你跟所有的故乡、所有的乡村都是隔膜的，其实变化的不是它们，是你自己，很多时候都是你的眼睛变了，或者你的心也变了，我回去得越来越少了，跟他们的交往越来越少了。”尹学芸说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;作为以乡村题材见长的作家，她不得不对这种隔膜警惕起来：“作品中的那种温度其实都在退，那种底色都在褪。我觉得是作家的通病，可能隔一段就得反思，怎么在生活中找到切口，这是很重要的。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（参考资料：《尹学芸印象》《尹学芸：没有哪段生活是白费的》《尹学芸：我曾被这盏灯照亮也期待它照亮更多人》《专访」尹学芸：最基层的作者离文坛很遥远，发再多小说也不是著名作家》《尹学芸：乡村的秩序》，感谢译林出版社和邓郁为采访提供的帮助）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如今，这两家仓储会员店不仅可以满足消费者的购物需求，也可以满足他们凑热闹、看八卦的需求，因为8月以来，山姆与盒马的“小学生打架”就没有停止过。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高端的商战，往往采用最朴素的方式，那就是我的商品比你低1元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此前，山姆与盒马为一块榴莲千层蛋糕“打”得不可开交——榴莲千层最先由山姆热卖，一块128元，盒马直接标价一块99元。山姆不服输，把榴莲千层的价格打到88元，盒马降到86元，山姆就调到85元，几个回合下来，蛋糕价格一度降至79元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;随后，从月饼西瓜到鸡蛋小零食都卷入这场商战，很多人疑惑，山姆与盒马为何要“小学生打架”？价格战能让他们顺利地圈到中产消费者吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;巨头们各有烦恼&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;正当传统商超经营普遍陷入困境时，带有批发性质的仓储会员商店发展得如火如荼。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;仓储会员店走的量贩售卖模式，大包装、品类多、价格优惠，消费者每隔一段时间才去大采购一次。艾媒咨询数据显示，2021年仓储会员超市行业市场规模达304.3亿元，2022年市场规模达335亿元，预计到2025年有望接近400亿元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;作为中国仓储会员商店的头部品牌，山姆会员店和盒马X店各有风光，也各有烦恼，不得不铆足劲头竞争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆会员店已成为沃尔玛业绩中重要的增长点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;根据沃尔玛第二季度的数据，第二季度总营收为1616亿美元，同比增长5.7%或5.4%（受汇率影响），营业利润同比增长5亿美元，增长率为6.7%。其中，沃尔玛中国净销售额为41亿美元，同比增长21.7%，仓储会员业务与电商业务增长亮眼。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆会员店坐稳国内仓储会员店的头把交椅。一方面，1996年，山姆就在深圳开了中国第一家仓储会员店，将仓储会员的模式与理念传输到国内。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;另一方面，作为世界500强常年的第一名，沃尔玛在全球范围内建立了庞大、稳固的供应链体系，沃尔玛旗下的山姆会员店能够以更低的价格拿到更高品质的商品，并让利给消费者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆会员店1983年就在美国开了第一家店，至今已经有40年历史，它的积淀与经验是其他仓储会员店一时半会还难以比拟的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;然而，山姆也有烦恼，那就是模仿者、竞争者甚至是“碰瓷者”太多了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;同样诞生于美国的Costco，主打仓储会员模式，是山姆的老对手，麦德龙、家乐福等国外品牌也穷追不舍，至于国内，诚如永辉、盒马等来势汹汹，尤其是后起之秀的盒马X店，已经渐渐对山姆形成严峻挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;对于成立于2015年的盒马来说，历史尽管不长，走过的弯路也不少，除了招牌的盒马鲜生以外，盒马此前推出的盒马小站、盒马MINI、盒马集市和盒马邻里等，大都已经铩羽而归。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;目前盒马形成三个比较稳定的业务，一个是盒马鲜生，一个是盒马奥莱店（折扣店），另外一个就是仓储会员模式的盒马X店。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;今年，阿里巴巴启动“1+6+N”组织变革，盒马只是“N”中的一部分，在集团中的地位有所下滑，盒马还是阿里最有希望上市的业务之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如果只是盒马鲜生盈利肯定是不够的，所以，X店成为盒马的重中之重，被寄予厚望。除了赶紧多开店外，更是要抢占市场份额，提升盈利能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;瞄准中产，抢占中产&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;仓储会员店的目标客户，是中国新兴的中产阶层。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆会员店早在1996年就在中国大陆开了第一家，不过，截至2016年，整整20年时间也仅只有16家店。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;伴随着中国中产阶层的迅速崛起，山姆会员店才迎来爆发式增长，从2017年至今6年不到的时间，山姆会员店已经新增了29家店，目前大陆已经有45家山姆会员店，预计到今年底将达到48家。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;仓储会员店的中产属性，另一个标志是它并不便宜的年费。比如山姆普通会员费为260元，盒马X黄金会员年费为258元。值得注意的是，会员费的期限只有一年，并且不能抵现。换句话说，得先花260元才能进入山姆消费，哪怕你一年在山姆什么也没买，260元也是不能返还的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;会员费门槛自然阻隔了很大一部分消费者，无疑也会提高付费消费者的购物黏性，办了这里的会员卡，当然会来这里高频购物，才不会浪费了会员费。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;凭借强大的供应链和议价能力，仓储会员店也会努力以“物美又全、价格合理”的商品，让消费者的260元的会员费花得不亏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆与盒马对准的都是具有较好的经济基础、对生活品质有高追求的中产尤其是中产家庭，二者的用户高度重合。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据月狐iAPP所示，山姆与盒马的用户重合率达到43.1%。而今年2月，沃尔玛中国区CEO朱晓静在一场内部讲话中表示，山姆唯一竞争对手可能就是盒马。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这一次也是盒马率先发起针对山姆的“价格战”，盒马的畅销活动叫“移山价”，一语双关，既是愚公移山，也是要移走山姆。这名称，“小学生打架”的意味蛮浓。搞笑的是，美团也一度加入战局，推出的价格叫“拔河价”，这“河”，不正是“盒马”吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;谁能“打赢”这群架&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在这场仓储会员领域的群架中，谁能“打赢”？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;单靠价格战，并不是最优解。既因为不可持续，也因为价格战只针对少数的商品品类，并非全线都比对方低价。更关键的是，中产在意的并不是那一两块钱的差距，很多人愿意花贵一点的价格购买更优品质的商品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;所以，仓储会员商店还是得回到根本上来：“物美又全，价格合理”——这考验的仍然是供应链的强度与韧性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;能否在全球范围内，以更低的价格采买优质的产品？从采购到上架，需要多长时间？如何确保货柜上的热门商品能够源源不断提供？消费者网上采购，能够以多快的速度送货上门？能否不断提供爆款的自营产品？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;它们都与供应链有关。在这一点上，山姆与Costco布局多年、树大根深，确实需要盒马不断追赶。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;作为本土品牌，盒马的优势是带有更加鲜明的“本土化”特色，更加契合国人的一些消费需求。比如中国正步入单身社会，单身的中产越来越多，山姆会员店那种超大量的贩卖模式不适合这些单身中产，盒马的X会员店，就很注重经营小包装商品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;中国的电商经济高度发达，盒马背靠阿里健全成熟的物流体系，送货上门的速度极快，反之，Costco不久前才推出到家配送服务，真的是姗姗来迟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;再比如，下沉市场仍是仓储会员商店未充分开发的领地，盒马主打折扣商品和临期商品的奥莱店，可以在一线城市扎根，在下沉市场也有很大的想象空间……&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆、盒马等仓储会员店该如何扬长避短，好戏还在后头。无论如何，它们充分竞争是好事一件，帮消费者把价格打下来，消费者还能顺便看看八卦，何乐不为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 10:26:35 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子诬告强奸在新加坡被判入狱：世界性难题如何破解？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258118]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;一起发生在国外的案件引发关注。综合新加坡《联合早报》《海峡时报》报道，中国籍女子张露恬（22岁）10月2日在法庭上认罪，承认自己向公务员提供虚假资料。法官最终判其入狱五周。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;案件并不复杂：当事女子2021年4月通过社交软件与男子刘栋扬结识，一个月后见面并在当年8月确立恋爱关系，之后又在刘栋扬处同居。 2022年3月9日，两人在刘栋扬住处发生激烈争吵，当事女子在午夜00：38报警。面对到场调查的十名警员、五名调查人员和四名法证人员，当事女子称自己遭遇刘栋扬虐待，也曾三次遭遇后者强奸，并向医务人员重复了指控。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘栋扬一共被问话44分钟，两部手机与护照也遭警方扣留。然而在报案一个月后，当事女子就改口承认自己撒谎，并且撤回了虚假指控。 “为的就是要让男方惹上麻烦。”当事女子还透露自己早在事发约一周后就尝试销案，但是并未成功。检察官Kevin Liew表示，被告提供假信息浪费了公共资源，也冤枉一名无辜的受害者，因此提议法官判被告坐牢至少六周。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对检方的指控，当事女子哽咽发表辩词称，事发时自己刚满21岁，认知能力尚不成熟，一时冲动才犯下错误。除了对受害者外，自己行为并未对公众利益造成巨大伤害。当时因遭前男友粗暴对待，急着寻求帮助才会谎称遭到对方强奸。她已追悔莫及也得到了前男友原谅，希望法官从轻发落。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这起案件已经尘埃落定，法官确实也如当事女子所愿对其“从轻发落”，将刑期从六到十个星期变成了五个星期。不过，这起案件仍有一些未发之覆，值得深入辨析与评论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，案件本身显示当事女子的说辞存在矛盾之处，其辩词并不能服人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当事女子所谓“认知偏差”的辩称透露着一股黑色幽默，特别是那句“对法律条款的认知能力不足，对于自身犯罪的严重性认知也非常不成熟”。那么，既然她“认知能力尚不成熟”，为何却以强奸罪指控男友？要知道，强奸罪在新加坡可是最高刑期20年同时最多鞭刑12下的重罪。因此，当事女子的言行似乎只能解读为她对强奸罪罪名的后果有所认知，却不足以认知诬告他人的法律后果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，“认知偏差”的话术也常见于国内强奸或性侵诬告者在露馅之后的自辩。在喧腾一时的“罗冠军案”中，梁颖就声称“她本人对强奸罪法律定义的认知出现偏差，才会在网上冤枉罗冠军”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诬告者自辩“认知偏差”，其实是无法自圆其说的。从梁颖发动的“小作文”舆论攻势与本案中当事女子的司法攻势来看，诬告者对于公开指控“强奸罪”的后果其实有着清晰的认知，目的就是“把对方弄到社会性死亡”“给对方惹麻烦”。而在其它案例里，诬告者还有“把你送进监狱”这样直白的威胁。难道诬告者不知道“强奸罪”的严重性？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不难想见诬告者的心路历程：公开指控对方性侵或强奸，最好的结果是逼迫对方让出利益或者让自己吃到流量红利，乃至真的将对方送进监狱，至少毁掉对方的人生；最坏的结果也不过是“自己记错了”，以类似“认知偏差”的理由为诬告行为开脱，“可攻可守”的状态，足以让自己立于不败之地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也正是如此，当事女子才在耗费大量公共资源、诬告已经实锤之后，以“认知偏差”辩称诬告之举，借助“心智不成熟”企图脱逃报假案之罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，本案也显示“性侵或强奸诬告”是个全球性难题，诬告者需要承担的举证责任、所需承担的民事与刑事责任，均与诬告成功的可能获利严重不成比例。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在本案中，当事女子最终的罪名只是“向公务员提供虚假信息罪”，检察官在指控中也只是强调了其“浪费大量公共资源”的行径。根据新加坡《刑事法典》第177条，向公务员提供虚假信息者将被处以最高六个月的刑期，或者并处罚金5000新元。然而，对比当事女子的诬告之举，以及一旦罪名成立之后男方所面临的的严厉刑责，这是严重不符比例原则的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果类似诬告行为总能实现“零成本高回报”，而且即便报了假案作了伪证也只是坐牢六个星期的话，那么其所带来的“制度激励”仍将制造更多的诬告案件，从长远来看同样会伤害公共利益。难道，社会只能在“默许乃至宽纵诬告”与“保障真正受害者敢于报案”之间或此或彼？这又是一个“虚假两难推理”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其三，被诬告者也未能站出来伸张自己的权益，控告对方的犯罪行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新加坡法律没有诬告陷害罪，但有诽谤罪。根据新加坡《刑事法典》第499条，如果发现足够的证据，警察可以采取行动逮捕诽谤的罪犯。受害者也可以选择根据《诽谤法》提起民事诉讼，或向警方报案进行刑事起诉，如能证明诽谤者有意图、知道或有理由相信他的话会损害受害者的名誉，即可发起控告，挽回自己被侵权的损失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在本案中，当事女子诽谤的事证确凿，而且不无作伪证的嫌疑。其对当事男子的直接伤害是数十分钟的问话、护照手机被扣以及人格名誉的损害，潜在可能的伤害更是“有期徒刑加鞭刑套餐”的重刑。然而当事男子并没有反诉女方，而是“就此原谅”。实际上，这增加了公共利益受损的风险。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以新加坡麻醉科医生杨绍南为例，他在遭遇一名女子的性侵诬告之后四年（2017-2021）才得以洗脱冤屈，但冗长的法律程序让他丢了公立医院的职位，付出了巨额经济损失，承受了名誉的毁灭性打击，最终打赢官司也是于事无补，控方至今也未对女子提供虚假证据作出任何行动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上早在2021年9月13日，新加坡国会就有议员联合提案说，在制定新的法律增加对性侵罪刑罚的同时，也要寻求对那些遭遇错误指控者的保护。加强对诬告受害者的保护，首先就需要加大对诬告犯罪者的打击，鼓励受害者站出来反诉，不能再让性侵诬告变成一种“低成本高收益”的游戏，让“认知偏差”成为诬告者脱罪减罪的捷径。诚如杨绍南医生在真相大白之后表示：法律制度应当能对滥用法律的人施加足够的威慑力，同时不会阻止真正遭受性犯罪的受害者勇敢地站出来。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;新国标的实施可以推动厂商专注于月饼本身的创新、取缔过于精美繁复的包装，但目前仍然存在部分商家“钻空子”的行为，需要相关部门加强监管。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个中秋国庆长假有多少人的早餐被月饼承包？又有多少人注意到家中堆积如山的月饼礼盒正在发生哪些变化？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你手边正好有月饼礼盒，不妨做个小测验：打开礼盒，除了月饼是否还配备刀叉、盘子或其他产品？从月饼所在的包装袋向外数，能不能数出四层？如果得到肯定的答案，那么眼前的月饼极有可能因“过度包装”违反国家相关标准。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该标准为国家市场监管总局（国家标准委）修订发布的《限制商品过度包装要求食品和化妆品》（GB 23350—2021），于2023年9月1日正式实施。该标准第1号修改单从包装空隙率、包装层数、包装成本、混装要求四个方面进一步提出限制月饼过度包装的规定，已于2022年8月15日实施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据第1号修改单，月饼不应与其他产品混装，包装不应超过三层。销售价格在100元以上的月饼，包装成本占销售价格的比例不得超过15%。同时包装材料不得使用贵金属、红木等贵重材料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一年过渡期后，月饼是否依旧存在过度包装现象？南方周末记者随机抽样调查了电商平台的月饼礼盒商品，发现混装现象最为突出，也有一部分商家在商品描述上玩花样，规避相对严格的月饼管理标准。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北京市海淀区计量检测所工程师张梦娇向南方周末记者表示，月饼作为中秋传统食物，引人联想的画面是家人团聚而不是精美包装，尽管月饼具有一定的社交属性，但收礼者也希望月饼能够物有所值，新国标的实施可以推动厂商专注于月饼本身的创新、取缔过于精美繁复的包装，但目前仍然存在部分商家“钻空子”的行为，需要相关部门加强监管。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;月饼混装的重灾区：文创和联名礼盒&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;月饼礼盒包含塑料刀叉，曾是广式月饼的“常规操作”，禁止混装的新规出台后，除去用于保护月饼的食品用脱氧剂、冰袋，包括刀叉在内的所有产品都不被允许出现在月饼礼盒中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者调查发现，2023年的月饼市场上仍然存在不少混装产品，文创和联名礼盒的混装现象最为突出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如，知名食品品牌稻香村推出小兔顺耳IP联名款月饼礼盒，礼盒中包含稻香村月饼馅料包和DIY模具，并提供了制作月饼的教程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/E1WdzWFPUkXj7ZwQcnixLf2EV21LWNEuScV5Wsyn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;774&quot; height=&quot;1313&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/E1WdzWFPUkXj7ZwQcnixLf2EV21LWNEuScV5Wsyn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253061&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月5日，稻香村联合陈小桃推出月饼礼盒，混装DIY模具。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（天猫稻香村旗舰店/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;部分餐饮品牌也推出混装礼盒，并屡探500元上限。 2022年6月，国家发改委、市场监管总局等四部门联合发布《关于遏制“天价”月饼、促进行业健康发展的公告》，提出对单价超过500元的盒装月饼实行重点监管。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高端连锁品牌大董和宋代院体细笔绘画研究学者刘庆杨联名推出“董之月·礼享集”月饼礼盒，礼盒包含七款月饼和一幅挂画，标价468元（优惠后398元）。产品种类下设两种选项，虽然名为“月饼馅种类”，但大董电商客服告诉南方周末记者，两款礼盒的月饼种类一致，区别在于收到的画作是《百种牡丹谱》还是《梧桐双月兔》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了食品品牌，部分文创定制商家也在试探着月饼过度包装的底线。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如，淘宝平台上一家主营节日定制伴手礼的店铺推出的中秋礼盒分为不同组合的套餐，套餐内标配2粒百草味月饼，消费者还可以自主选择香薰片、乌龙茶、香水、贺卡等内容物进行多元化混装。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/Jv26GpQJVUDfv0enJJsYaviqmYY7zHPae3MGK6Dl.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;北京市海淀区市场监督管理局标准化科魏彦丹向南方周末记者表示，在我国境内生产、销售和进口的所有食品（含散装食品）和化妆品的销售包装均适用于《限制商品过度包装要求食品和化妆品》（GB 23350—2021）。南方周末记者查询发现，根据第1号修改单，月饼、粽子的包装要求更为严格，除月饼、粽子外，对其他食品和化妆品并未做出混装限制。这意味着，糕点、巧克力等食品虽然适用新国标的限制过度包装要求，但仍然可以与其他产品混装。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按照现行的月饼推荐性国家标准（GB/T 19855-2015），月饼的定义为使用小麦粉等谷物粉或植物粉、油、糖（或不加糖）等为主要原料制成饼皮，包裹各种馅料，经加工而成，在中秋节食用为主的传统节日食品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这种情况下，如果实际判断为其它糕点，但按月饼售卖，那么可能存在实物与描述不符的情况，需要进一步确认其售卖食品与其标签是否标注一致。”张梦娇表示，通常，预包装食品标签上的品名、执行标准、食品生产许可证编号等，均可作为判断依据，或由主管部门综合判断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者发现，还有一类商家在商品描述中故意模糊月饼和糕点的概念，将“真月饼”伪装成糕点，试图规避新国标对月饼混装的要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北京市海淀区市场监督管理局标准化科魏彦丹告诉南方周末记者，根据《中华人民共和国标准化法》第二十七条的规定，“企业应当按照标准组织生产经营活动，其生产的产品、提供的服务应当符合企业公开标准的技术要求。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;如何判断月饼是否过度包装？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“以《蟾宫玉兔图》为灵感，礼盒采用前后镂空图案，放入灯饰装饰，如揽明月入怀”，这段介绍来自一款以新中式包装为亮点、包含“高档”“送礼”等关键词的月饼礼盒，该产品标价358元，在电商平台吸引了上百人购买，评论区里不乏“外包装好看”的买家推荐语。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为普通消费者，又该如何判断购买的月饼过度包装呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据《限制商品过度包装要求食品和化妆品》（GB 23350—2021）国家标准第1号修改单，判断月饼是否存在过度包装可以从四个指标着手：包装层数、包装成本、混装以及包装空隙率。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/BRKT4wkwzvaCnYeTBKnzwGGG0TXpskpIyXjuWqgw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1039&quot; height=&quot;1503&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/BRKT4wkwzvaCnYeTBKnzwGGG0TXpskpIyXjuWqgw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“如果是敞口的手提袋、固定内装物或包装物的半托、包装盒外的腰封，不符合完全包裹的定义，都不能算作一层。而抽屉式包装，哪怕有两层抽屉，也只计入一层包装。对于包装精美复杂但层数符合要求的创意月饼包装，可以进一步判断包装成本是否违规。”张梦娇说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;包装空隙率根据月饼的净含量计算得出，月饼单件净含量越大，标准规定的空隙率越小，单件净含量大于50g的月饼，空隙率必须≤30%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张梦娇表示，由于计算方法较为复杂，包装空隙率一般由技术机构在实验室对抽检样品进行检测。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海市市场监督管理局向南方周末记者表示，自2023年8月以来，上海市市场监督管理局对本市市场销售的月饼开展了过度包装监督抽查，涉及超市、连锁面包房、酒店等52家生产经营单位，共抽查月饼80批次，月饼包装违规的主因是包装空隙率不合格。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IPG中国首席经济学家柏文喜告诉南方周末记者，打击过度包装有助于降低消费者购买成本，提高购物体验，也能减少消费者购买高价月饼的行为，从而降低社会浪费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者从上海市市场监管局获悉，消费者可以使用上海市市场监管局开发的微信小程序“包装有度”，通过输入商品包装简单信息，只需1分钟时间即能初步判定商品是否涉嫌过度包装。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“异域星球”墨石公园丨指尖华夏⑦]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257593]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;墨石公园位于四川省甘孜州道孚八美镇卡玛村与中古村交界处，面积&lt;span>;5&lt;/span>;平方公里，海拔约&lt;span>;3500&lt;/span>;米。&lt;/p>;

In the end, they were vulnerable to an ecological crisis and withered at the same time.

Not far to the west of the ruins is a border town called Copán Ruinas &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Copán Ruinas)&lt;/span>;, which is Spanish and means &quot;Ruins of Copan&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copan was the heyday of the Mayan civilization &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (250-900 AD, also known as the Classical Period)&lt;/span>; The most important city-state in the southeast. During the Classic Period, the Maya experienced Tikal&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Script_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Tikal)&lt;/span>; and Calakmul&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体,楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Calakmul)&lt;/span>;A long-standing confrontation between two powerful city-states, both located in the Yucatan Peninsula&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体,楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;(Yucatan)&lt;/span>;In the central part, one south and one north, separated by dense jungles, there have been continuous battles. Perhaps in order to expand its territory and resources, Tikal expanded to its rear in the early fifth century and established the city-state of Copan in a river valley in the middle of the Mesoamerican isthmus. The two sides formed a solid alliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copan was placed in the twelfth place in the mid-seventh century &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (roughly corresponding to the period of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty in China) It entered its heyday under King Chan Imix K&#39;awiil (r. 628-695)&lt;/span>;. Yanbao ascended the throne at the age of 15 and reigned for 67 years, the longest among the seventeen kings of Copán. His successor Uaxaclajuun Ub&#39;aah K&#39;awiil (reigned 695-738)&lt;/span>; in that era He is also considered a birthday boy, and he reigned for 43 years &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (same as Tang Xuanzong Li Longji)&lt;/span>;. The two kings ruled for a total of 110 years. During this period, Copán was transformed from a river valley city-state into an emerging empire, controlling a number of vassals and opening up trade routes to the Caribbean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the good times did not last long. Due to the large-scale construction and militarization of the Eighteen Rabbits, Copan, which had limited strength but overexpansion, quickly fell into crisis. In the middle of the eighth century, a rebellion similar to the &quot;Anshi Rebellion&quot; broke out: Batu was attacked by his cronies who had been placed in the small vassal state of Quirigua&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Quirigua)&lt;/span>;. -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(K&#39;ak&#39; Tiliw Chan Yopaat)&lt;/span>; Switched sides and rebelled. He was caught off guard and lost the battle. He was captured alive and taken to Quirigua, where he was captured in the main square. Beheading as a sacrifice - modern historians have noticed that two years ago, the monarch of the city-state of Calakmul made a special visit to Rainy Day, thus speculating that Calakmul may have planned and funded the rebellion behind the scenes. , the purpose is to cut off the right-hand man of the feuding Tikal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of Eighteen Rabbits, Copán, which was countered by Quirigua, has since gone downhill, although it once had a close relationship with Palenque, a large city-state in the west&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Palenque)&lt;/span>;The marriage tried to make a comeback, but the decline of the national destiny was irreversible. At the beginning of the ninth century, the history books of Copán stopped updating, and the river valley city-state suddenly declined and quickly disappeared into the resurgent rainforest vegetation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another thousand years later, the American archaeologist Stephens &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(John Stephens)&lt;/span>; and the British painter In 1839, Frederick Catherwood &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Frederick Catherwood)&lt;/span>; found the Copan ruins in 1839 based on the legends of the Mayan indigenous people. He made this comment on the ruins in the jungle:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is laid out in front of us, like a broken ship in the ocean.

It is around the large square that served as the political, religious and cultural center of the Mayan city-state. There is a small pyramid in the center of the square. On the north side are eight stone statues more than two meters high, six of which are carved with eighteen rabbits. These stone carvings are reminiscent of the architectural decoration style of South Asian temples: the details are extremely complex and gorgeous, but overall they lack highlights and personality. Perhaps it can be called Mayan Rococo style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the southeast side of the pyramid is a kickball court. Cuqiu is a unique sports competition of the Mayans and a noble sacrificial activity. Due to the lack of literature, it is not yet fully understood how it is played. It is generally believed to be a bit like today&#39;s volleyball. Players from both sides take turns hitting a solid rubber ball that symbolizes the sun. They are not allowed to touch the ball with their heads, hands and feet. Instead, you can only hit the ball with your elbow, hip or knee, hitting the ball behind the opponent, or causing the opponent to be unable to save the ball and lose points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as the annual Quidditch game at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels has a sure-fire setting for capturing the Golden Snitch, the kickball game also has a sure-fire rule. The kickball court is rectangular, with a high wall on each side of the long side. There is a stone ring at the top of the center of the high wall, which is similar to the &quot;basket&quot; in the basketball court, except that the basket is not horizontal, but vertical. , and the position is quite high, it is absolutely impossible for players to take off and dunk; the holes in the ring are also very small, only slightly larger than the diameter of a rubber ball. In the kickball game, if the player successfully passes the ball through the stone ring, he wins and the game ends immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the outcome of the kickball players, historians are still debating. Some people think that the loser will have his heart disemboweled and sacrificed to the gods. The other side has the opposite opinion and believes that only the winner can obtain this supreme thing. of glory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Cu stadium we see today is the third-generation stadium in the history of the city-state of Copan. It was built under the edict of the Eighteen Rabbits. Its two predecessors have been buried under its feet. This golf course is also the second largest golf course excavated in the Mayan world so far, second only to the Chichen Itza Stadium in Mexico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/GDDRFyXAphjGoYhSo02bo4mBPUVUF4pQ1qsPtl7G.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/GDDRFyXAphjGoYhSo02bo4mBPUVUF4pQ1qsPtl7G.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211198&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The court is played, and the high platform in the background is the royal temple of the King of Copan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the southeast side of the Cui Stadium is a spectacular &quot;Historic Staircase&quot;, which consists of 2,500 half-meter square There are 63 stone steps, about 30 meters high and 10 meters wide, with a slope of nearly 60 degrees, very steep. Each stone is engraved with Mayan hieroglyphics - the entire stone step records the history of the city-state of Copan from its establishment until Eighth century history. In order to protect the cultural relics from the sun and rain, a plastic canopy was erected above the &quot;Historic Stairs&quot;, which affected its appearance and internal lighting. Visitors are also unable to climb and can only look up from the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Directly south of the main square is a hill. The top of the mountain was once a temple. When kickball games and sacrificial ceremonies were held, the royal family of Copan looked down on the people from here. In its heyday, Copan had 27,000 people. Thousands of residents are indeed worthy of the title of “ten thousand peoples”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entire Copan ruins are not very big and can be browsed in two hours. Any place that is fenced with ropes or covered with plastic sheets is worth a closer look. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copan is known as the &quot;Paris of the Mayan World&quot; and is famous for its exquisite carvings and developed culture. So why did it suddenly fall during its heyday? Was it just because it suffered a rebellion? According to the results of archaeological excavations, the decline of Copan is actually the inevitable result of ecological deterioration, and the wasted national power of the Eighteen Rabbits only accelerated this process. The city-state is located in a fertile and narrow river valley, surrounded by steep mountains and low soil fertility. With the rise of city-states and rapid population growth, the limited farmland in river valleys could not sustain their food needs, so people went to the mountains in droves to clear up wasteland. The royal family also cut down a large number of mountain trees for fuel and made plaster to smear on palace buildings for waterproofing. As a result, local Vegetation has dropped sharply, the ecology has deteriorated, and mountain landslides have occurred repeatedly, submerging fertile farmland in river valleys and further reducing crop yields. Eventually agricultural production collapsed, and the city-states were abandoned and turned into large rainforests again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/jM4b2wvmJyMOn4acWV6Ixmd5kkoHLa9JCLxDWJjr.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/jM4b2wvmJyMOn4acWV6Ixmd5kkoHLa9JCLxDWJjr.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The stone macaw sculpture above the court&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is dusk , the few tourists dispersed one after another, and I sat on a high platform beside the golf course, with a stone sculpture of a macaw head above my head. Quietly watch as the large square gradually becomes a paradise for macaws. They either glide in groups and chirp freely, or perch in pairs on branches, preening each other&#39;s feathers lovingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fifteen hundred years ago, the Mayans used macaws as their totems and held fiery and bloody kickball games under their curious gaze. Nowadays, the Mayan civilization has disappeared, but the macaw is still the master here, and it has never changed for thousands of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The overlord of the Mayan world - Tikal&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Tikal ruins are located in the Mayan rainforest in northern Guatemala. To the north and west is Mexico, a large country in Central America, and to the east is Central America. The only English speaking country is Belize. Due to the deep grass and forests, the borders between the three countries were drawn using latitude and longitude lines, and a square rectangle was drawn on the map of the Yucatan Peninsula. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not far south from Tikal is Lake Petén Itzá, which is shaped like a hammerhead shark. )&lt;/span>; and its south coast island Flores &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Flores)&lt;/span>; - the last religious center of the Mayan civilization , it was not destroyed by the cultural genocide atrocities of Spanish colonists until the end of the seventeenth century. The closest airport to Tikal is built on the land southeast of Flores Island: Mayan World International Airport. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I took a Saab 340 twin-turboprop plane from Guatemala City—probably the smallest commercial airliner I have ever flown in, with only thirty seats—under the intoxicating sunset over the lake and sky. We landed here and drove 70 kilometers to the Tikal ruins early the next morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/1OW5BqQAwjMkn1CCLOm8twqn0b902T1RjhLBnWK3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/1OW5BqQAwjMkn1CCLOm8twqn0b902T1RjhLBnWK3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tikal Temple No. 1&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tikal is a Mayan temple One of the two unparalleled heroes who stood side by side with Calakmul during the classical period of civilization. The surrounding terrain is low-lying and densely covered with swamps, and Tikal is a low hill with neither drought nor flooding. It has become a rare livable place in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is generally short of water. It has been there since at least the seventh century BC. Inhabited by the Mayans. About a thousand years later, the Maya world entered the Classical Period. With the rich local obsidian resources, Tikal could not only build sharp weapons to improve its own combat power during times of war, but also sell them to other city-states for profit in times of peace, so its national power grew rapidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through international trade, Tikal originated from Teotihuacan, a large country located in central Mexico There, I learned how to fight with spears. I no longer need to fight with the enemy face to face. Instead, I surround the enemy and kill them by throwing spears. This achieves a &quot;long-range strike&quot; to a certain extent, thus significantly reducing our own casualties and more effectively reducing our own casualties. Become the overlord of the Mayan world with advanced military ideas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Teotihuacan sent an expeditionary force to raid its students at the end of the fourth century - the straight-line distance between the two places is more than a thousand kilometers, which is equivalent to the Tang army relying entirely on boats and walking&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Teotihuacan and Mayan civilizations failed to invent wheels and vehicles)&lt;/span>;, carrying all weapons and equipment and food and grass supplies on their shoulders, starting from Chang&#39;an Expedition to Tuyuhun on the Qinghai Lake - and once fully controlled the political and military power of Tikal. But the two places were too far apart after all. Teotihuacan, which started out on the Mexican plateau, could not establish itself in the humid monsoon rainforest of the Yucatan Peninsula for a long time, so Tikal eventually regained power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highlight of the Copan ruins is the beautifully carved stone statues, while the highlight of Tikal is its tall pyramid. Although limited by ancient construction technology, the pyramid of Tikal cannot reach the sky, but at least it can tower through the forest. Standing on the top of the pyramid, you feel as if you are standing on the tip of a sharp sword, piercing through the endless mountains. Rainforest canopy. If you imagine the lush forest canopy as clouds, then these pyramids are like Shushan Mountain breaking through the clouds and coming out through the clouds, giving people a very majestic feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/1W1L8Yf8zisdbLt0F3bJlnf8CL3OtZwlLDJKGtnO.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/1W1L8Yf8zisdbLt0F3bJlnf8CL3OtZwlLDJKGtnO.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tikal Temple 1-3&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;mentioned Are there any differences between pyramids, Mayan pyramids and Egyptian pyramids? The Egyptian pyramid, as its name suggests, is similar to the Chinese character for &quot;gold&quot;. It is a square pyramid composed of a square base and four isosceles triangles. The Mayan pyramid looks similar to the Egyptian pyramid at first glance, but if you look closely, you will find that it is not the same. A pointed cone without a top, its cross-section is an isosceles trapezoid, as if a small pyramid was cut off from the top of a large pyramid. The base is not always square. For example, several large pyramids at the Tikal site have rectangular bases, and the Uxmal site in Mexico also has the Warlock Pyramid with an oval base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there no pointed cones on the top of the Mayan pyramids? This is related to the different functions of the two types of pyramids. The Egyptian pyramid is a pharaoh&#39;s tomb, with a hollow interior, and a tomb chamber is built to store the pharaoh&#39;s mummy; the Mayan pyramid is the base of the temple, and the purpose of building it is to highlight the sublimity of the temple. Therefore, the Mayan pyramid is generally solid, in order to leave To build a temple in space, a platform must be left at the top, so there is no top cone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the different functions, the shapes and sizes of the two types of pyramids are also quite different. There is a temple on the top of the Mayan pyramid, and the priests need to go to the altar to perform rituals or observe the stars at night. Therefore, there are stone steps on both sides of the Mayan pyramid or on the central axis of the front, rear, left, and right sides; while the Egyptian pyramid is a pharaoh&#39;s tomb and does not require climbing to the top. , so there is only the entrance to the mausoleum at the bottom, and there are no stone steps leading to the top cone. Also due to sacrificial needs, Mayan pyramids are generally not high. The tallest Tikal Temple IV is only 64.6 meters, which can be said to be dwarfed by the Egyptian pyramids: Egypt&#39;s tallest Pyramid of Khufu was 146.6 meters high when it was built. After 4,500 years, Due to the erosion of wind and sand, it is still 138.8 meters high, more than twice the height of Tikal IV Temple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the amount of construction earthwork is proportional to the cube of the size, the Mayan pyramid is an order of magnitude smaller than the Egyptian pyramid, so the amount of building materials and engineering required is much smaller than the latter, and the number of constructions is much higher. the latter. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 100,000 Mayan pyramids in Mexico alone, while there are only more than 100 pyramids in Egypt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are four most important pyramids in Tikal, including one on the east and west sides of the main square, which means a couple looking at each other. Temple No. 1 on the east side was built in the mid-eighth century and is 44 meters high. It is a rare mausoleum-shaped pyramid in the Mayan world. It is the burial place of the famous Zhongxing master of Tikal, the Double Moon King _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Jasaw Chan K&#39;awiil I, reigned 682-734)&lt;/span>;, he led the city-state through the jungle to defeat the old enemy Calakmul in 695, leaving the latter unable to recover, and could only rely on Small tricks such as secretly fomenting rebellion and weakening Copán were used to relieve military pressure from Tikal, and Tikal entered its second heyday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/30/tk9W7RDl4NjfWRt8qcIQ3gheQ3KgyxqIFyFhE9UM.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1445&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/30/tk9W7RDl4NjfWRt8qcIQ3gheQ3KgyxqIFyFhE9UM.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;210475&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shuangyuewang Stone Stele Relief&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No. 1 The stone steps of the temple are narrow and steep, causing at least two tourists to slip and fall to their deaths. Tourists are now prohibited from climbing. Temple No. 2 on the west side is also a mausoleum, where the queen of the Twin Moon King, Lady Twelve Macaw, is buried. >;. Her mausoleum is six meters shorter than her husband&#39;s pyramid, and the stone steps are wider. However, direct climbing is prohibited. Instead, wooden steps are built behind it for visitors to walk up to the top of the tower and overlook the elegant and quiet grand square. There are more than twenty stone pillars erected in the square. They have the same function as the stone statues in the main square of the Copan ruins. They are used to commemorate the achievements of the previous kings. However, the stone carving art of Tikal is far inferior to that of Copan, so there are no stone statues here but only stone pillars. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tikal&#39;s Temple No. 3 is located on the west side of Temple No. 2. The front of its base has been covered by vegetation, and it is like a slope, buried in the dense jungle, but it is 55 meters high. The top of the tower stands majestically, far higher than the surrounding trees, giving viewers a strong shock with the tenacious struggle between nature and manpower across the vicissitudes of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the Tikal temple we see today is the product of archaeological excavations, stripping away its trees, cleaning up its soil, and repairing its stone steps. When the European archaeological expedition first came here in the early 19th century, all the pyramids looked like Temple No. 3 now. At first glance, they were nothing more than steep mountains that suddenly rose up from the flat ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Temple No. 4 is located at the western end of the core area of ​​the site. It was built in 741 by the son of the Twin Moon King. It is the tallest temple in Tikal and the tallest building in the Mayan world. Looking eastward from its top platform to Temple No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, it is easy to get the illusion that the continuous tropical rainforest trees under your feet are just a patch of low bushes, while the three temples are like three stone monuments, rising from the bushes. The bushes stretched out tenaciously - the scale of everything suddenly shrunk here, and I seemed to have entered a miniature world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/pyk0T8NZrX2ucXSOFELI9SpZDxrvzaxlVxGy7ek3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/pyk0T8NZrX2ucXSOFELI9SpZDxrvzaxlVxGy7ek3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211203&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A temple in &quot;The Lost World&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Starting from Temple No. 4, I continued southward deep into the rainforest, looking for the ancient pyramid &quot;The Lost World&quot; which was built in 700 BC &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;( El Mundo Perdido)&lt;/span>;. The number of tourists gradually dwindled, and only me, a group of white-nosed coatis walking happily with their long tails wagging high, and the low roars echoing in the forest were the only ones left in the dense forest. At first I thought it was just the background sound played by the park through the loudspeaker - because if any carnivorous beast really made such a loud noise, it meant that it had arrived around me and was ready to hunt at any time - and I was surprised by the unique interest of the player. Later I realized that the breathtaking roar came from the branches above my head: two medium-sized howler monkeys were crawling back and forth anxiously, announcing the territory of their group with continuous roars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prosperous age created by the Twin Moon King lasted for nearly a hundred years. After entering the ninth century, the entire Mayan world entered a drought period that had not been seen in seven thousand years. Starvation was everywhere and the city-states were in ruins. As the largest city-state at the time, with a population of nearly 200,000 at its peak, Tikal declined rapidly after facing famine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last king of Tikal who went down in history reused the name of the Twin Moon King and called himself Jasaw Chan K&#39;awiil II, but this did not allow him to defeat nature and revive the country&#39;s destiny. By the end of the 10th century, Tikal was reclaimed by nature, the cornfields no longer existed, and the majestic temples and tombs of the ancestors were covered by dense forests. From that time on, the howler monkeys established their homes in the center of the former city-state, making powerful sounds that could be heard several kilometers away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[为什么全国大部分打印店都“姓”湘？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257190]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walking into the university campus, if you find the print shop owner saying Don’t be too surprised when you hear the rich modulations of “Shapu”, because if you continue to pay attention, you will find that this accent can even be found in print shops in the streets and alleys across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hunanese are not only the leaders in the spicy food industry, but also have great confidence in the literary and printing industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, Xinhua County, located in central Hunan, has shouldered the heavy responsibility of the &quot;Wenyinxiang Army&quot;.
