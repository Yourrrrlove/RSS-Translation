A few years later, she won the second prize in popular singing in the professional group of the Youth Singing Competition. If she embarks on the path of an acting singer, she can choose from many record companies, performance opportunities, and gain both fame and fortune; she can also leave everything behind and pursue what she really wants to do, but she doesn&#39;t know what she wants to do at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1991, the year after participating in the Youth Singing Competition, 23-year-old Zhu Zheqin left Guangzhou for Chengdu, still determined to be a tour guide. Her collaborator at the time and for many years to come, the composer He Xuntian, was a little angry and said it was a pity that she didn&#39;t sing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although she failed to become a traveler, she later went to India, Bhutan, Nepal, Tibet, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, and Xinjiang to collect music. Her singing has also gone far. Her first album &quot;Yellow Child&quot; (1992) showed artistic qualities in addition to popular singing. &quot;A Sister&#39;s Drum&quot; (1995) was published in 56 countries, becoming the first A Chinese album released globally, with &quot;Yangjinma&quot; (1997), the scope expanded to 65 countries. In the wave of New Age Music that emerged at the end of the 20th century, Zhu Zheqin is a representative figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes she attributes herself to the laws of history - her popularity in the 1990s coincided with people&#39;s pursuit of spirituality after their material life was abundant. Sometimes she just said that people are really strange. What is a living thing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It took her a long time to figure out what she wanted to do. During this period, he released 6 albums, including a live recording album, held a world tour, served as the China Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Development Program, and initiated goodwill actions and original design platforms based on the protection and inheritance of Chinese traditional music and handicrafts. Then, by chance, I started sound art and have been creating it happily ever since. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, social activities and artistic creation caused her to become relatively quiet in the field of music performance. After not giving a concert for nearly ten years, on September 30, 2023, she performed new music and sound art works, including a small concert, at the Aranya Jinshanling Community in Chengde, Hebei Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I haven&#39;t sung for you for a long time.&quot; I saw her on the second day of the performance. We walked into a meditation room at the foot of the mountain. She took off her shoes and coat, and her black body disappeared on the gradually dimming tatami. Most of the lighting in this room comes from a floor-to-ceiling window. Outside the window is the dry landscape, only a sliver of sky is exposed, and dusk is approaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/t1U27X2z1WbK5TikYw6d0l9KQIox47yu50D2XHb2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/t1U27X2z1WbK5TikYw6d0l9KQIox47yu50D2XHb2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255457&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Mountain Questions·Secrets of Nature&quot; live performance&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;A long-lost slightly impromptu concert&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starting from July, at the invitation of Aranya, Zhu Zheqin stayed in Jinshanling for three months to create music and sound art. It is located at the junction of Beijing and Hebei. The ridge is dotted with ruins of the Great Wall of the Ming Dynasty, which are ruined and mixed with rubble. To the southwest is the capital city, where the forests are gradually dyed in autumn. The Jinshanling area is inhabited by aboriginal mountain people, and real estate development has attracted many &quot;new mountain people&quot; to buy homes or travel with their families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Intentionally or unintentionally, Ma Yin, the founder of Aranya brand, wants to create a paradise here. First of all, transportation here is inconvenient, and secondly, it is extremely close to nature. At a dinner party and a conversation, Ma Yindu said: In the next ten years or more, we will spend more time in pain than happiness in our lives, so warming people&#39;s hearts may be a mainstream thing in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Zheqin’s exhibition will be completed in two landmark buildings in Aranya Jinshanling. One is the upper courtyard designed by architect Liu Yichun. It is built according to the mountain and is composed of a courtyard, a terrace and a hall. It is the spiritual highland of the community. One is the Valley Concert Hall designed by architects Li Hu and Huang Wenjing. It looks like a boulder and an alien object from the sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the three months of residency, Zhu Zheqin visited the concert hall and upper courtyard at different times, early morning, dusk, midnight, windy, rainy or foggy. &quot;It&#39;s like you get to know a very strange person.&quot; Friend, you have to know his character, know when he is the softest and most moving, and also know when he is the strongest. This is my working method.&quot; Especially the Valley Concert Hall, contrary to conventional concert halls, it does not There is no condition to completely purify the sounds of human voices and musical instruments, because its roof reaches the sky and the four walls are cut out, connecting the inside and outside. Sitting on the concrete seats of the concert hall is like sitting in a hollow boulder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It is completely opposite to the concept of a standard concert hall. It does not block ambient sounds, but hopes that you can hear ambient sounds in an open state, feel the changes in light, and know that everything wakes up in the morning. .&quot; For musicians, these are unique and rare performance venues that burst the imagination, but they also have great limitations. They make people rethink, what kind of performance is a good performance? What kind of listening experience does this performance bring to the audience? Why do these two buildings appear here? Why do people come here? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On several occasions, Zhu Zheqin went mountain climbing with Bai Chunxiang, the local Great Wall protector. Once she saw the back of Bai Chunxiang sitting on the Great Wall. She looked at it for a long time and thought, how should we as contemporary people deal with themselves in these cultures? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/lbaQoHgExHNiEcG259bwKpOzStLmFWBm1CmnzTHh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/lbaQoHgExHNiEcG259bwKpOzStLmFWBm1CmnzTHh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255461&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Mountain Questions·Secrets of Nature&quot; live performance&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;She seemed to be embarking on a new journey, with old experiences falling off like frozen leaves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Zhu Zheqin spent 15 days in the mountains to collect various sounds, downloaded sounds from other planets from NASA’s official website, and used ambient electronic music editing throughout. She decided to compose in a minimalist way in three sections. The melody has only five notes, do re mi so la, and the lyrics only have three sentences - &quot;Seeing mountains is mountains, seeing water is water. Seeing mountains is not mountains, Seeing water is not water. Seeing mountains is still mountains, and seeing water is still water.&quot; She invited Jinshanling aborigines and &quot;new mountain people&quot; to form a choir, and also successively contacted other musicians, including arranger Meng Ke Zhuolan, guzheng Chang Jing, and wind blower Wang Hua and percussionist Chen Shijie, all of whom participated in her tour ten years ago, are now reunited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The complete performance design is as follows: in the afternoon, the audience follows the guide silently throughout the entire process through the four performance locations along the upper courtyard building complex, using their &quot;hearing&quot; to experience nature and the musicians&#39; understanding of natural sounds. The performance of the performance was &quot;Asking the Mountain&quot;; in the evening, I entered the Valley Concert Hall to listen to the concert, which was &quot;Asking the Mountain&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The overall structure of &quot;Asking the Mountain&quot; is strictly arranged, and each paragraph is mainly improvised. The day&#39;s weather, audience interaction, and the sounds of flora and fauna in the valley will all become part of the improvisation. Therefore, except for the chorus, which is composed, the other parts are improvised, and each rehearsal and performance will be different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final rehearsal and recording was going on in the concert hall the night before the official performance. At 8 o&#39;clock, the mountain breeze passed through the hall, and the recording tube was full of whistling wind. Meng Ke Zhuolan&#39;s curly hair was blown all over her head. She stood at the mixer at the top of the back row and shouted to Zhu Zheqin at the bottom: &quot;Aren&#39;t you scared?&quot; Zhu Zheqin looked at her happily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Later we thought it was actually good to have wind, because if your music is open enough, it can accommodate this.&quot; Meng Kezhuolan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the night, the rehearsal was over. The next morning, Zhu Zheqin got up and turned on the recording to listen again. Suddenly, he kept crying. &quot;I feel extremely happy. I have never shed tears because of a good meal, but I may have read a poem, stood in front of the sea, watched a movie, and listened to Dupree&#39;s Elgar Cello Concerto in E minor, It makes me feel like my life has been turned into gold.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;166 cushions were squeezed into the originally 140-seat Valley Music Hall, and people were still coming in. Many people had to stand at the entrance to listen. At 6pm, the show starts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concert hall was very dark at first, with only a beam of white light shining in from the roof, scanning the entire venue back and forth. In the center of the sunken stage, Zhu Zheqin’s long hair was tied up in a bunch, with his eyes closed, like an immortal sitting in a cave. middle. The sound of 432 Hz always surrounds this fairy cave. This is a soothing and healing sound frequency that Zhu Zheqin specially used this time. It is superimposed with the sounds of streams, frogs, chimes and alien planets to create a space far wider than a concert hall. Zhu Zheqin&#39;s voice has a long breath and a wide range, from far to near, from humming to singing. She was so happy with the performance that she clapped her hands and danced, swaying her three-meter-long costume. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Derek Bailey discusses the concept of free improvisation in Improvisation: Its Essence and Musical Practice, he considers it to be a celebration of the moment. Li Jianhong, a musician who is keen on improvisation and the translator of &quot;Improvisation&quot;, regards improvisation as a channel. He believes that for a conscious musician, improvisation is always a way to explore the true self. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhu Zheqin, all these are true, and can be interpreted in another way. Improvisation is also a coexistence between everyone and nature, and is a humble and great part of it, like flowing water, frogs, wind, and trees. Like crows, they live for a short period of time, but they also create enduring arts such as music, poetry, and painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the three-part singing was over, the musicians were supposed to be introduced, but that night she felt that anything she said in the middle of the performance was superfluous. So she performed all the way to the impromptu &quot;Finale&quot; that was originally prepared for everyone to leave at will. Halfway through the &quot;Finale&quot;, people still stayed where they were. Then she introduced the choir and performing members, thanked many people, and then said: &quot; It&#39;s been a long time since I sang for you.&quot; She paused and continued, &quot;We are already at the age when we are about to go down the mountain, but we climbed up a mountain together. This is rare in life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until the time Near 8 o&#39;clock, Zhu Zheqin was worried that a strong wind was coming, and finally told the audience who were unwilling to leave, everyone should go back. People stood up one after another, but she was reluctant to leave. Amid the rustling footsteps leaving the concert hall, her singing voice suddenly sounded again, with a broad and clear voice: &quot;Seeing mountains is mountains, seeing water is water. Seeing mountains is not mountains, seeing water is not water. Seeing mountains is still water. Mountains, water is still water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/O1EkFns46Ibu19yVyHZzEqdLs92RMmfbED2Z0a6c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0 &quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/O1EkFns46Ibu19yVyHZzEqdLs92RMmfbED2Z0a6c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255462&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;World Hear·Ethnic Music Discovery Tour&quot; Guizhou Station, Zhu Zheqin led a team to record Miao girls singing &quot;Soul of Rice Flowers&quot;&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Spiritual hometown&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A week later, I met Guo Rong in Beijing. Zhu Zheqin has been working together for 11 years. Guo Rong found that every time there was a new art project, Zhu Zheqin would always leave a place for the &quot;old people&quot; who had worked together. Zhu Zheqin is surrounded by collaborators who have worked together for more than ten years, and she has become close partners in life with many of them. Guo Rong said that Zhu Zheqin maintained his enthusiasm for people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large part of the reason why Zhu Zheqin was so moved at the end of the concert and later at the dinner was that many friends came, including Xi Chuan, Li Xianting, Xu Bing, Zhang Xiaogang, Wu Ershan... &quot;It&#39;s too luxurious.&quot; She choked up when talking about these names, &quot;Their works have been with me for many years, and the spirit, energy, touch, and encouragement released by their creations have been useful to me for life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After (New Crown) I miss these friends very much during the epidemic. I feel that life is meaningless. They come and go naturally, but they are the scenery of my life. If they need my voice, I think I should sing to them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dinner As usual, let the guest of honor say a few words during the ceremony. Zhu Zheqin took the microphone and said he had nothing to say. Everyone said, &quot;Let&#39;s sing.&quot; She said, &quot;Come on.&quot; &quot;&quot;Ajie Drum&quot;.&quot; It&#39;s too long ago. &quot;Return.&quot; Just right, this is the theme song she wrote and sang for the movie &quot;Feng Shen&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Christmas Eve 2019, Zhu Zheqin received a call from Wu Ershan and asked her if she wanted to go to Qingdao for Christmas. When I arrived in Qingdao, I discovered that it was a huge studio with thousands of people busy every day. Wuershan has been preparing for 10 years and spent 3 billion to make a trilogy of mythological epics. He hoped that Zhu Zheqin would write a song for &quot;Fengshen&quot;. They met as early as the 1990s. Zhu Zheqin watched Wu Ershan move from contemporary art to advertising shooting and then to film director. She felt that she did not have the courage to target a wider audience like Wu Ershan, and subconsciously refused: &quot;This is For a commercial blockbuster, I am not a traffic star and cannot bring you traffic.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Our first choice is Teacher Zhu, and he is also the only choice. We want to write an art song with a melody Full, and at the same time the voice span is very large, because if you want to express very full emotions, it will involve a very large span between notes. No one (except her) can sing.&quot; said Meng Kezhuolan, who is Wu Ershan&#39;s wife , is also the music director of &quot;Fengshen&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The guests fell silent, there was no accompaniment, and the sound was dry and dull, not suitable for singers to sing. But the three-part song was sung melodiously and stretched by Zhu Zheqin. It tells the story of the young Ji Fa who was sent to Chaoge as a hostage, and then escaped from the control of the tyrannical Shang King Yin Shou and returned to his hometown. The song was still being recorded during the COVID-19 epidemic. She had to return from abroad. According to epidemic prevention regulations, she was quarantined when she was in transit in Hong Kong, and then quarantined again after arriving in Beijing. Zhu Zheqin said that this is Ji Fa&#39;s homesickness, and it also embodies some of her nostalgia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 11 o&#39;clock during the dinner, the brightly lit restaurant suddenly lost power and became completely dark. The staff found real and fake candles for lighting, and the guests were happy and cheered softly. Then someone said, let’s go see the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The moonlight is bright and clear, the mountains are silent, and the cold night makes people shrink their necks and stamp their feet. A small group of people filed out through the narrow glass door and gathered on the platform to sing again, &quot;The moon passes through the white lotus-like clouds&quot; and &quot;You ask me how deeply I love you/How much I love you.&quot; / My love is true / My love is true / The moon represents my heart”... Sometimes it is a solo, sometimes it is a chorus of three or three, and someone brings a piano, and the echoes are like ripples. spread among the crowd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;They will definitely lose power when they are together. The spiritual energy field is too strong.&quot; Zhu Zheqin also remembered during the interview, &quot;It was like that in the 1980s and 1990s. There were no exhibitions at that time. There were no paintings to sell, no records, no concerts, all of this was nothing. Zhang Xiaogang was still painting stage sets for the Sichuan Opera Troupe as a living profession. But what he loved most was painting. He painted hard, and he had no money. No reason. In recent years, it seems that people paint just to go to auction, and how high the price is, and how good it is. In fact, it is not true. In my opinion, those are just projected phenomena. There is a powerful spiritual power behind it. I What I cherish is that kind of thing. I think that kind of thing will change the world and heal myself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at it this way, the narrow door that everyone passes through from the restaurant to the terrace seems to have become a door to time and space. , outside the door is their spiritual hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Zheqin said: &quot;I think people of every era are the masters of this era. The history of this era is created and left by us, so what do we want to create? If we are dissatisfied with reality, Then why don&#39;t we do some ourselves? I&#39;m not one to complain.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She was singing &quot;A True Story&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;The Story of the Red-Crowned Crane&quot;&lt;/span>;) and became famous after winning the Youth Singing Competition, a fan appeared at the door of the hotel in the middle of the night and said to her, I think you are the Red-Crowned Crane. She was scared away because &quot;it impressed them so strongly that they stayed there forever.&quot; She didn’t know what she wanted at that time, but she knew what she didn’t want—not to become a singer, not to be packaged, not to enter a paradigm. &quot;Someone in my heart said, no, no, no. But, what are you going to do?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/10/25/yQeEdjBF1wJS0Ud62RZkcYfqakKALJiTfhyn62F3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25 /yQeEdjBF1wJS0Ud62RZkcYfqakKALJiTfhyn62F3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255460&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Double CD &quot;Moonrise&quot; by Zhu Zheqin and ethnic singers&lt;span style =&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1990s, the market economy developed rapidly and social trends moved away from single collectivism. Zhu Zheqin recalled That feeling of liberating the mind, &quot;Actually, people are quite confused, and they don&#39;t know where they are in this coordinate.&quot; She did not sign with any record company, nor did she join an art troupe, and disappeared from the public eye. She went to Chengdu from Guangzhou, and a year later, &quot;Yellow Child&quot; composed by He Xuntian and sung by Zhu Zheqin was released. Later, historian Luo Xin wrote about a detail when he was reflecting on and criticizing racial thinking. On a winter night when he was working on his doctoral thesis, he heard &quot;Yellow Children&quot; being played on the radio, &quot;that empty and desolate feeling of loneliness and hopelessness.&quot; &quot;It tells the loss of the East in front of the West.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years later, &quot;A Sister Drum&quot; was released. This was the second collaboration between Zhu Zheqin and He Xuntian. They took a trip to Tibet, which they regarded as a spiritual holy land, and returned many times. But no matter how impressive the natural scenery, humanities and art in Tibetan areas are, what makes Zhu Zheqin most unforgettable is still the &quot;people&quot;. It is &quot;the scenes of their lives in poverty that made me have to re-evaluate the weight of my life.&quot; She got a new name, Dadawa. Dadawa is reminiscent of Dadaism, which was later basically annexed by Surrealism. Dadawa is the Tibetan word for the moon. Dadawa is neither the East nor the West. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ajie Drum&quot; and &quot;Yangjinma&quot; two years later form a complete expression of their Tibet, which is mysterious and strong on the one hand, and everyday and light on the other, bringing Zhu Zheqin to the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years later, she also made a physical journey across Asia. From Kashmir to the Himalayas, I sweated and sneezed while clicking the shutter in the spice markets of India, and took a tricycle to look for gypsies. Gypsy Bopa played the music on a very simple folk violin. Zhu Zheqin was fascinated by it. It took him a while to come back to his senses and said that it was like hearing real music for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also during that trip, she saw Hindus waiting for death by the Ganges River, and the cremated corpses rolled down to her feet. &quot;Journey to the Ganges is another starting point in my life, where I realize the meaninglessness of life. Our life is redefined by our values ​​and culture, which celebrates the greatness of life. A person&#39;s birth must be celebrated, and a person&#39;s death must be commemorated. . But if you imagine that a fish is born and dies, it is a natural thing, nothing more. The truth of the universe is that you are like a leaf, yellow today and withered tomorrow.&quot; She thought, if life is like this, what will happen to people?

She spent most of her time at home, cooking, taking care of the yard, and thinking about nothing. &quot;I rarely have such a stage where I shut down my phone. Suddenly I felt how fragile the world is and how vulnerable human civilization is to an invisible virus.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second year, she began to I thought, if there are no recordings, no exhibitions, no concerts in the future, what else will I do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Zheqin was admitted to the Guangzhou &quot;Little Skylark&quot; Chorus at the age of 7 and performed at the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall. At the age of 13, she recorded children&#39;s singing teaching materials. She can sing any type of opera. During school, she worked as a singer in a karaoke hall, and then she became famous. , hold concerts, explore your own expression and style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the trip to India shattered the meaning of life, Zhu Zheqin felt that he had reached a point in time where all expressions seemed pale and feeble, and he had to look inward to find something more essential. &quot;When you find yourself weightless or confused, only by daring to throw yourself out can you have a chance to regain your life.&quot; In 2009, she accepted the appointment as the China Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Development Program and launched the &quot;World Sees-China &quot;Ethnic Culture Protection and Development Goodwill Action&quot;, conducting field research on folk music and handicrafts in ethnic minority areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, she realized that she and the entire generation had a very weak understanding of their own culture. Zhu Zheqin said: &quot;In modern China, a &#39;modernity&#39; suddenly appeared, but this &#39;modernity&#39; may have nothing to do with its own culture and is a collage. From the time we started to imitate to the time we realized that imitation was not It is not ourselves, and then we have to find and construct it. The first stage is to create something from scratch, and then we have to take root, grow up, be local, and reflect the face of the people of this land and water.&quot; She deliberately made young people Many musicians participated in the project to organize and adapt folk songs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, she released her last album to date, &quot;Moonrise&quot;, a double CD. One is a collection of original ethnic minority music, and the other is a musician&#39;s work that has been arranged and sung. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, the creative team of &quot;Moonrise&quot; held a world tour with ethnic singers and young musicians. Meng Kezhuolan served as composer and arranger. She was less than 30 years old at the time and mainly wrote chamber music. Before a performance, Zhu Zheqin asked Meng Kezhuolan to come and listen. That was the first time she heard a singer and musician singing Miao Fei Song sitting in front of her. As soon as the other person opened his mouth, she got goosebumps all over her body. &quot;I was suddenly photographed there. His earthy, tanned look no longer existed in front of me. I thought to myself that if he were in a Miao village, all the girls would fall in love with him.&quot; Until a few days ago, wind player Wang Hua still remembered that tour during the rehearsal of &quot;Asking the Mountain&quot; and said that it was the best performance he had participated in in so many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The &#39;World Seeing&#39; thing seems to help others, but it actually saved me.&quot; Zhu Zheqin said frankly, &quot;After the meaning of life was shattered, it gave me a stage to learn and do something. Specific things. At that time, I had a very big feeling. I thought I was a drop of water, but I was also an ocean. Only when I became a water drop could I be an ocean.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But after that, Zhu Zheqin never released an album and had only a handful of public performances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As a singer, I use singing to express my thoughts and feelings, but apart from that, I have always been more interested in inner energy.” Along this path, she entered sound art, “I want to Know what else is inside me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it didn&#39;t go well at first. In 2014, Gao Peng, then director of Today Art Museum, approached Zhu Zheqin and asked her to create a sound art work. After two visits, her reply was pending. Guo Rong hoped to persuade Zhu Zheqin to start a new attempt. She said: &quot;Teacher Zhu, I came to your team because I like your music and your voice.&quot; Something seemed to be touched in Zhu Zheqin&#39;s heart. A few days later, she flew abroad. Before leaving, she left a note for Guo Rong, which listed 20 issues, including time points, production schedules, and problems faced... Guo Rong was relieved when she saw it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Actually, I think the process of her asking these questions is also a process of self-answering. If I didn&#39;t answer her at that time, someone else would answer her. If no one else answered her, she would answer these questions herself. Question.&quot; Guo Rong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2014, the Sound·Jue Zhu Zheqin sound art exhibition opened. Today Art Museum was painted into a dark box, with a pool on the ground. Zhu Zheqin recruited dozens of people to walk back and forth beside the pool, making sounds and playing chimes. She did not sing, but stood in the crowd, and all the sounds turned into ripples, reflected on the wall, turning the invisible into something tangible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The mystery of all things lies in the combination of things. The world is a temporary combination of consciousness, and music is sound. The essence of sound is waves and vibrations. So I think vibration is a very direct way to approach consciousness. . I am very lucky to be on this road.&quot; Zhu Zheqin said, &quot;It was only when I became aware of my voice that I fully understood myself. I want to create a field and let everyone enter, so that people can realize that everyone is actually affected by something. Driven by an inner energy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are at the scene, as both Meng Ke Zhuolan and Guo Rong have described, it seems that everyone has come to another time and space, temporarily breaking away from external forces and moving inwards. Zhu Zheqin tried to create this feeling in his seven subsequent sound art works, including &quot;Asking the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Asking the Mountain&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three lyrics in &quot;Ask the Mountain&quot; are also a portrayal of her journey back to her inner self. In the beginning, people looked at things through the universal laws of phenomena. The saying goes: &quot;Seeing mountains is not mountains.&quot; When superficial phenomena are denied, solid and perfect things become vulnerable, and perfection is just a fantasy. This is: &quot;Seeing mountains is not mountains.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, &quot;After the first year of the COVID-19 epidemic, I thought, when I was 6 years old, no one said that I would have concerts, wouldn&#39;t I still sing every day? I just love this thing, it is Bringing me joy in life, helping me grow and perceive the world, isn’t it more real than anything else? When you reach this point, you will see your true nature. Just like birds singing in the sky and fish swimming in the sea, if I have wings, I will Fly.&quot; Zhu Zheqin said, &quot;In such an era, I think it is more important to maintain an imagination, maintain poetry, and maintain free thoughts about reality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is this a mountain or a mountain? . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the concert &quot;Asking the Mountain&quot;, everyone will get a small guide card at the entrance of the Valley Concert Hall, which reads: Creation stems from the perception of the mountains, and does not seek to understand the mountains and the world. Any definition of &quot;mountain dwelling&quot; nor explore any answers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of the performance, I walked up the mountain along the path connecting the Valley Concert Hall and the Upper Court. There was a small dark green sign hanging on a tree on the roadside, with a black arrow pointing to the depths of the mountain. There is a line of small words attached to the arrow: There will be answers in the mountains. Continuing in the direction pointed by the arrow, the same arrow guide appeared one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sign ends in front of an old cave. This is a small house built against a shallow cave, with three real people enshrined inside. There was a kang built against the wall. There were traces of fire underneath, but now the window paper was broken and air leaked from all sides. There was no sound for a while. Am I the only one in this world? &quot;Will there be answers in the mountains&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While listening to me talk about this experience, Zhu Zheqin looked at a certain place on the roof. The meditation room fell into silence, and became darker as the sky darkened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, she said, when you start asking, that is the beginning of the Tao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Thanks to Huang Yao for his help)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[她研究在美中国本科留学生，发现高远志向下的挣扎和迷茫]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259545]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/29/o0I00cNuZ36LrUM9459x0QRIdqPX4WLh5Jn3Kh8n.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1226&quot; height=&quot;817&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/o0I00cNuZ36LrUM9459x0QR IdqPX4WLh5Jn3Kh8n. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255946&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 17, 2022 local time, New York University graduates celebrated their graduation ceremony. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The annual application season for international students is here again. According to the &quot;2023 Study Abroad in China White Paper&quot; released by New Oriental, more than 50% of people intend to study abroad with a bachelor&#39;s degree or below. The situation of studying abroad is picking up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, two other reports are also worthy of attention. On September 25, 2023, the National Student Credentials Certification Center in the United States released a report &quot;Completing College&quot; that showed that the undergraduate dropout rate for Chinese students in the United States was as high as 25%. In the same month, WholeRen, a Pennsylvania-based education consulting company, released the &quot;2023 White Paper on the Current Situation of Chinese Students in the United States.&quot; According to statistics, 70% of Chinese students who have been dismissed from the United States are undergraduates, and more than half of the students are studying in the top 50 schools in the United States. The top two reasons for being dismissed were academic dishonesty and poor academic performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The data only presents the tip of the iceberg. In the seemingly distant American education system, many Chinese students are indeed experiencing struggles under the glamorous impression&lt;/span>;. Ma Yingyi, a professor of sociology at Syracuse University in the United States, wrote the book &quot;Ambitious and Anxious: The Success and Struggle of Chinese College Students in American Higher Education&quot; (&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Ambitious and Anxious&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;How Chinese College Students Succeed and Struggle in American Higher Education&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;) &lt;/span>;, describes the status of Chinese students in the United States as &quot;ambition and anxiety coexist.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She found that whether they came from wealthy families or ordinary families, these international students began to experience this contradiction before arriving in the United States, and it intensified after entering college. They have big dreams, but in pursuing their dreams, they experience academic and social struggles and feel confused about their futures. They worry about whether they will be able to earn enough money after graduation to pay off their parents&#39; investment in education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All this takes place against the background of the rapid development of Chinese society. All these anxieties forced them to think about the ultimate question: Is it really worth studying in the United States? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The samples surveyed by Ma Yingyi included 507 Chinese international students from 50 American undergraduate colleges and universities, all born in the 1990s. The survey period was from 2011 to 2019. The book won the 2021 American Association for Comparative and International Education Higher Education Best Book Award and the American Sociological Association’s Bourdieu Book Honor Award. Recently, Ma Yingyi accepted an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The increase in undergraduate international students is not due to the financial crisis&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you pay attention to the group of Chinese international students in American undergraduate education? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My research began in 2011. At that time, major universities in the United States began to have a large number of Chinese undergraduates. Prior to this, most Chinese students studying abroad in the 1980s and 1990s studied in China for graduate school and then went to the United States to study for Ph.D., or they completed their undergraduate studies in China and then went to the United States for graduate school, as was the case for me. Twenty years ago, I first came to the United States after earning my bachelor&#39;s degree in China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But around 2007, a large number of students came to the United States to study for undergraduates after completing high school in China, and some even went directly to the United States to study in high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference is that most of the previous generation of international students either relied on scholarships from the United States to study for master&#39;s or doctoral degrees, or were sponsored by the Chinese government to study in the United States. As for the generation of undergraduates I follow, 90% are completely self-funded. For in-state students, tuition at public universities in the United States is very cheap, but international students have to pay extra, which is higher than out-of-state students, and private universities charge even more. Therefore, whether applying to public or private universities, the cost for Chinese international students is very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my opinion, this is a brand new phenomenon, reflecting the rise of the middle class and the accumulation of wealth in Chinese society. Then during the research process, I gradually discovered the duality of ambition and anxiety among this generation of international students. Whether it is academic or social life, or planning for the future, this contradiction is reflected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Study abroad agencies on the market now recommend that parents study in the United States for their children Prepare for a huge cost of one million a year, which is higher than the cost in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Singapore and other regions. Why are there so many Chinese families willing to pay? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The cost of undergraduate study in the United States may be the highest compared to other regions, so many people mistakenly believe that Chinese students studying in the United States They are all children of entrepreneurs, but in fact they are only a minority. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In sociology, income and wealth are two different concepts. Income is your salary. Judging from income alone, China&#39;s middle class may not be able to afford tuition fees in the United States. But wealth is different. Wealth can include real estate, stocks, etc. In China, it is mainly real estate. Since the 2000s, China&#39;s urbanization has developed rapidly, the housing market has taken off, and many families who are not considered wealthy have also accumulated a certain amount of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the samples I collected, some parents were middle school teachers, and some were even working-class parents. Because they own a house, they choose to liquidate this wealth to support their children&#39;s studies abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do teachers at American universities think of this change? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I once met an administrator at Purdue University. He said that the school had a financial crisis after the 2008 financial crisis. It just so happened that Chinese undergraduates arrived at this time and had the ability to pay high tuition fees. He described it as a &quot;perfect marriage.&quot; At that time, I discovered that this was a very systematic phenomenon, and there were not only needs from both parties behind it, so I started researching it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The increase in international undergraduate students studying in the United States is due to the Financial crisis? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Many people say that the increase in Chinese students came after the financial crisis in 2008, when American universities were short of money. But my survey data shows that the year with the highest annual growth rate in the number of Chinese students studying in the United States was 2007, before the financial crisis. Therefore, it is not the demand from American universities that has led to the rapid increase in Chinese students studying abroad, but more the demand from the Chinese middle class and above for their children’s education. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, China experienced rapid economic development, the rise of the middle class, and residents&#39; income also increased rapidly. Another factor I mention in the book is the appreciation of the renminbi from 2006 to 2014. By 2014, the renminbi had appreciated by about 37%, making Chinese households more able to pay. On the other hand, it is still very difficult to get into good universities in China, and the United States is still the place with the largest concentration of good universities in the world, so many people come to the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Three stages have &quot;ambition and anxiety coexisting&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did your research develop? How do you observe the &quot;coexistence of ambition and anxiety&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My survey started in 2011. I initially used a sampling method to conduct an online survey, and then selected students who were willing to participate in in-depth interviews. We received 507 questionnaires from 50 institutions, and finally conducted in-depth interviews with 65 Chinese students who studied undergraduate in the United States from 2013 to 2016. I let students choose English or Chinese, and almost everyone speaks Chinese. Over the next three years, I conducted fieldwork in nine high schools in six cities in China and interviewed school counselors, principals, and teachers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I divide their experience into three stages. The first stage is before students come to the United States, they need to prepare for applications, exams, and school selection. The whole process is full of anxiety. This largely comes from their ambition, because they want to enter the top 30 or top 50 schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second stage is to choose a major. I have to choose a job that satisfies my interests and is easy to find a job. This is where conflicts with my parents begin to arise. They are also anxious during the social stage. Chinese students are very unfamiliar with American students’ social and entertainment methods, making it difficult to integrate. The purpose of many students going abroad is to get in touch with diverse cultures and different circles, so this also brings a lot of pressure and a sense of gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final stage is planning for the future. When I did my research, the job market was not what it is now, but there were all kinds of problems. For example, if you want to stay in the United States, you have visa issues. When you return to China, you have difficulty integrating into domestic circles, how to use domestic social capital, and how to choose a career. They are also eager to get satisfactory returns on their academic qualifications and experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This duality of &quot;ambition and anxiety&quot; can be clearly observed in these three stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Compared with international students from other countries, Chinese students have this kind of Will duality be more prominent? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Any international student will face this situation. Specifically, when it comes to Chinese students studying abroad, many of them sell their homes or take out loans to support their children studying abroad. Most of this generation are only children, and many of them need to return to their parents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, from a philosophical perspective, ambition itself can generate anxiety. But Chinese international students are more prominent in this regard. During the writing process, I realized that to understand this generation of international students, it is actually very important to understand the Chinese society behind them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past two decades, Chinese society has actually been a state of coexistence of ambition and anxiety. No country has changed as much as China. People from all walks of life have felt many changes. Many people have achieved prosperity and many people have great aspirations and ambitions. People&#39;s horizons have broadened and their incomes have increased. At the same time, they are always worried about what opportunities they have missed. They are eager to gain an international perspective, but this requires a lot of resources. People have also begun to worry about whether their investment can obtain sufficient returns. All this brings Come to anxiety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same is naturally true for Chinese students coming from this environment. Moreover, international students are not a random group of people in any society. They are a group of people with ambitions and certain privileges. Sociologically speaking, migrant populations are more ambitious and goal-oriented than migrant populations. International students want to study to get a degree and see the wider world. They even bear the expectations and eyes of the entire family, and bear the pressure and opportunities brought about by social changes. Opportunities and challenges coexist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, although China&#39;s society has undergone tremendous changes, education has not changed that much. The main reason is that the college entrance examination is still the baton. The primary and secondary education received by Chinese children and American children is very different. Chinese students go to American higher education with the imprint of Chinese education. This change itself also brings great challenges to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, Chinese international students may be the group with the most &quot;dual nature of ambition and anxiety&quot; among the international student groups in the world, or among the floating population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/K6zJfahPg7LyzIdrNINGBRE3Bv747eqJGNgtyTJY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1007&quot; height= &quot;764&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/K6zJfahPg7LyzIdrNINGBRE3Bv747eqJGNgtyTJY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255945&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Left: &quot;Ambition and Worry: The Successes and Struggles of Chinese College Students in American Higher Education.&quot; Right: Ma Yingyi, professor of sociology at Syracuse University, USA. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Encountering a &quot;sense of gap&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You also mentioned in your book that after some Chinese students come to the United States, they will be troubled because their school is in a &quot;village&quot; Shock? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The most famous case is the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which everyone says is a cornfield. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has a lot to do with the history of the development of higher education in China and the United States. Chinese universities are concentrated in big cities, while in the United States there are actually not many big cities, but there are many university towns, which are schools built in large rural areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each state has its own flagship school, and the top QS-ranked schools are not necessarily in big cities. Of course, university rankings are one-sided and easily misleading information. Universities in the United States are very diverse. There are very good academic colleges and community colleges in public schools. Different schools have different missions. They are not strictly superior or inferior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why do international students value university rankings so much? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One reason is that the admissions system in the United States is very different. It does not only look at scores. You don’t know what proportion the scores will account for. , there is no way to quantitatively determine whether it is 10%, 5%, or 90%. Every school is different, every major is different, and every school is different in different years. No one will tell you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;American students may choose this school for various reasons such as good results in a certain sport, the school being close to home, or even the beautiful scenery. But Chinese students don’t understand this, and university rankings have become a source of stress and anxiety for them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Among your interviewees, this &quot;sense of gap&quot; still exists In what ways does it appear? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The sense of gap in life, including interpersonal communication. They may have thought Americans were warm and open, but later discovered that making friends was not as easy as they thought. For example, some students were ambitious at first and hoped to make many American friends, but they were quickly frustrated. A very important way of social entertainment for American college students is weekend parties. Many people at the party drink and play some drinking games, such as putting a ping pong ball on a beer bottle and everyone blows it together. Whoever the ball hits gets a drink. . Many Chinese children cannot join in, and many find drinking games unbearable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people feel frustrated and return to the circle of Chinese students. The entertainment in this circle may be eating together, singing at KTV, girls going shopping, and boys playing games. Many Chinese students will feel that I should not hang out with Chinese people when I go abroad. Their parents will even urge them to make American friends, saying, &quot;If you don&#39;t make American friends, your English will not be as good as before you went abroad.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a Chinese student who speaks English very well, is outgoing, and has many American friends. Everyone thinks he grew up in the United States. However, after he integrated into the circle of American college students, he was disappointed. He did not enjoy the multiculturalism as he had imagined before, so he returned to the circle of Chinese people, assuming leadership positions in the Chinese international student group and hosting the Spring Festival Gala. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think this is a very interesting return. I went out for a while, had my imagination shattered, and then came back. In a philosophical sense, this return is a process of finding oneself. Although he finally returned to the Chinese students, he came out to see, interact with, and experience a different world, which was different from the one he had originally The state of not going out is completely different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do they adapt to this &quot;sense of gap&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This sense of gap will affect their satisfaction with studying abroad and will affect their entire state, including study, social interaction, daily life, etc. , in fact, it is difficult to adapt. But time itself brings habits, and students who have never been accustomed to it may choose to leave. For example, some students&#39; undergraduate schools are in large rural areas in the United States. After graduation, they will apply to study for graduate students in big cities such as New York and Boston. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, you still need to deepen your understanding of yourself and the new environment. Before studying abroad, you should first understand what you really want, what the school can provide, and try to reduce some misunderstandings. Only in this way can you reduce the problems caused by misunderstandings in the future. Come with dissatisfaction and anxiety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is very beneficial to make some preparations to adapt to the environment. For example, a student whose family conditions are relatively good, his parents found him an American friend on Twitter to accompany him to practice speaking, communicate and communicate with him. Some students will go to American schools in advance to adapt to the environment. I also did some statistical analysis and found that participating in more club activities, participating in school organizations, etc. can improve students&#39; satisfaction with studying abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to daily life, international students do not speak in class and it is difficult to integrate well Classroom and academic activities have actually always been a problem. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;They may really want to express themselves and participate, but it is difficult for them to participate. This situation of not getting what you want actually brings a lot of psychological burden. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have personal experience with classroom discussions. I often ask my classmates to discuss in class. Discussions are not entirely a challenge to English communication. Language is the most basic threshold. Many students who are very good at English also find it difficult to participate in discussions. My survey shows that 60% of students think that their English is very good, but only 20%-30% of all students think that they often speak in class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What factors are holding them back? I think a very important reason is the difference in basic thinking patterns, and students cannot express themselves bravely and fully. Most Chinese classrooms are always looking for standard answers, and students are always worried about whether what they say is right. In contrast, American university classes are open-ended discussions with no right answers. This is a considerable difference. Chinese students need to change their thinking patterns to participate effectively in discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Leverage strengths and avoid weaknesses, rather than make up for gaps&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This book was published in 2020.

It is inconvenient to travel and they are far away from their families. It should be said that Chinese international students are in a worse situation. difficulty. My basic conclusion has not changed, but these three years have clearly made &quot;worrying&quot; worse. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you understand &quot;worried&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The specific challenge is uncertainty, which is reflected in all aspects of studying abroad. When will flights be added? Would it be easier to return home? Why are student visas and work visas so difficult to apply for? U.S. policies and public opinion trends will increase the psychological pressure on Chinese students. This is a pressure that Chinese students did not have 10 years ago. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, when I wrote this book, there seemed to be a very consistent tendency to choose the United States, but now many students have chosen Europe, Japan, including Hong Kong, China, etc. This is a relatively big change. . Recently released data shows that the number of Indian students in the United States has exceeded that of Chinese students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the trend of younger students studying abroad? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;More and more families are choosing to send their young children to study abroad. This may be due to structural reasons. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the elimination system of standardized tests, most people are not winners. Although some students have become winners, in this competitive environment, they are unable to obtain a more balanced physical and mental development, or they are unhappy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So many families choose to study abroad at a young age. Obviously everyone knows that there are risks. Compared with college students, the risks are higher. However, after analyzing the risks and rewards, they feel that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, so they make the decision. This choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What suggestions do you have for Chinese international students and parents? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Yingyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The most important thing is to learn more about yourself through various methods. For example, through parents, friends, or by participating in various activities to understand yourself more comprehensively. Studying abroad actually just opens a window. After arriving, you have to make many choices, including which courses to take, which societies to join, what future path to choose, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A great advantage of American higher education is that it provides many choices. For a person to make a choice that suits him or her, a very important prerequisite is self-awareness. So you need to understand yourself, what your strengths are, what your weaknesses are, what you are passionate about, and what abilities you cannot develop. One person cannot be good at everything. The most important thing in modern society is to do things that you are good at and interested in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It doesn’t matter if you don’t know yourself well. I think this is a lifelong lesson. But students should have this awareness now, and start focusing on their own interests and strengths from now on, making use of their strengths and avoiding weaknesses, rather than making up for gaps. I think both students and parents need to make adjustments in their thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以舆论战开打，以色列缘何撤销公共外交部？丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259553]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 22, 2023 local time, the Israeli cabinet decided to revoke the country’s main responsibility for public diplomacy through a telephone vote. , the Ministry of Information for External Propaganda Affairs (generally referred to as the &quot;Public Ministry of Foreign Affairs&quot; in news reports), and said that the ministry&#39;s budget will be transferred to the recovery and reconstruction of communities around the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a gesture by the Israeli government directed at both its domestic public and the international community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abolish the so-called inaction departments internally, find scapegoats, and try to homogenize domestic public opinion. It has demonstrated its determination to burn its boats to the outside world, and any attempt by the outside world to interfere with Israel&#39;s will will be rejected. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What does the dissolution of the Ministry of Public Affairs mean? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The term &quot;public diplomacy&quot; was first proposed by Professor Edmund Glean of Tufts University in the United States in 1965. He believed that public diplomacy is to ensure that one&#39;s own country maintains effective relations with foreign countries. Thought connection”. More generally speaking, public diplomacy is a strategic plan to carry out national marketing and create a positive and good international image. It is a &quot;popular project&quot; to win the hearts and minds of the international people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, Israel directly announced the immediate dissolution of the Ministry of Public Affairs. It is obvious that it has deeply felt the changes in international public opinion. Israel’s external propaganda department cannot escape the blame for this, although Israel is doing a positive job The battlefield has an overwhelming advantage, but the corresponding situation is not shown on the battlefield of public opinion. The reasons behind this are worthy of scrutiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, global public opinion has embarrassed Israel, which not only seriously interferes with Israel&#39;s upcoming retaliatory actions, but also has the potential to further weaken Israel&#39;s internal unity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this atmosphere, Minister of Public Foreign Affairs Atbaryan&#39;s voluntary resignation not only gave herself a step down, but also showed her support for the Netanyahu government. She said, &quot;Put aside Self-deprecation aside, running a ministry in such a horrific time of war is an expensive problem and the Israeli people need every shekel.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 12, the latest opinion poll conducted by the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; showed that nearly four-fifths of the people believe that the Netanyahu government needs to deal with this large-scale Hamas infiltration and Responsible for the massacre of Jews, the Israeli government must not only unite internally and externally at this moment, but also consider a potential post-war political reckoning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, Israel’s internal struggles remain complex and changeable, which has profoundly affected Israel’s security environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israeli media pointed out that the Ministry of Public Affairs not only failed to fulfill its obligations, but even interfered in Israel&#39;s internal affairs for a long period of time. This minister from the Likud Party has used his power to vigorously promote the government&#39;s judicial reform and made a series of inflammatory remarks. For example, in April 2023, Atbaryan directly pointed out that the military, police and media composed of The deep state network is working hard to overthrow the government, which is reminiscent of how the Turkish government described the Gulen movement before the attempted coup in 2016, highlighting that the Israeli state and society are gradually being torn apart. In addition, she has launched scar-revealing attacks on her political critics, underscoring her right-wing conservative ultra-hardline political stance, which runs counter to Israel&#39;s desire to be diplomatic in its international propaganda matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, on October 12, before the department was disintegrated, she issued a resignation statement, saying that the power of her department had been weakened, and there was an overlap of powers between the Ministry of Expatriate Affairs and the Ministry of Public Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs only received its budget six months after the new government was formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first cabinet member to resign after a new round of conflict between Palestine and Israel broke out. This is just a microcosm of Israel’s domestic struggle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Palestinian-Israeli conflict, analyzed only from a technical level and from an absolutely neutral political stance, has greatly shocked Israel. It is comparable in form to the Fourth Middle East War and in terms of psychological trauma. Compared with the &quot;9·11&quot; incident in the United States. This is not unrelated to the division of domestic public opinion caused by Israel&#39;s promotion of judicial reform in the past year. The root cause is the long-standing dispute between left and right, religious and secular disputes in Israel&#39;s internal affairs, as well as the frequent changes of governments in recent years. hidden fundamental crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the saying goes, fortresses are breached from within. Israel’s recent political chaos has seriously affected its military and intelligence systems, giving Hamas room to take advantage of the situation. In addition, the peace process between Israel and Saudi Arabia About to enter its final chapter, Hamas urgently needs to give the international community a heavy blow and prove to the world that Middle East reconciliation that bypasses the Palestinian-Israeli issue is putting the cart before the horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the dissolution of the Ministry of Public Affairs heralds the imminence of a larger-scale bloody operation. Israel is consolidating all resources and preparing for war. Israel&#39;s domestic thinking in fighting Palestine urgently needs to form a united front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel’s move is also preparing for the worst for the safety of the hostages, that is, it ignores the hostage weight in the hands of Hamas, ignores domestic and foreign voices in favor of reconciliation negotiations, and treats Hamas the possibility of a complete liquidation. But this is undoubtedly a difficult decision. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the Israeli border are hesitant. During Biden&#39;s visit, he issued &quot;Advice to Israel&quot; and so on. These all prove that the large-scale ground war against Gaza will not only affect Israel&#39;s The international image is more likely to cause further division within Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The situation on the battlefield of public opinion is tense&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a medium for public diplomacy and a window for understanding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the importance of public opinion is self-evident. With the many conflicts that have broken out in recent years Similarly, the public opinion field is the second battlefield opened by all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, various advanced technological means, such as 5G, streaming media, artificial intelligence and mobile-based social media networks, have made the battlefield of public opinion mixed, making it difficult to distinguish between true and false, and the situation is changing rapidly, which has brought about The &quot;information tide&quot; has a strong ability to induce and differentiate positions and values ​​and create opposing emotions for the public who lack certain professional knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the public opinion war in this Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it has the following three major characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the mature development of streaming media and online live broadcast technology has given global audiences a stronger audio-visual impact on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The timeliness and impact of information dissemination have greatly increased, and it has also provided opportunities for the proliferation of false information. It has provided a breeding ground for various conspiracy theories, historical-realistic information confusion and propaganda, and fake accounts and robot trolls have emerged one after another on social media. While expanding attention, it has also set off a confrontation between the two factions around the world. These include positional opposition (supporting Israel or supporting Pakistan), religious opposition (Judaism and Islam), ethnic opposition (Arabs and Jews), and intra-sect opposition (moderate factions exist within both Arabs and Jews). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Hamas launched its attack, it used heavy bulldozers to break through the Gaza separation wall and carry out bloody killings inside the Israeli border posts. The video was broadcast live on the Internet. This video set off a new wave of sectarianism in the Arab world. , nationalistic sentiments, but also directly angered groups sympathetic to Jews. It is precisely because of the popularity of the Internet and mobile devices that war has achieved a certain form of visibility and transparency, and has become a hotbed and soil for breeding public opinion wars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, when the Western media reported on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the wording was the Israel-Hamas War, not the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. This highlights the asymmetric nature of the conflict and is a precautionary endorsement of a potential high-intensity Israeli military strike. Hidden behind this is the challenge to the loopholes in international law and the laws of war. Because the laws of war are applicable to sovereign states, the Israeli Defense Forces&#39; attack on Hamas is most likely to be a &quot;police-like war.&quot; Such a narrative will also separate the public from the perspective of ethnic and religious conflicts. The legitimacy of the war on terrorism is obviously greater than the battle for territory. It can be seen that the inclusion of stance in narrative strategies is an eternal pattern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the public opinion war in this conflict has typical sinking and spillover effects. This conflict has transcended the conflicts between Palestine and Israel and Kazakhstan and Israel, and has shown a trend of spillover and camp formation. Currently, both sides are working hard to seek legitimacy for the war, and have moved from the level of international authoritative media to the level of mass entertainment media. The two sides are competing for the right to speak across the air in other countries. This is not common in previous war conflicts, but it is inevitable for the vigorous development of modern information technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, after Israel announced the dissolution of its Public Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it has in a sense reaped the consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 24, Hamas publicly released two old Israeli women. A video of them shaking hands with masked Hamas members and saying goodbye went viral on social platforms, and they later faced dozens of reporters. , the released elderly people said that Hamas treated them very friendly and responded to their requests. The accounts of those who have witnessed it are extremely impactful, which has compressed the public opinion space in Israel now and even for a long time in the future, and also caused doubts in the Israeli media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The game between Palestine and Israel has never stopped when narrating the war. The mutual siege is not only a portrayal of the real battlefield, but also a manifestation of online public opinion. This is a microcosm of the structural contradiction between Palestine and Israel in the field of international political communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;(The author Yang Fuxin is an assistant researcher at the Institute of Environmental Studies at Zhejiang International Studies University; Ma Xiaolin is a professor at Zhejiang International Studies University and an environmental Director of the Mediterranean Institute)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[难以推开的石门，看完很扎心]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259513]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 22:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;In recent years, female-themed works have exploded, but most of them Focusing on the plight of urban women, there are still very few films with small town women as protagonists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stone Gate&quot;, which was recently released on streaming media, is a precious image of the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/24e847a87b538a5e8d415b57418b1a23.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/24e847a87b538a5e8d415b57418b1a23.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255861&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;01&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;The directors of &quot;Stone Gate&quot; are rising independent film stars Huang Ji and Otsuka Ryuji, who are a husband-and-wife team.

&lt;p>;‍这其中，我们能明显感觉到，女孩林森对于生活以及新生命的麻木感，那种缺乏生机的呆滞与迷茫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;影片高频率出现的静态镜头，也进一步渲染了这种寂静的绝望感。 ‍&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/1ef6b320b255e6460e3af6748f2b2bc5.png&quot;

&lt;p>;林森的情绪很少外露，即便男友要求打胎时，她也没有吵闹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但孕期一次次胸部胀痛，生产分娩时的撕裂，林森艰难忍受的表情和声音又告诉我们她的痛苦的确存在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/dfe1e9a335889ec1e3d9fb2d86323882.gif&quot;

&lt;p>;在痛苦与迷茫中，她一步步失去了命运的主导权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;03&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;《石门》的故事情节不算复杂，但影片长达147分钟，因为导演把不少镜头放在了社会景观上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在很多场景里，林森不参与主要叙事，作为一种背景板出现，成了一个静默的观察者。 ‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如她会旁观男友拍摄抖音婚庆宣传视频，看地下产业的经理露骨地面试年轻女孩。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;展现小城镇女性的影视作品，虽然近些年比较稀缺，但前些年不算少见。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;优秀作品能在把握女性叙事和社会文化景观上维持住绝佳的平衡。暂且不提第四代第五代导演们的经典代表作品，比如《秋菊打官司》《人鬼情》《立春》等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里举例一部冷门佳作——《哭泣的女人》，这部电影的导演兼编剧刘冰鉴，借靠哭丧挣钱的贵州女子王桂香的故事，向大众展示了中国由来已久的丧葬文化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/e041e619ee4d45eb63a62f887f45b33c.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;639&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/e041e619ee4d45eb63a62f887f45b33c.gif&quot;

&lt;p>;林森父母饰演者就是导演黄骥的亲爸妈，现实里就经营着这家诊所，家也是导演夫妇真实的住所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/16048330511b15c4fd902365660c13e4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;长沙作为主要取景地，镜头捕捉了它光鲜繁华的一面，也拍到了混乱灰暗的角落。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/3e41d5118d476d174812674e0747a397.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot;

&lt;p>;女主角林森原本的设定是一个想象出来的积极主动的女大学生形象。但这和演员姚红贵当时的状态截然不同，和很多年轻大学生的现状也有出入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;导演夫妇便改写了人设，主角故事则是采访得来的女大学生混合经历。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;借由一个小城镇女孩的意外怀孕遭遇，影片折射这一群体的结构性困境。它源自于父权主义、商品社会、权力阶层等多方面的束缚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/e3ba2cfb0a66e49d2831ae5de02d63df.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;565&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/e3ba2cfb0a66e49d2831ae5de02d63df.png&quot;

triggered a &quot;storm in a teacup&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was first reported online that on October 24, the police from Wusong District, Shanghai came to the door and seized a 16-year-old German shepherd. The owner surrenders the dog. In the videos and texts circulating on the Internet, the dog has become a &quot;retired police dog&quot; or even a &quot;retired military dog.&quot; The words &quot;18 special police officers in three vehicles broke down the door and caught a 16-year-old dying old dog&quot;. Hot search. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 24, the Shanghai Wusong Subdistrict Office issued a notice on this matter. The report stated that a resident of Haibin San Village was raising large and aggressive dogs (wolfdogs with hybrid blood) without a license, and had repeatedly walked dogs without leashes and large dogs without muzzles and other illegal dog-raising behaviors. After receiving reports from surrounding residents, police officers from the police station, staff from the Dog Breeding Office, comprehensive law enforcement officials and the district&#39;s special police detachment jointly came to rectify the situation. The dog owner took the initiative to open the door and cooperated with the work, and took the initiative to hand over the dog to the relevant departments for containment and disposal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After careful review of this incident, there are many contradictions and inconsistencies between the information transmitted online and the official report. Even after the report was released, many people expressed &quot;disbelief&quot; and need to be analyzed one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;bloodline&quot; of the dog involved. Someone on Weibo said it was a retired police dog, but the &quot;uniform&quot; in the video posted online only had &quot;POLICE&quot; in English and no Chinese &quot;police dog&quot;. This is obviously inconsistent with the &quot;standard dress&quot; of domestic police dogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that the first batch of retired police dogs in Shanghai were opened for adoption on September 5, 2022. The eight police dogs announced at that time were all from the police dog training base of the Songjiang Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. Bradford, Malinois, Rottweiler, Springer Spaniel, German Shepherd, Doberman, etc., but only one Springer Spaniel and two Labradors are open to the public for adoption, and the remaining five including the German Shepherd are retired Police dogs can only be adopted by units. At the same time, adoptive citizens also need to receive follow-up visits every three months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, there is indeed a German Shepherd among the retired police dogs open for adoption in Shanghai, but it was not given to citizens for adoption. Therefore, the rumors that the dogs involved were just &quot;retired police dogs&quot; and &quot;German shepherds&quot; are self-defeating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;retired military dog&quot; theory, there is a lack of any supporting information, and it directly conflicts with the &quot;POLICE uniform&quot; in the online video. China&#39;s &quot;Interim Regulations on the Work of Military Dogs&quot; defines military dogs as special combatants and an integral part of the military&#39;s combat effectiveness. After military dogs retire, they will generally enter military dog ​​breeding and training bases to &quot;live out their old age&quot;. Military dogs with meritorious service will also enjoy recuperation treatment. Even if adoption is open, adopters have very high requirements, including &quot;must love dogs&quot;, &quot;must have experience raising large dogs&quot;, and &quot;cannot be a living environment in an urban community&quot;. Some units will also require adopters to have Military personnel will vouch for them, and they must have a stable income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &quot;Zhengzhou 10 million reward for finding retired military dogs&quot; incident on July 9, 2023, the &quot;retired military dog&quot; gimmick instantly proved that this is a &quot;starting picture, the rest are all It’s fake news, because the description in the “reward notice” is completely contrary to the regulations for the adoption of retired military dogs. In this incident, the terms &quot;retired police dog&quot; and &quot;retired military dog&quot; are inconsistent and can be proven to be pure rumors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, whether the dog owner’s dog-raising behavior is legal and compliant, and the truth behind the door-to-door rectification actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 12, paragraph 3, of the &quot;Shanghai Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot; passed in 2011 and revised in 2016, prohibits individuals from raising aggressive dogs. Violators of this provision will have the aggressive dogs taken into custody by the public security department. The &quot;Shanghai Catalog of Prohibited Individual Breeding of Violent Dogs&quot; stipulates 24 types of ferocious dogs, including German Shepherds, French Wolfdogs, and Kunming Wolfdogs. Therefore, whether the owner of the dog involved adopts a German shepherd or a hybrid wolfdog, it is undoubtedly a violent dog breed that is prohibited from personal breeding, and dog registration, annual inspection and dog management fees are out of the question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the official report, the owner of the dog involved also engaged in illegal dog-raising behaviors such as walking the dog without a leash and without wearing a muzzle. This is also consistent with the &quot;20 reports from surrounding residents&quot; in the online information. The statement is consistent. Articles 21 and 30 of the &quot;Shanghai Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot; also clearly stipulate that dog owners shall abide by public order and shall not interfere with the normal lives of others. Residents&#39; committees also have the right to formulate and supervise dog breeding conventions or regulations in their residential areas. Management, dog owners should comply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that the illegal dog-raising behavior of the dog owner involved has been confirmed, surrounding residents naturally have the right to report and request the public security department to take in the dog. This request is reasonable and reasonable, and the joint door-to-door rectification by various local departments is also in line with current laws and regulations. Judging from the live videos and pictures, &quot;18 special police officers&quot; is also false information, and relevant social media bloggers have deliberately exaggerated it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, this incident also shows that relevant public issues have lost focus, which may not be a blessing to the public interest. Faced with the public issue of &quot;how to regulate dog ownership,&quot; some people are willing to mobilize by creating fake news and create traffic and attention with &quot;tragic narratives.&quot; Similar behavior is no longer a public discussion, but an out-and-out &quot;information war&quot; and &quot;public opinion war&quot; method, trying to blur the focus and muddy the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, laws and regulations regulating dog breeding have been implemented in various places for many years, in order to better protect people&#39;s rights. Dogs are not civil subjects and are the private property of their owners. &quot;Conflict between humans and dogs&quot; is a false issue that does not exist. The real issue is how to regulate dog breeding: only when the premise of protecting human rights is established can we talk about protecting people&#39;s property rights to dogs. Protecting people from being hurt by dogs and preventing &quot;dog bites&quot; should still be a real issue that public opinion pays attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[官方通报深圳欢乐谷过山车碰撞事故救治情况：目前17人留院诊治]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259549]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 21:08:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/icPBcDeRPzTXeytRVvcAgxDLzedBlJx77ZIA0HT2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;821&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/icPBcDeRPzTXeytRVvcAgxDLzedBlJx77ZIA0HT2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[社会总要“毒打”每一个准社会人丨 记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259535]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/29/o2oKFU2EiDUXRbLqoSU8L1WMxan6W8ITAbEXeCc5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;880&quot; height=&quot;658&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/o2oKFU2EiDUXRbLqoSU8L1WMxan6W8ITAbEX eCc5. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255940&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, 2023, Guangzhou, the theme of the South China University of Technology was &quot;Shenzhen It is a double-selection meeting of the &quot;State-owned Enterprises 2024 Campus Recruitment&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Ke Yule/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Details of relevant reports See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/258798?source=131&quot;>;&quot;Who is in the cold?&quot; Who&#39;s popular? The first job fair for the Class of 2024&quot;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a journalism student, when interviewing job fairs, I pay special attention to the situation of media units. However, after the four double-election meetings, I only saw one news website from Foshan, which was on September 28, 2023, at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The HR of this news website used the pseudonym Huang Li in the manuscript. After a brief introduction, I was allowed to sit aside and ask questions or observe on the spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a form on the table to record the basic information of job-seeking students. Nearly three hours have passed since the double selection meeting, and about twenty names have been filled in. The next column is &quot;Education,&quot; almost all of which are master&#39;s degrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I heard that Guangzhou Foreign Studies University (graduated this year) has 150 master&#39;s degrees in new communication.&quot; When she said this, Huang Li had a subtle smile on her face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seven minutes ago, she just rejected a girl&#39;s resume on the grounds that &quot;the resume was not suitable.&quot; A girl wants to apply for the social media platform operation of a news network, but she only has user operation experience in an ordinary company. It’s hard to tell what the essential difference between the two “operations” is, but it doesn’t prevent Huang Li from thinking that they don’t match each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I speculate that what she meant was that there were many students applying for jobs and she could choose as much as she wanted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In media reports, the number of graduates has been rising year after year - 9.09 million in 2021, 10.76 million in 2022, and 11.58 million in 2023 - making each year replace the previous year and become a new &quot; The most difficult employment season.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following interview with Xu Yang, the organizer of the double election conference, confirmed this point. He told me that in recent years, the supply and demand for jobs at the double election have become increasingly asymmetric. On the one hand, students&#39; enthusiasm for employment is actually increasing and the number of participants is increasing; on the other hand, the number of participating companies and the number of jobs released is decreasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jiamin, a master’s degree student in materials science from Sun Yat-sen University who has been mentioned in many reports, was someone I met at South China University of Technology. At that time, she was sitting outside the venue and resting against the wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Across the wall, countless red posters hang low, and there are one or two nervous-looking HRs in front of each booth. The aisles were narrow and cluttered, leaflets scattered everywhere, and it was dark and stuffy, like a trench. Li Jiamin smiled bitterly: &quot;Looking for a job requires physical and psychological torture.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employment is indeed like a battle, and everyone is prepared. But after each battle, it seems that everyone has lost their armor and lost their armor, with no victory or defeat in sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the bathroom of the same double election meeting, I also saw a young HR with a childish look on his face. She was still breastfeeding and asked me in a low voice to help close the outer door of the toilet. I was secretly surprised by how hard he worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the manuscript was released, Li Jiamin’s demands for salary were considered by some readers as “having not withstood the severe beatings of society”. Like a motto of the times, society always wants to “beat” every (quasi) social person. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Isn’t it normal for job seekers to want higher wages and better jobs? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, companies also have their own grievances. When Huang Li commented on today&#39;s young job seekers, her dissatisfaction could not be concealed in her words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For those of us who were born in the 1980s and early 1990s, our family conditions were not that good when we were young, so we all consciously cherished our jobs. But today’s young people have good family conditions, have no worries about food and drink, and have many choices of work. A lot. For them, the boss doesn’t fight against the west, right? As long as there is something that doesn’t fit the idea, just leave.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to improve the so-called recruitment retention rate, the job seeker’s hometown It became a question she repeatedly asked. From whether she is from Foshan, to whether she has relatives and friends living in Foshan, to her identification with the city of Foshan, she did not let go of any clues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Feng, who was at the same double selection meeting as Huang Li, is the head of the Guangzhou branch of a public examination training institution. On this day, his booth was almost always surrounded by people. This is very unusual for a small and micro enterprise with less than 50 employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is difficult to tell whether the crowd who gathered around him was attracted by the several &quot;Guangdong Written Examination Questions for Selected Students&quot; on the table or by the institution itself.

Becoming the murderer who personally caused the death of a child? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than 20 years, Japanese writer and journalist Haru Sugiyama has continued to investigate cases of parental abandonment in Japan. In many cases of abandonment that shocked society, young children eventually starved to death because they had no ability to take care of themselves. Or die of illness. These cases are driving the revision of Japan&#39;s Child Protection Act, but the situation of deaths due to abandonment remains serious. &quot;Most of the parents who have lost their children seem to be young people, prejudiced people or people with disabilities.&quot; In October 2023, 65-year-old Haru Sugiyama told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; in an email interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After children are born, does the world provide them with a safe and protected growth environment? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022 alone, 77 children died of abuse in Japan. Data from the Japan Children and Family Agency show that the number of child abuse consultations in Japan in 2022 has set a new record for 32 consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 23, 2023, a case involving the death of an abandoned baby was opened in Japan. 33-year-old Narumi Taniguchi, who works in a custom shop, gave birth to a baby girl alone on a street in Osaka City on January 30. She put the baby in a bag and abandoned it in a coin-operated locker. The baby eventually died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, the South Korean police discovered the remains of two infants in a refrigerator in an apartment in Suwon City. This incident attracted great attention in South Korea. South Korea&#39;s Ministry of Health and Welfare stated that as of July 18, there were more than 2,123 unregistered &quot;ghost babies&quot; in South Korea, and 249 of them were confirmed dead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What initially led Haru Sugiyama to investigate the phenomenon of &quot;child abandonment&quot; was a death case of a girl that shocked Japanese society. On December 10, 2000, a girl died in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. A pair of young parents put their 3-year-old daughter Mana Murata in a cardboard box at home for nearly 20 days. During this period, Mana barely ate, she eventually starved to death. At that time, Masami Murata, a mother, was pregnant and raising a 1-and-a-half-year-old son with her husband Tomonori Murata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugiyama Haru graduated from the First Faculty of Literature of Waseda University. He worked as a magazine editor and later became a freelancer. He writes reportage about parenting and parent-child issues, parents killing their own children, etc. His works include focusing on women. The poverty-stricken &quot;Documentary·Abuse - The Case of Two Children Abandoned to Death in Osaka&quot;, &quot;Thoughts from Child Abuse: How Society Pressures Families&quot; which explores the seriousness of family relationships in Japanese society, and &quot;Parenting Abandonment - Trapped Mothers&quot; The Chinese version of &quot;With the Neglected Daughter&quot; will be published in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SLJxrzToY7rJMxC11QGsHQ2fvLN081Dr1nnwGzrk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SLJxrzToY7rJMxC11QGsHQ2fvLN081Dr1nnwGzrk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255435&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugiyama Haru met the Muratas while they were serving their sentences and continued to correspond with them. Sugiyama Haru&#39;s child is one and a half years older than Mana. During the investigation, Sugiyama Haru &quot;the closer he came into contact with the case, the more unable he was to escape from his mother&#39;s perspective.&quot; After three and a half years of interviews and research on this case, Haru Sugiyama finally recorded this tragedy caused by the parenting environment in modern society in a way that is close to line drawing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother who abandoned her daughter was also a daughter who was abandoned since she was a child. In Japanese society with structural gender inequality, women&#39;s own needs are always ignored. When her daughter Mana&#39;s health condition worsened, Masami turned to her husband Tomonori for help. After being treated indifferently, the frustrated Masami no longer cared about her daughter&#39;s condition, but turned to her own mother Hideko, and flattered her husband who had already remarried. The mother expressed her love passionately and tried hard to imitate a &quot;well-behaved daughter in her mother&#39;s eyes.&quot; The 24-year-old Yamei was afraid of her haggard child and did not dare to touch her daughter, waiting for her child to die in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a society where mothers assume the main childcare responsibilities by default, lack of social awareness of childcare, and economic inequality, the tragedy of young children dying due to abuse and abandonment is not an isolated case. The circumstances and details in the &quot;Mana&quot; case have appeared repeatedly in subsequent &quot;childcare abandonment&quot; cases. The parents of these children often suffered violence or abandonment when they were young. They grew up in isolation. As adults, they still face tremendous pressure to survive and lack the ability to live stably in society. Haru Sugiyama said: &quot;Twenty years of continuous interviews have given me the feeling that cases of death by abuse are also affected by the contraction of social functions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BBiMfnmVj1JPaa4U1MSOG6MhKdmSSDILBNSDxy9o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/10/25/BBiMfnmVj1JPaa4U1MSOG6MhKdmSSDILBNSDxy9o.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is an interview between &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; and Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unable to Why don’t parents raising children seek help? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From the 1990s to the present, Japan’s &quot;childcare abandonment&quot; &quot;How has the phenomenon changed?&quot; What kind of fluctuations have the incidence rate shown, and what are the social and temporal reasons behind it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Currently, about 70 cases of killing children occur in Japanese society every year. Of course, in the period of social chaos after the war, children suffered even more. In the second half of the 1970s, there were approximately 200 cases of child abuse-related death each year. In the first half of the 1970s, in Japan, which was experiencing rapid economic growth, cases of babies being thrown into lockers at train stations often occurred. That was an era when a large number of young people moved from rural areas to cities. Such cases occurred frequently, probably because the society at that time did not provide cultural and institutional support for families. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have been paying attention to &quot;nurturing&quot; since the 1990s Children” topic, especially the phenomenon of “parenting abandonment” or improper parenting in Japan. What is the general appearance of the families you met during your research, such as their economic status? Are they all from the bottom of society? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Haru Sugiyama:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I interviewed six families that were torn apart by child abuse. Some of the children in these families were abused to death, and some were on the verge of death. . Some of the interviews involved me meeting directly with family members, while others I simply attended court proceedings. Objectively speaking, the families I interviewed were all facing financial difficulties. Even if they do not fall into the low-income group defined by society, these families are still in considerable financial difficulty. In addition, parents who lose their children seem to be more likely to be young, prejudiced, or disabled. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Childcare requires an investment of resources. British urban anthropologist Sandra Wallman believes that there are six types of necessary resources for family life: structural resources; land (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Residential&lt;/span>;); labor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Services&lt;/span >;); Capital (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Money&lt;/span>;); Organizational resources (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Resources that put structural resources into actual use&lt;/span>;); time, information, self-identity (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sense of belonging, self-esteem&lt;/span span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is necessary for people to realize that they are eligible and have access to these resources, otherwise it will be difficult to use rescue services. People who are living in difficulty should not kill their children, but should actively seek help and find ways to get out of their predicaments. It is important to prepare social resources, but I think it is more important to solve the problem of society clearly providing resources, but people are unable to take the initiative to ask for help. We must let everyone realize that if there are difficulties, we must use social resources and society to make adequate preparations for everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In these families, the mother is often the one who receives the most attention. What state are they usually in? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the cases I participated in, every mother suffered from mental trauma and serious psychological problems. Mothers who are physically and mentally healthy can use a variety of resources to get over the hump. The formation of psychological problems is related to the mother&#39;s lack of care in childhood and repeated violence during childhood and marriage. The experience of sexual violence can be particularly deeply traumatic. The mothers in many cases appeared to have experienced sexual violence in a situation where their self-esteem was not protected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in these cases, the aiding party failed to fully play its role. Clients often lack relevant knowledge and do not know that they can receive help. In 2010, a case occurred in Nishi-ku, Osaka City. The mother of the child is a full-time housewife. Although she received full social assistance when raising children, she did not even receive child support allowance after the divorce, and she never thought of seeking any social assistance. This really surprised me. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Reporter&#39;s note: In 2010, a mother in Nishi-ku, Osaka, Japan abandoned her 1-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl for 50 consecutive days. Causing them to starve to death. The mother left home, leaving her two children at home, and never came back.&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the differences among mothers with different education levels and social classes regarding seeking help? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have not investigated how differences in education and class affect families. But even mothers with outstanding knowledge and high education may not be able to seek appropriate assistance if their self-esteem is taken away and they no longer believe in their own worth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are also people who overcome difficulties with the help of wisdom. When difficulty intensifies, knowledge is even more needed to overcome it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A survey shows that about half of single mothers have difficulties in living. Even if women are eager to work, they often can only enter the workplace by doing part-time jobs and cannot become regular employees, which means that they cannot receive normal income. Sometimes, the mother&#39;s income alone is not enough to support her children. This is a problem that needs to be addressed as a society, not just mothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In many specific cases, I found that men’s fear of leaving the social class in which they grew up seems to have gradually become the reason why they are violent towards family members and violent towards their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese society is currently experiencing an economic downturn and social functions are gradually shrinking, which adds to the worries of being a parent. Continuous interviews over the past 20 years have given me the impression that cases of child abuse deaths have also been affected by the retrenchment of social functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Z4NhPACsTexDnNlEpygQrFeZAvgbSuBzce4y7338.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;654&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Z4NhPACsTexDnNlEpygQrFeZAvgbSuBzce4y7338.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 23, 2023, in Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, a 6-year-old boy was tortured to death and his body was dumped.

Has the proportion of husbands’ participation in family childcare changed? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Haru Sugiyama:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At present, Japan’s economic development is in a period of stagnation. I think society’s requirements for women are no longer limited to protecting the family. Probably only those who marry men with very strong financial ability are allowed to &quot;maintain the household&quot; - there are also a few families where the husband does not allow the wife to work outside the home even though the family is very poor. However, patriarchal values ​​are still very strong, and everyone still believes that family values ​​are in the hands of men, and women only provide assistance. This view also binds many people unconsciously. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the past, the proportion of fathers participating in child care in Japanese society should have increased. Twenty or thirty years ago, very few fathers went to kindergarten to pick up and drop off their children, but the situation now has improved a lot compared to that time, and everyone has begun to think that it is normal for fathers to pick up and drop off their children. More companies allow employees to take parental leave, and men&#39;s participation in childcare is much more common than before. The maternity leave system for men in large companies has gradually improved, and the success rate of men applying for maternity leave has also become higher. This means that a conscious reform of society is underway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a &quot;separated generation parenting&quot; in Japan similar to China (by Grandparents raising children) phenomenon? Is there a problem of &quot;left-behind children&quot; in Japan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; &quot;Skip-generation parenting&quot; has also happened in the past, but in today&#39;s Japanese society, grandparents and maternal grandparents often lose their jobs due to insufficient pensions. If you can&#39;t make a living, you still have to work in society. The situation may be different in each region, but the number of families that the previous generation could comfortably help with childcare was probably limited. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About the issue of &quot;left-behind children&quot;. In today&#39;s Japanese society, the number of young people going to work in big cities from small areas has decreased compared with before. The phenomenon of migrant workers used to be very popular, but now things have changed. In addition, most young people with financial difficulties seem to choose not to get married or have children. The declining birthrate is a major problem that Japanese society needs to face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Separate-generation parenting&quot; and &quot;left-behind children&quot; phenomena are also reflected It explains some Chinese people&#39;s understanding of childcare - childcare is a &quot;public matter&quot; for a family or even a family. This is different from the cultural understanding of childcare in Japan and South Korea. How do you understand this difference? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It turns out that in China, childcare is a &quot;public matter&quot; of the family. This is very interesting. It turns out that parenting has a public nature, which moved me very much. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, the nature of childcare is private. It gives me the impression that childcare is basically centered on the small family. In other words, the small family is not actually &quot;private&quot; but A minimalist “public” with responsibility. The restricted &quot;family&quot; is burdened with everything. The parent-child relationship is very close, and some children are controlled by their mothers. The problem of underage caregivers in Japan also needs to be solved urgently. In some families, parents lack basic abilities or have behavioral disorders or mental illnesses, and they have to be cared for by their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Whether it emphasizes the rescue of abused children or the treatment of abuse There is a lag in judicial punishment of behavior, and the damage has already been done. Is the socialization of childcare responsibilities important? What is Japan’s current progress in this regard? What support should be provided but is not? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You are right. The family system in modern society has become increasingly difficult to maintain with the development of economy and capitalist society. In the past, people relied on their family&#39;s industries to make a living, but in today&#39;s society, people have to spend money to buy labor, and the intergenerational nature of the family is no longer available. Although the era of having children for the family still has a certain influence on the present, the concept and form of family have changed. If society is not aware of this problem, people raising children may be in pain forever. In my opinion, Japan currently lacks awareness of socialized parenting. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/1BOnhzrjk82P9hZmXn1pzMruYmoidjR9Xi1UPhsB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 956&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/1BOnhzrjk82P9hZmXn1pzMruYmoidjR9Xi1UPhsB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255444&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda.

What is the birth environment like in Japan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the reason why children are killed by their parents is because women cannot choose whether to have children or not in the current society. Society should make changes so that women can take charge of their own lives. In addition, the power of society is also very important, and it has the responsibility to carefully care for and nurture every life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s contraceptive pills, especially emergency contraceptive pills, also require a doctor’s diagnosis before they can be prescribed. They are also expensive and not readily available to women. The current situation is that the pregnant woman herself cannot decide whether to give birth to the baby. Society lacks awareness of raising children together, and individual women cannot make the decision for themselves when it comes to having children. This interview made me realize that Japanese women have to bear the burden of childcare, but there is a lack of social assistance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;South Korea will become the country with the lowest fertility rate in the world in 2022.

People with financial means get married, have children, and raise their children like people in the past. People who lack financial resources will have to work hard to raise children and find it difficult to feel happy.

Society should at least not let any child go hungry. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the number of nurseries in Japan increased, the number of children who met the requirements but were unable to enter kindergartens decreased rapidly. This is achieved at the expense of lowering standards of care for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has also adjusted its education system so that children can receive free education. Children from poor families also receive free scholarships to further their studies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the school&#39;s facilities are still imperfect. Or some old facilities could be easily updated before, but now they have not been able to do so. The actual budget spent on children is pitifully small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The government has already invested money in institutions such as children&#39;s canteens. Although these institutions are of varying quality, they have all received government funds. However, the state cannot guarantee the quality of children&#39;s canteens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we want children to grow up truly happy, we should start from the country, pay attention to the growth of each child, and strive to improve the parenting environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;How can I have a child if I am not living well?&quot; ——Deteriorating economic conditions, increasing education costs, etc. are problems that many young people have to face when considering having children.

&lt;p>;2023年10月20日晚间，微博网友爆料称，苏州虎丘山风景区有大量流浪猫死于投毒，并附上猫尸体照片。这一信息在抖音、小红书等多个平台发酵，为流浪动物管理争议添上新的一笔。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月22日，虎丘山风景区管理处的工作人员刘芳向南方周末记者证实，10月10日至16日之间，园区内发现14只猫咪死亡。但查看监控后，没有发现猫咪死于投毒的证据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月16日，四川崇州罗威纳犬咬伤女童。有网友将虎丘流浪猫的死亡事件与狗咬女童关联，但南方周末记者采访发现，虎丘流浪猫的死亡大多发生在狗咬女童之前，意味着这更可能是一起孤立事件。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得关注的是，近期社交网络上虐杀流浪动物话题数量骤增。中南财经政法大学法学院教授钱叶芳也注意到了社交媒体上的“仇狗仇猫”情绪，在她看来，其背后既有狗肉产业链从业者的煽动，也是“踢猫效应”的表现：“不敢向强者表达负面情绪，就向弱者发泄。层层向下传递，最后传给了不会说话的动物。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;常年呼吁出台《伴侣动物保护和管理法》之余，钱叶芳在杭州市钱塘区海天社区开展了一场延续三年多的试验。对于流浪动物管理，她给出的解法并不新颖但任重道远：完善立法、倡导文明养犬、杜绝当街扑杀、合理处置以及多与民间力量合作等。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;景区已经报警&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;虎丘山风景区位于苏州西部，主体是一座海拔34.3米的小山，南北两处山脚下各设一出入口。在景区内盆景园工作的季杰告诉南方周末记者，南北入口以及盆景园的游客密度较小，又地势平坦，因此成为流浪猫们的主要据点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在季杰和同事们的投喂下，盆景区已生活着十几只猫。而景区管理处也发现了猫咪身上的流量潜质。虎丘山景区抖音官方账号2020年4月发布的一条短视频中，出现了一只叫“tiger” 的橘猫，名字寓意虎丘的“虎”。这条视频获得了482个点赞，是同期发布的花草风光视频点赞量的十倍以上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这场突如其来的死亡事件令不少员工感到难过。季杰回忆，一位参加过“小动物保护协会”的同事发现，一只从小喂大的猫咪抽搐、吐白沫，他试图灌水抢救。但小猫终究没救过来，还在挣扎之中咬了他一口。除了这只死在同事面前的之外，季杰估计盆景区还少了两三只猫。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虎丘景区内，大多数职工白天都要值守岗位，而猫咪往往在傍晚游人稀少时候才出来活动。有的猫咪在入夜后死去，尸体在清晨被清洁工收走。多数人没有亲眼见到尸体，只是直观感到猫咪数量变少，随后才从网络上听闻“毒死”一事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;感到小猫变少的还有景区南门附近摆摊的梅阿姨。以往每天清晨上班，梅阿姨的手推车碾过路面的声音都会吸引五六只猫咪讨食。十一长假过完不久，这批小猫的数量减少到两三只。此后，她每天询问清洁工是否捡到小猫尸体，得到连续肯定的答复后，她非常悲愤。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘芳表示，猫咪死亡地点主要集中在南门、西溪环翠（西园）、万景山庄（即盆景园）。从地图上看，这三片地带相毗邻，集中于景区南侧。季杰和盆景区的其他员工都提到，猫咪死亡事件的前几日，曾有游客投诉称在盆景区内被猫抓伤。这二者之间会不会有关联？除了蓄意报复，季杰实在想不到有什么理由能解释这一切。当然，他没有任何证据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘芳表示，景区已经报警，派出所已介入此案。园方也调取了监控，检查了地面，但未发现毒物。“如果之后再发现猫咪死亡，我们会拜托公安部门第一时间物检，以确定这是否一起人为事件。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事件发生后，景区进一步加强了现场安保巡查人员力量，及时清理散落地面的食物残渣，并劝阻游客随意投喂小动物。10月26日，刘芳表示，景区组织了猫咪关爱志愿服务队，在景区猫咪出入较多的点位安装智能猫箱，专人管理、远程监测、定点投喂，为猫咪创造安全的生活环境。同时，在景区播放动物保护倡议视频，制作关爱猫咪提示牌。“后期我们将持续关注景区内猫的生存状况，尽可能为它们提供必要的帮助和保障。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;流言核实，有真有假&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;狗咬女童事件后，伤狗、伤猫的舆论持续发酵。南方周末记者对其中部分爆料进行了核实。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位杭州博主爆料称，10月18日，自己养的雪纳瑞和柴犬被房东的父亲偷走杀死，其中柴犬被扒皮剁碎，“怀疑他就是要吃狗肉”。三天之后，当事人删除原发表于小红书的事件经过相关笔记，并注销账号。当事人婉拒了南方周末记者的采访邀请，表示事情已经结束，不想被打扰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位接近该博主的人士披露，事件双方已由公安局调解，对方已经公开道歉并赔偿损失，当事人会将赔偿金捐赠给流浪猫狗公益项目。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一起爆料的真实性则存在争议。10月20日，一位微博用户爆料称，武汉凤凰花园小区物业于10月19日晚打死“三只4个月大的小狗和一只怀孕的猫妈妈”，附上了“凶手”保安、几只猫狗尸体照片。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月25日晚间，凤凰花园小区物业一位工作人员对南方记者表示，打狗一事属于讹传。真实情况是有多名小区业主投诉流浪猫狗吠叫扰民，于是物业组织保安对流浪动物进行驱离，而非扑杀。物业已于10月20日上午拨打110报警，向江夏区藏龙岛派出所民警备案，重申没有捕杀流浪动物。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;被“曝光”后，小区物业短时间内接到大量电话，有的“接起来就骂，说我们不是人”，影响了物业工作正常开展。南方周末记者拨打了其中一些号码，多数人表示，自己是在小红书、微信群而非微博上看到的爆料信息。目前小红书已找不到相关资讯，可能已被爆料者删帖。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有微博博主利用识图软件辨识发现，有多起网传捕杀流浪狗的新闻实属“旧闻”或移花接木。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有的伤害流浪动物新闻已得到证实。10月21日，四川科技职业学院通报学生宿舍内宰杀流浪狗事件：给予两名学生留校察看处分，已报警移交公安机关处理；搜狐千里眼报道，江苏镇江一居民在小区遛狗时发现草坪被投放大量疑似塞了药粒的“毒火腿”，小区内已有流浪猫误食死亡。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;警惕“踢猫效应”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;钱叶芳认为，在庞杂的流浪动物死亡新闻中，除了区分真伪外，还有必要对行为性质进行界定：政府主管部门组织的捕获、收容以及后续的无害化处置，与个人对流浪动物的“私刑”处决乃至手段残忍的虐杀行为不可同日而语。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱叶芳从2018年开始关注流浪动物问题。在她观察中，每当出现狗咬人的事件，网络上也会随之掀起一股支持扑杀流浪动物的声浪。除了各方观点本身存在分歧外，钱叶芳认为，舆论场中还存在一些猫狗肉或虐待动物产业链的从业者在搅混水、带节奏，使得鼓励极端的声音不时占据上风。这其实是强者欺凌弱者——“踢猫效应”在社会情绪中的表现。比如一个人在单位里被老板批评了，回到家就把郁闷的情绪发泄到妻子身上，妻子再发泄到孩子身上。孩子的怒火无处发泄，出门看到一只猫，就上去踢了一脚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/9c19b8a38a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/9c19b8a38a.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;但是流浪猫繁殖能力强，可能对鸟类等小型野生动物形成威胁。抓捕-绝育-放归（TNR，Trap Neuter Release）模式是目前推广的实践，在钱叶芳的TNR实践中，她还摸索出了一条低成本开展流浪猫绝育的路径：和附近的宠物医院合作，在社区宠物家长群里给医院做爱心宣传，作为回报，医院每月能够免费进行两例绝育手术，超过两例的则按照母猫100元、公猫50元来收费，非常低廉。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当地时间2023年10月23日，拉法口岸，两名被哈马斯关押的以色列老年人质被移交给以色列国防军。被释放前，她们已经在加沙地带被扣押了17天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这是哈马斯释放的第二批人质。 10月20日，同样是在加沙边境地带，哈马斯释放了一对来自美国的母女朱迪思·拉南和娜塔莉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“人质问题让内塔尼亚胡左右为难，以色列想要彻底消灭哈马斯，并在加沙建立新秩序，而哈马斯则将劫持的人质作为谈判筹码，试图干扰以色列的地面进攻计划。”在复旦大学中东研究中心研究员邹志强看来，双方仍在持续的博弈之中，妥协难度极大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;值得一提的是，连续两批人质释放，卡塔尔都从中斡旋。在两名美国人质获救后，美国总统拜登公开对卡塔尔表示谢意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10月25日，卡塔尔首相兼外交大臣穆罕默德再度就人质谈判进展进行回应。他表示，谈判仍在积极进行中，双方已有一些进展和突破。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在风云突变的巴以冲突中，海湾小国卡塔尔游走于烽火之间，就人质问题展开斡旋。人们不禁好奇：为何是卡塔尔这个“弹丸小国”？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;”释放的人质具有针对性“&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;深沉的夜色中，在哈马斯士兵陪同下，两名女性人质被移交给身穿红十字国际委员会制服的工作人员。两名哈马斯士兵脸蒙黑色面纱，手持钢枪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在离开之前，其中一名人质转身与哈马斯枪手握手告别，并说道“Shalom”。在希伯来语中，“Shalom”意指“和平”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年10月23日晚间，哈马斯分享了一段人质释放的视频。视频中被释放的两名人质分别是79岁的努里特·库珀和85岁的约奇里·利夫希茨，她们居住在以色列尼尔奥兹基布兹，那里紧邻加沙边境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10月7日，哈马斯发起“阿克萨洪水”行动，1200名哈马斯武装枪手越过边境，对以色列南部发动袭击，并卷走了大批人质。库珀和利夫希茨也在被绑架的人质之列，一同被绑的还有她们的丈夫，目前仍被扣留在加沙。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;以色列军方称，被哈马斯扣押在加沙地带的人质为222人，“绝大部分还活着”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“事实上，通过突袭以色列，哈马斯的主要军事目标已经实现。绑架人质主要是为了让以色列有所顾忌，方便以后讨价还价。”邹志强分析。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;根据利夫希茨的讲述，被绑架后，她被带进加沙地下一个巨大的隧道网络，那里“看起来像蜘蛛网”。她们和哈马斯守卫吃同样的食物——皮塔饼、奶酪和黄瓜。为了确保人质健康，每隔两三天就会有一名医生来查看他们的身体情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当被问及为何与枪手握手时，利夫希茨表示，劫持者对她很好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;按照哈马斯的说法，人质释放是出于“人道主义原因”。但在受访专家看来，哈马斯释放人质，兼具施压和展现妥协姿态的双重目的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“在以色列持续空袭和大兵压境的双重压力下，哈马斯正在寻找时机，以释放人质为要挟，换取以色列军事上的让步。”邹志强指出，“截至目前，所释放的人质均为非战斗人员和女性。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;值得注意的是，哈马斯释放的第一批人质为美以双重国籍，她们来自芝加哥。被俘时，两人正在以色列探亲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“哈马斯选择释放的人质具有针对性。”中国社会科学院西亚非洲研究所研究员余国庆告诉南方周末记者，“哈马斯寄希望于美国尽可能向以色列施压，使其在地面军事行动中保留一定余地。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10月18日，拜登踏上访以之旅，除了表示对以色列的坚定支持之外，拜登还和以色列总理内塔尼亚胡讨论了人质问题。拜登强调，确保美国人质安全回国是其首要任务。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但时至今日，仍有包括11名美国人在内的几十名外籍人士被扣留在加沙。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“目前，人质是哈马斯与以色列对抗中最有价值的筹码，在双方实力不对称的情况下，哈马斯将充分利用这张牌打开局面。”余国庆分析，“什么时候释放人质，一次释放多少，哈马斯并不会听命于卡塔尔。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;合适的&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;调解&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;者&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;哈马斯突袭以色列以来，加沙地区遭遇火箭弹无情炮轰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10月25日晚间至26日凌晨，以色列国防军对加沙地带发起一次大规模地面进攻，24小时内进行了约250次空袭。内塔尼亚胡在电视讲话中称，“我们正向哈马斯倾泻地狱之火……而这仅仅是刚开始。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;而距加沙千里之外的卡塔尔，则在巴以冲突之后变得热闹起来，各国政要纷至沓来。急匆匆出访卡塔尔的既有美国国务卿布林肯，还有法国总统马克龙的黎巴嫩问题特使。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;各国政要齐聚卡塔尔，人质问题成为一个绕不开的话题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;加沙是哈马斯的大本营，哈马斯将人质分批隐藏在庞大的地下隧道内。 “我们没有加沙每栋房屋和街道的具体数据。”在以色列军事情报系统工作了20年的迈克尔·米尔斯坦警告说，“这是以色列历史上遇到的最困难的人质局势。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;解救人质难上加难，斡旋成为人质获取自由的重要途径。在此背景下，卡塔尔国际调解者的独特角色愈加凸显。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;总部设在日内瓦的阿拉伯和地中海世界研究中心主任哈斯尼·阿比迪指出，“斡旋者并不多，而卡塔尔是最合适的调解者。这个小国没有自己的地区议程，也不关心调解的政治用途。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“卡塔尔财大气粗，而且交际广泛，长袖善舞，与美国和哈马斯均保持密切往来，这为其斡旋人质危机，提供了独特的优势。”余国庆表示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;卡塔尔是美国18个“重要非北约盟友”中的一员。位于卡塔尔首都多哈西南35公里的乌代德空军基地，是美国驻海外最大军事基地之一，也是美国中央司令部的前沿指挥中心，部署着大约1万名美军和100架军机。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2021年，美国从阿富汗仓皇撤军，乌代德空军基地就承担着“中转枢纽”的角色。据统计，美国从阿富汗撤出12.3万人，其中约5.7万经卡塔尔中转。事实上，美国和塔利班的撤军协议，本就是在多哈达成的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“在背靠美国之余，卡塔尔还与哈马斯、真主党等西方国家眼中的&#39;激进组织&#39;密切往来。”余国庆说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;卡塔尔是哈马斯重要的经济支持者，为加沙提供了大量的援助、投资、人道主义和基础设施建设。法国国际关系与战略研究所副所长迪迪埃·比利翁指出，卡塔尔每月向哈马斯提供3000万美元的财政支持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;卡塔尔不仅与哈马斯在经济上保持密切往来，而且在政治上提供庇护。 2012年，卡塔尔埃米尔哈马德·本·哈立法·阿勒萨尼访问加沙。这是哈马斯2007年夺取加沙控制权之后，第一位到访该地区的国家元首。也是从2012年起，哈马斯领导人开始长驻多哈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在美国及其敌对势力之间两边周旋，卡塔尔的角色看似矛盾，实际上离不开美国的“包容”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“美国的中东战略具有内在缺陷，一方面，美国希望依托盟友体系实现中东意图，但另一方面，其拉一派打一派的做法又制造了形形色色的敌人，尤其是各种次国际组织和非国家武装团体。”邹志强分析，“当美国无法用武力压制来达到外交目的时，就必须找一个中间人从中斡旋，卡塔尔扮演的正是这样的关键角色。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;卡塔尔的雄心&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;卡塔尔三面环海，南部陆地与沙特阿拉伯接壤，似一叶扁舟停靠在波斯湾西海岸。与国土形状相似，在国际外交中，卡塔尔亦如同一艘“快速而灵活的小船”，在不同势力之间周旋平衡，扮演着传话人和调解者的角色。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;积极斡旋巴以人质危机，只是卡塔尔扮演国际斡旋“热心人”角色的一个缩影。短短一个多月时间，卡塔尔已连续三次周旋，积极充当人质解救、换囚等活动中间人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年10月16日，卡塔尔政府宣布，在持续数月的调解之下，俄罗斯同意释放四名乌克兰儿童，他们将通过卡塔尔驻莫斯科大使馆，采取不同路线返回乌克兰。卡塔尔官方在声明中称，四名儿童遣返“只是第一步”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月18日，美伊正式交换五名分别被关押在美国和伊朗的囚犯，而换囚的地点恰恰是在多哈。实际上，这场谈判能够成功，离不开卡塔尔的斡旋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据公开报道，美伊之间的谈判是在多哈进行的。谈判中，双方代表互不见面，分别待在不同的酒店，而中间人卡塔尔则两边奔跑，扮演传声筒的角色。经过至少八轮隔空谈话，美国和伊朗最终达成换囚协议。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;卡塔尔国土面积仅有约1.15万平方公里，总人口为300万。这样一个小国，为何能够频繁活跃在国际舞台上，在重大冲突事件中发挥远超自身体量的作用？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“20世纪90年代，卡塔尔就将&#39;外交立国&#39;战略写入宪法，此后一直采取多面下注的策略，在各个势力之间周旋平衡。与此同时，卡塔尔具有极其丰富的石油和天然气资源，雄厚的财力为卡塔尔的外交战略提供了有力支撑。”余国庆分析。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;受访专家学者均告诉南方周末记者，卡塔尔“小国大外交”战略既是出于自身生存的需要，更暗藏着巨大的外交雄心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;中东地区矛盾交织，冲突多发。 “夹杂在地区大国之间，卡塔尔不愿意被动受制于人，在不同势力之间选边站队。出于安全考量，卡塔尔寄希望于通过外交斡旋的高调方式，换取相关国家提供保护，以确保自身国家安全和政治安全。”邹志强表示，“事实上，卡塔尔之所以不怕引火烧身，很大程度上是因为背靠美国这棵大树。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“更为关键的是，以&#39;大外交&#39;的姿态在地缘危机事件中奔走斡旋，可以进一步凸显卡塔尔的地区重要性和国际影响力。”邹志强进一步说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;然而，卡塔尔并不是完全唯美国马首是瞻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;巴以冲突以来，美国力挺以色列，但卡塔尔并没有完全跟随美国的脚步。相反，卡塔尔外交部谴责称，以色列对局势持续升级负有全部责任，国际社会迫切需要阻止以色列违反国际法的行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“卡塔尔有自己的考量，不会完全跟着美国的利益走。”邹志强指出，“采取多面下注战略在不同势力之间周旋平衡，而不是一边倒地投靠大国或跟随盟友，是卡塔尔扮演中间人角色的重要基础。只有长袖善舞，卡塔尔才能有更大的斡旋空间。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但这样的平衡外交并非没有风险。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2017年6月，以沙特为首的多个中东北非国家指控卡塔尔政府“支持极端势力、介入他国内政、制造区域不稳定局势”，突然宣布同卡塔尔断交，并对卡塔尔实施了关闭边境和空域等禁运和封锁措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;断交危机持续了将近四年才结束。直到2021年1月，沙特等国才宣布与卡塔尔达成和解，正式恢复全面外交关系。 &lt;/p>;
