On June 25, 2003, Li Jinhua, the then Auditor General of the National Audit Office, delivered the 2002 annual audit work report to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. A number of ministries and commissions, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, and the former State Planning Commission, were publicly criticized. At that time, the Internet had just emerged, and the full text of the report was made public on the official website of the National Audit Office, attracting national attention and calling it an &quot;audit storm.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong, a professor at the School of Government Auditing at Nanjing Audit University, believes that 20 years ago, the public was accustomed to the government keeping fiscal revenue and expenditures secret. At that time, &quot;disclosure itself was a hot topic,&quot; but now, even if public opinion does not pay attention , auditing also functions as usual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back over the past 20 years, it is not difficult to find that with the development of society, the focus of auditing has also changed. Different periods have different priorities, and some content has become history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Tell the truth&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 2022 audit work report has many highlights. Different from previous scientific and technological achievements transformation audits, this time for the first time it focused on basic research and key core technology tasks, pointing out that some task deployments and requirements deviated from the planned goals, and some scientific research results were suspected of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audit found that for 45 key tasks, from the formulation of implementation plans to the signing of task contracts, the indicator requirements were reduced step by step. Some technologies have been mass-produced in China and do not need to be tackled. The pass rate of 649 accepted projects was 96.5%, but a spot check of 135 of them found that 34 had actually not completed all tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong observed, &quot;Every year we review and find problems every year.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2022 annual audit work report pointed out that 41 regions collected state-owned capital gains from loss-making enterprises, levied excessive taxes, or directly and randomly apportioned fines, etc., and illegally organized fiscal revenue of 7.75 billion yuan; 49 regions passed the commitment Through methods such as bottom-up buybacks and state-owned enterprise advance financing for construction, illegal new hidden debts of 41.516 billion yuan were added; 12 regions had to allocate treasury funds from superiors&#39; over-budget quotas, obtain bank advances or external borrowings of 28.072 billion yuan to maintain basic operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem of neglect of management and supervision by units affiliated to various central ministries and commissions still exists. For example, 3 departments and 29 affiliated units were extravagant and wasteful. Some spent more than 27 million yuan to rent office space, with the per capita office area reaching 137 square meters. Some exceeded the contract schedule and spent 84.5807 million yuan at the end of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar problems were named 20 years ago. The 2002 annual audit work report pointed out that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology fabricated false project budgets, signed false construction contracts with an engineering agency, and allocated 1.35 million yuan in budget funds. The Agency then recovered it in batches and used it mainly for the payment of staff subsidies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An audit cadre recalled that it was in 2003 that the Audit Office became known to the public. Twenty years have passed since the Audit Office was established in 1983. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 25, 2003, after the full text of the 2002 audit work report was made public on the official website of the National Audit Office, it was widely reproduced by the media. Yang Suchang, a professor at the School of Economics at Lanzhou University, still remembers the shock brought by the report, &quot;(It turns out) the problem is so serious.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problems disclosed this year include: the fiscal revenue of counties and cities is relatively &quot;watered&quot;, artificial concealment of deficits is common, and the debt burden is heavy; the problem of enterprises failing to pay basic pension insurance funds is relatively common, and relevant management departments have misappropriated 420 million yuan; the National College English Level 4 and Level 6 Examination Committee of the Ministry of Education illegally collected 224 million yuan of examination fees from various places, from which 190 million yuan was spent on related examination fees and other expenses. etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the shocking nature of the problems announced, the public called it an &quot;audit storm.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;audit storm&quot; may be traced back to 1999. According to the audit work procedures at that time, every May, the National Audit Office should issue an audit results report to the State Council on the audit work of the previous year. Based on this report, it would then draft an audit work report to be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress fully explained the problems discovered in the audit. On June 26, 1999, Li Jinhua made the &quot;1998 Audit Work Report&quot; to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, pointing out that 43 departments and directly affiliated units of the State Council had misappropriated 3.124 billion yuan of fiscal funds and other issues. The China Economic Times quoted some members as saying , saying it was “the best audit report in many years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;After the 18th National Congress, poverty alleviation auditing became a focus&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since 2003, what areas have audit work focused on? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters combed through and found that among the 21 &quot;Audit Work Reports&quot; from 2002 to 2022, in addition to the fixed annual financial audits, resource and environmental protection, social security funds, agriculture and rural areas are the most concerned. fields, appeared 17 times, 13 times, and 13 times respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In different periods, audit work also has different priorities. Taking the &quot;three official&quot; funds as an example, the 2007 annual audit work report used 103 words, pointing out for the first time that the tax department purchased cars without and beyond the establishment, as well as the problems of insufficient strict control of entertainment expenses, conference fees, training fees and overseas expenses. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, with the formulation and implementation of the eight central regulations, the &quot;three public&quot; funds began to become the focus of audit supervision. The 2013 annual audit work report used an unprecedented 1,244 words to directly address the management and use of &quot;three official&quot; funds and conference fees, naming 22 central departments and affiliated units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, the “three official” funds and conference fee expenditures of central departments dropped by 27% compared with the previous year, and the reform of official vehicles at the department level was basically completed. However, the audit still found that 33 departments and units, including the Ministry of Science and Technology and the former Ministry of Culture, occupied vehicles from other units for a long time, or leased 122 official vehicles in disguise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For nine consecutive years, &quot;three public funds&quot; have been mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poverty alleviation was once the focus of the report. After the &quot;targeted poverty alleviation&quot; strategy was proposed in November 2013, the following year, the audit report once again included content on poverty alleviation auditing after a lapse of ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report pointed out that after auditing 19 key counties for national poverty alleviation and development work, it was found that 15.9571 million yuan of poverty alleviation funds were misappropriated by individuals, 173 million yuan of poverty alleviation funds were falsely claimed or misappropriated, and 5 counties had poverty alleviation funds. The department in charge of work illegally included 533,600 yuan in food, drink, and travel expenses among poverty alleviation management fees and other funds, and 227 million yuan in poverty alleviation funds remained idle for more than one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/evLOaYcG1oPhzGE1tX8YmI86cZI29BnAy3yyGxM4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1271&quot; height= &quot;739&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/evLOaYcG1oPhzGE1tX8YmI86cZI29BnAy3yyGxM4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251919&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The 2022 annual audit work report pointed out that it is difficult for local governments to coordinate, integrate and use high-standard farmland construction funds. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 29, 2015, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Decision on Winning the Battle against Poverty&quot; , proposed to ensure that the rural poor will be lifted out of poverty by 2020, requiring the key links of accurate identification and establishment of files to be lifted out of poverty through industrial support and other measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was reflected in the report of the second year. The &quot;2015 Audit Work Report&quot; mentioned that a random inspection of 1,339 poverty alleviation household discount loans of 65.6 million yuan issued in Xundian County, Yunnan Province in 2015 Among them, only 711 amounts of 34.33 million yuan (accounting for 52%) were distributed to registered poor households. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2022, the report has audited employment subsidies and employment promotion funds for two consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Some sectors have been renamed 7 times&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the past 20 years, the form of audit work reports has also changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One change is the report name. The 2012 annual audit report produced in 2013 was titled &quot;Audit Work Report on the Implementation of the Central Budget and Other Financial Revenues and Expenditures in 2012&quot;. The following year, it was changed to &quot;Audit Work Report of the State Council on the Implementation of the Central Budget and Other Financial Revenues and Expenditures in 2013&quot;. , this format has been fixed to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not simply 3 more words. Zheng Xiaorong believes that according to the provisions of the Audit Law, the audit work report is submitted by the State Council to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. In practice, the National Audit Office makes the report on behalf of the State Council. Adding &quot;State Council&quot; to the title is more in line with the spirit of the Audit Law and can better reflect the authority of the audit work report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the title at the beginning of the audit work report was adjusted from the previous &quot;Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress&quot; to &quot;Chairman, Vice Chairmen, Secretary-General, and Members.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zheng Xiaorong&#39;s view, the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress is an institution, and the latter is more specific, &quot;similar to a roll call.&quot; The change of title is &quot;I hope that when deliberation and resolution of work reports, everyone attending the meeting &quot;People&#39;s Congress attaches great importance to it and strengthens the supervision role of the National People&#39;s Congress.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public is particularly concerned about which units are named. Over the past 20 years, the &quot;roll call&quot; has gone through a process from vague to gradually clear, and the number of named units has also changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2002 annual audit work report blurred some region and unit information, replacing it with &quot;a certain province&quot;, &quot;a certain district government&quot;, &quot;some airlines&quot;, etc. As for the persons who violated laws and disciplines discovered by the audit, it was not until the 2006 annual audit work report that the names of the parties began to appear. Previously, only their units and positions were named. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong believes that this is a sign of caution by the audit agency. Information disclosure was still sensitive at the time. &quot;After the information is disclosed, there will be unexpected results.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another change is that after 2017, the number of units named in the report decreased. Southern Weekend reporters did not make complete statistics. In 2017, the report named 24 units, but this number dropped to 3 in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Li Yuedong, director of the Audit Department of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, this has something to do with the changes in the audit function. &quot;Now it is more about helping the audited unit solve problems.&quot; The time for audit evidence collection is limited, and More emphasis is placed on the discovery of major problems. &quot;Some small problems may not necessarily appear in the report. Just inform them of the rectification.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong added that in the past, some audited units were not very cooperative during the work process and did not report in the report. Name-calling was once a way to promote rectification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fixed sections in the audit work report have also undergone many name changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that for the first time in the 2008 annual audit work report, the chapter &quot;Disclosure and investigation of major violations of laws and regulations&quot; appeared. In addition to announcing the number of transferred clues to major violations of laws and regulations and economic crime cases, In addition to the number of people involved, the form, means and methods of the crime are also summarized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the chapter has been renamed 7 times, such as &quot;Major violations of laws and regulations and economic crime cases discovered by audit&quot; in 2012, and &quot;Major violations of laws and regulations discovered by audit&quot; in 2013. In 2014, it was “cases suspected of major violations of laws and regulations detected by audit.” In 2021, it was renamed &quot;Clues to Major Violations of Discipline and Law&quot; and remains so far. The issues mentioned include &quot;corruption of petty officials&quot;, micro-corruption at the grassroots level and &quot;supporters taking advantage of the mountain&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 21 audit reports, the content, location and name of the chapters are not fixed as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Xiaorong also noticed this phenomenon. He believed that as the system gradually becomes standardized, the audit agency has discretion over the form of the audit work report, which will also affect the text form and framework of the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Breaking Barriers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Governments at different levels bear public entrusted economic responsibilities. While fulfilling their responsibilities, the government has also been given specific responsibilities. Power.&quot; Cai Chun believes that the role of auditing is to ensure the fulfillment of government responsibilities and promote the use of public power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that the 2009 annual audit work report pointed out the overall large scale of local government debt, the high debt repayment pressure of some local governments, and the insufficient solvency of fiscal funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, in accordance with the requirements of the State Council, in 2011 the National Audit Office organized more than 40,000 audit agencies across the country to conduct audits on all audit offices across the country based on the principle of &quot;seeing accounts, people, and objects, and reviewing each transaction one by one.&quot; 25,590 government departments and agencies, 6,576 financing platform companies, 54,061 other units, 373,805 projects and 1,873,683 debts involved in local government debt were audited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Audit rectification was once a &quot;difficult&quot; issue. Before the revision of the Audit Law in 2021, there were no specific provisions on what measures should be taken if the audit object does not make rectifications as required. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until the newly revised Audit Law responded: &quot;The audit results and rectification status should be used as an important reference for assessing, appointing and removing, rewarding and punishing leading cadres, formulating policies, and improving systems; those who refuse to rectify or commit fraud during rectification will be Legal responsibilities shall be pursued in accordance with the law.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Audit Law, audit agencies are under the dual leadership of the government at the same level and the audit agency at the next higher level. In reality, the government at the same level has a greater influence on the audit agency at the same level. Liu Air Force, a staff member of the Audit Bureau of Huaihua City, Hunan Province, published an article in 2009 stating that 62% of team members in 13 local county (city, district) grassroots audit agencies were adjusted without consulting the superior audit agency in advance, resulting in dual management. Just a formality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Zheng Xiaorong, before the audit results are reported to the people&#39;s congress at the same level, the government has the opportunity to intercept and screen the problems reported. &quot;Some problems cannot be investigated thoroughly, and the supervisory power cannot be extended downwards.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 2010, there were many views on the issue of audit system reform. According to an article published on the official website of the Audit Office in 2013, Huang Kai, the director of the Audit Office, summarized the views of all parties into the theory of upgrading. , vertical theory, independence theory and legislative theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The legislative theory that is most highly praised by industry insiders is that the audit agency is subordinate to the People&#39;s Congress and independently exercises audit supervision power over government departments. As early as 2002, Yang Suchang conducted a questionnaire survey among 62 Audit Office officials, local audit agency officials, government officials, People&#39;s Congress cadres, and audit scholars. 77% of the respondents agreed or basically agreed with the legislative audit system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The discussion on the reform of the audit system has not stopped. In December 2017, after the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Yang Suchang was invited by the National Audit Office to discuss the direction of audit system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer will be revealed soon. In March 2018, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the &quot;Plan for Deepening the Reform of Party and State Institutions&quot; and announced the establishment of the Central Audit Commission. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect it to be established.&quot; Yang Suchang said that from a practical perspective, &quot;Under the leadership of the Central Audit Commission, the audit work is integrated with the party&#39;s leadership and supervision system.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problems found in the audit &quot;must Reporting to the Central Audit Committee, and directly”.

More than 30% of the CEOs of large Silicon Valley companies in the United States are Indians. Among U.S. companies, the top ten Indian-Americans serve as chairman, CEO, president, and chief operating officer: Google &amp;amp; Alphabet, Microsoft, FedEx, IBM, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, NetApp, Barclays Group, Starbucks, and Adobe , Micron Technology and other world-renowned companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Led by this type of Indian professional managers who hold top-level positions, these companies have recruited a large number of younger, lower-level Indian elites for high- and middle-level management positions, technical positions, Key positions such as finance and human resources are increasingly occupied by Indian career elites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indians have an increasing influence in the Western world and have become the most powerful minority group in American and British societies. Many Westerners know that Indians are not easy to mess with, and the social status they have gained , the social achievements achieved far exceed those of local Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have interviewed some HR organizations to understand why they are willing to promote Indian professional managers, what employers think of Indian managers, and why Indians have achieved such achievements. The feedback received shows that Indians The advantages of ethnic-American workplace elites are roughly as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Value recognition: India was a British colony for a long time, and Indians were once ridiculed as British &quot;long-term laborers and coolies.&quot; However, Indians identify with and want to integrate into Britain and the United States. Social and lifestyle motivations are strong. Their purpose of studying hard is often to enter the British and American society, and gradually become &quot;foremen, housekeepers, and shopkeepers&quot; from &quot;long-term workers&quot;. When Indians go to Britain and the United States, they have no intention of going back. Instead, they try their best to take root there and transform from &quot;Indians&quot; to &quot;Indians.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Communication advantages: As a former British colony, high-end schools in India focus on English education. Therefore, its educational elites, despite their thick accents, have no barriers to language communication, which is a great advantage in the British and American workplaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Hindi belongs to the &quot;Eurasian language family&quot; and has many similarities with Western languages, based on Hinglish, there are also fewer obstacles for Indians to learn French, German, and Spanish. few. Therefore, the current trend of Indian workplace elites spreading from English-speaking societies to the entire Western world. The second communication advantage of Indians is that their living customs advocate chatting, chatting, and debating. Therefore, they can get along well with Westerners. Even if they have different opinions, they can chat and dare to talk. It is easier for them to get familiar with each other, which is good for promotion. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural diversity: India has 6 major religions, 22 official regional languages, 212 ethnic groups, and 414 tribes. Religions, cultures, and living customs vary greatly among regions and ethnic groups. Such a complex society makes Indians more adaptable to culturally diverse lifestyles. There has never been a &quot;grand unification&quot; in India&#39;s history, and its unification was all established with the help of the British. Therefore, when Indians come to the Western world, not only do they not find it weird and weird, but they think Westerners are too serious, rigid, and simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teamwork: Indians focus on teamwork and interpersonal relationships, and their individuals usually have good interpersonal and communication skills, which are very important for senior management positions. Indians are very cooperative, and Indian executives in companies try their best to recruit Indian employees. There have even been cases of fraud: when an American hospital recruits doctors, the Indian director throws away all the resumes of non-Indian applicants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The folk rule of the Indian people is: those who are successfully recruited should give all of their 1-3 months&#39; salary (the higher the position, the higher the kickback) to the recruiter to express their gratitude for the kindness. . Almost no one in the Indian community violates this convention, forming a long-standing custom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obedience and loyalty: Corresponding to the above-mentioned Indian workplace custom of &quot;recruitment kickbacks&quot;, Indian employees are highly obedient to their superiors. Their subordinates are very good at communicating with their leaders. They will often ask their leaders: What else do you need from me? What am I not doing well? What can you do to be more satisfied? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have hired Indians, you will feel that they are generally more submissive, reliable, and secure, and leaders will gradually feel comfortable appointing and promoting them. One way of saying it is that Indian people often shake their heads slightly (to express approval and obedience) and say: I see, I see (I understand). It is known as &quot;Ah San, Ah San&quot; by Chinese people. Another theory is that Asan is &quot;Asir&quot;. At that time, the British often recruited Indians to serve as police officers in the colonies or concessions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People recruited by themselves are more capable, less likely to get into trouble, and less likely to cheat. This is also the reason why Indian executives dare to recruit subordinates of the same race. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resilience: Americans love to mock their government as useless and their president as incompetent. In the eyes of Indians, their own country and government are even worse. In order to survive in their own country, Indians have learned to persevere and make full use of limited resources to live under endless harsh conditions. This ability makes Indian employees more hardworking and hardworking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humility: As new immigrants from a backward and poor society, Indians understand and admit their limitations and deficiencies in many aspects. Therefore, they are more humble and open-minded during the learning process, making it easier for them to integrate into the local area and be accepted by the local society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Educational advantages in technology and engineering fields: As a late-developing country, India&#39;s education is similar to that in East Asia, with more emphasis on science and technology, engineering and other science and engineering courses. It is particularly distinctive in fields such as computers, engineering, and technological innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Indian Institute of Technology&quot; even boasts that &quot;those who cannot get into Indian Institute of Technology should go to MIT.&quot; This is of course bragging, but the large number of science and engineering talents it has trained have just made up for the excessive wealth in the English-speaking world. After a long period of peace, more and more wealthy young people no longer want to study hard to study science and engineering, but study &quot;literature, history, philosophy and arts&quot;. ” and other weaknesses of so-called “rich people’s disciplines”. The &quot;rich N generation&quot; in Europe and the United States learn the art of maintaining success and the method of controlling people, while the science and engineering talents from India serve as CEOs, directors, managers, technological elites... to achieve their own class jump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dare to take risks and start a business: Indian individuals are more willing to take risks and start a business. They are more willing to set up their own companies and serve as CEOs after they grow. This entrepreneurial tendency has made them achieve great success in the business world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Indians are moving from the business world to the political world, and the jokes about &quot;dominating&quot; the world are gradually becoming serious: British Prime Minister Sunak, Singaporean President Shanmugaratnam, Irish Prime Minister Varadkar, Portuguese Prime Minister Costa, and the President of Mauritius Roopun, Prime Minister Jugnauth, Guyana President Irfaan Ali, Suriname President Santokhi, etc. are all Indians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are currently too many Indian cabinet members in the U.S. government: Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State, White House Chip Advisor and U.S. Commerce The department’s chief economist, deputy director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, senior White House staff and presidential speech writers are all Indians. However, Indians only account for 1.4% of the U.S. population. With such a small population weight, they can leverage such huge political influence. Leverage affects the national policies of the United States and even the direction of world politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The idea that Indian elites &quot;dominate&quot; the world is a joke to many people, but the trend cannot be underestimated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 12:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[有奖征集 | 鲁迅的哪些话，让你印象深刻？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257549]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In fifty-five years of life, I have left behind countless words.

The award will also announce the winning projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Several of this year’s alternative Nobel Prizes just announced are related to human health and life. First, the Public Health Award goes to Stanford urologist Park Seung-min for his invention of the Stanford toilet: a &quot;smart toilet&quot; that can monitor health conditions such as urinary tract infections, diabetes and others by analyzing a user&#39;s urine and feces. signs of disease. Additionally, toilet-mounted sensors can identify users based on the unique characteristics of each person&#39;s anus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second prize in medicine was awarded to the team of Natasha Mesinkovska, a dermatologist at the University of California, Irvine. He and his team members carefully observed the noses of human corpses and determined whether there were the same number of nasal hairs in each nostril. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Alternative Nobel Prize has been awarded since 1991. It is an interesting imitation of the Nobel Prize and rewards achievements in 10 aspects. Its name comes from the combination of Ignoble and Nobel Prize. The organizer is the scientific humor magazine &quot;Annals of Improbable Research&quot; (Annals of Improbable Research), and some of the judges are real Nobel Prize winners. The aim is to select studies that &quot;make you laugh at first and then thought-provoking&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2023 Alternative Nobel Prize for Public Health is not just laughable, but indeed innovative and practical. Disease prevention is better than disease treatment, this is the consensus of everyone. Annual physical exams are just a means of prevention. But even this kind of physical examination is considered daunting by many people, because it is not only troublesome to draw blood, defecate and defecate (urinate and defecate), but also requires a special visit to a hospital or physical examination company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the invention of smart toilets may solve these problems and make physical examinations easier, especially for urine and feces examinations, which can predict and predict people&#39;s physical conditions and what diseases may occur. sign. Urine itself can reflect various conditions of the urinary system. When inflammation, stones, tuberculosis, tumors, kidney transplant rejection, renal failure, etc. occur, the composition of urine will change; when certain diseases cause changes in blood composition, Corresponding changes in the composition of urine may also occur, such as diabetes, pancreatitis, jaundice, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stool can reflect more conditions of the body. You can know whether there is inflammation and infection in the digestive tract and the bile ducts leading to the digestive tract, including parasitic infections; There is no bleeding caused by lesions, and when colon tumors or ulcerative colitis occur, bloody stools are the main symptom; the fecal occult blood test (chemical method or immunological method) can detect bleeding that cannot be identified with the naked eye, and can also be used as the first step in the general screening of digestive tract tumors. Screening means; through bacterial culture or microscopy, the intestinal tract can be checked for pathogenic bacteria (such as typhoid bacilli, salmonella, dysentery bacilli) to prevent and treat intestinal infectious diseases; it can assist in the diagnosis of certain hepatobiliary diseases, such as obstructive jaundice The stool is clay-colored, and small stones can be detected in the stool when suffering from cholelithiasis; the digestion status of food in the gastrointestinal tract can be understood. For example, oil droplets in the stool indicate maldigestion and absorption of fat, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The smart toilet comprehensively detects and quickly analyzes human excrement through a series of high-end technologies such as test strips, computer vision systems, cameras, and image recognition. It also combines artificial intelligence, so it can detect the size of a person. It&#39;s fast and convenient. However, what needs to be confirmed is whether the detection results of this smart toilet are accurate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This detection is similar to the original invention to detect cell-free DNA (cfDNA). cfDNA is a DNA fragment discharged into the blood by human cells, with a length of about 167 base pairs. The content in the blood is very low, and it mainly comes from dead somatic cells. Cancer patients have higher cfDNA content in the blood, which comes from dead tumor cells in their bodies. These cfDNA from tumors are called circulating tumors (ctDNA), which can be used as one of the biomarkers for detecting cancer. Now many medical examination companies have also launched ctDNA testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another function of cfDNA is to detect fetal abnormalities. Human embryos will also discharge some DNA into the blood, called cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA), which enters the maternal blood circulation through apoptotic trophoblast cells shed from placental tissue. In 1997, Professor Lo Yuk-ming from Hong Kong, China, discovered that cffDNA could be extracted from the blood of pregnant women to diagnose fetal malformations, such as congenital dementia (Down syndrome). He is also known as the founder of non-invasive DNA prenatal testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;non-invasive prenatal diagnosis&quot; (NIPT) technology invented by Lu Yuming has been widely used in more than 60 countries and regions around the world for many years. Because this kind of test is simpler and more user-friendly, it does not require a large amount of blood to be drawn or amniotic fluid puncture, which saves pregnant women a lot of trouble and risks. For this reason, Lu Yuming was awarded the &quot;2022 Lasker Clinical Medicine Award&quot;. This is one of the most prestigious awards in the medical field, known as the &quot;Nobel Weather Vane&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the smart toilet that won the Alternative Nobel Prize this year can accurately diagnose urinary tract infections, diabetes and even tumors by analyzing the user&#39;s urine and feces, it will undoubtedly be the first Alternative Nobel Prize in recent years. The trend is that this award will become more and more practical, not just what people think of as &quot;funny&quot;. As for whether it will become another benchmark for the Nobel Prize, that is another matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[又丧气又温暖，这纪录片真神奇]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257434]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;In 2021, Martin Scorsese once He teamed up with Netflix to produce a biographical comedy documentary &quot;Pretend This Is a City.&quot; The film stars Martin&#39;s longtime friend, writer and critic Fran Lebowitz. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fran, who has a strong intellectual aura, is enough to make those who love her happy when she walks on the streets of New York.

Among them, the &quot;Basic Funeral Services&quot; refusal to trade dispute case involves the identification and legal liability of public enterprises&#39; refusal to trade, which is worth mentioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the website of the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the basic facts of this typical case are: Quanzhou Licheng Lisheng Funeral Service Co., Ltd. (Lisheng Company), which is mainly engaged in funeral intermediary services, sued for the prosecution of Quanzhou Jiying Funeral Service Co., Ltd. (Jiying Company) is a public enterprise that provides basic funeral services such as cremation of remains. Because Lisheng Company reported that Jiying Company charged illegally, Jiying Company refused Lisheng Company to apply for cremation services on behalf of the relatives of the deceased, which violated the regulations. In accordance with the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law prohibiting administrative monopoly, we requested a court to order Jiying Company to resume handling relevant business for Lisheng Company and to compensate for economic losses of 80,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court of first instance held that Lisheng Company failed to prove that Jiying Company was the executive entity of the administrative monopoly regulated by the Anti-Monopoly Law, and ruled to reject all claims of Lisheng Company. Lisheng Company was dissatisfied and appealed, claiming that Jiying Company&#39;s refusal was an abuse of market dominance prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law. The second instance of the Supreme Court found that Jiying Company, as a public enterprise with a monopoly position in the basic funeral service market in central Quanzhou, refused to handle relevant business for Lisheng Company, constituting a refusal to trade prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law, and ruled that Jiying Company Compensate Lisheng Company for losses of RMB 80,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trial process of this case is very interesting. In the first instance, Lisheng Company held that Jiying Company&#39;s refusal to trade with it violated the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law prohibiting administrative monopoly. The court of first instance held that Lisheng Company failed to prove that Jiying Company was the executive entity of the administrative monopoly regulated by the Anti-Monopoly Law, so it rejected Lisheng Company&#39;s appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what are the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law on administrative monopoly? According to Chapter 5 of the Anti-Monopoly Law, administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs shall not abuse administrative power to exclude or restrict competition. From a legal perspective, the implementing entities of administrative monopoly should be “administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs.” On the surface, Jiying Company is an enterprise, not an administrative agency, and is not authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs. It does not seem qualified to be the subject of administrative monopoly. So what kind of company is Jiying Company? After digging through the layers, it was discovered that Jiying Company is a state-owned company 100% controlled by the Quanzhou State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. More importantly, Jiying Company operates the only funeral parlor in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, funeral parlors in other places are generally public institutions affiliated with the civil affairs department, but Quanzhou City hands over the operation of funeral parlors to a state-owned enterprise. This state-owned enterprise is responsible for providing basic funeral services, including cremation of remains, in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou City. This is the only funeral home in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou that can provide cremation services. According to the reply letter to the CPPCC members&#39; proposal published by the Quanzhou Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau in 2019, the funeral business in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou was transferred to Jiying Group for management. In other words, Jiying Company’s monopoly on the basic funeral service market in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou is the result of administrative transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it legal for a state-owned enterprise that provides basic public services, which is in a monopoly position due to administrative orders, to refuse to trade with a downstream enterprise because it reported that it charged excessively? The court of first instance rejected the plaintiff&#39;s petition on the grounds that the defendant was not a qualified subject of administrative monopoly. There seemed to be nothing wrong with the procedure. However, it objectively maintained Jiying Company&#39;s monopoly status and made it impossible for the plaintiff to carry out normal operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, during the appeal, Lisheng Company changed its strategy and claimed that Jiying Company’s refusal was an abuse of market dominance and refusal to trade. The Supreme Court also held in the second instance that Jiying Company is a public enterprise with an exclusive position in the local basic funeral service market, and the basic funeral services it provides are specific services that are indispensable for the downstream funeral intermediary companies to carry out services, and the downstream funeral agencies There is no alternative to the agency. Jiying Company refused to handle relevant business for Lisheng Company, which resulted in Lisheng Company being completely excluded from the funeral agency service market in downtown Quanzhou, excluding and limiting competition in the funeral agency service market, and damaging its reputation as a countermeasures company. The interests of consumers’ relatives of the deceased in the sense of the Monopoly Law constitute a refusal to trade prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law. Therefore, it was ruled that Jiying Company should resume Lisheng Company’s application for the cremation business on behalf of the relatives of the deceased under legal and compliant conditions, and compensate them The refusal to trade caused a loss of 80,000 yuan to Lisheng Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the relevant judgment documents published on the China Judgment Documents Network, the cause of the incident was a business of renting ice coffins to store remains in October 2019. The plaintiff believed that the defendant had illegally charged an extra 200 yuan in rent. Complaints to market regulatory authorities. After that, the defendant no longer accepted the plaintiff’s application to the defendant for cremation of remains on behalf of the deceased’s family. In order to protect their rights and interests, the plaintiff complained to the Quanzhou Municipal Market Supervision Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, and National Development and Reform Commission, and took the civil affairs, municipal supervision and other departments to court many times for administrative inaction. However, these complaints and lawsuits all failed without exception. Even in the first-instance civil lawsuit heard by the intermediate court in another place, there was still no support. It wasn&#39;t until he appealed to the Supreme Court that he was finally supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar phenomena are not uncommon. Some local governments transfer the responsibility of certain basic public services to state-owned enterprises, which is called marketization and actually forms an administrative monopoly. These state-owned enterprises have an absolute monopoly in this field of public services and may even be assigned some management functions that should be the responsibility of the administrative department. Their leaders are often close to the regulatory authorities. Therefore, these state-owned enterprises are often arrogant when facing downstream enterprises or consumers. Once downstream companies or consumers mess with such state-owned enterprises, they will be put in the shoes of others. Just like in this case, because Lisheng Company complained about Jiying Company&#39;s excessive charges, Jiying Company used the excuse that Lisheng Company violated laws and regulations during the funeral process and refused to allow Lisheng Company to handle the cremation business on behalf of the family of the deceased. However, it is very difficult for downstream companies or consumers to safeguard their rights. Locally, they will basically encounter obstacles everywhere, and they can only be solved at a higher level or even at the central level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this kind of public service provision by enterprises designated by administrative power does not comply with the legal provisions on &quot;administrative monopoly&quot; on the surface, it is essentially the same as administrative monopoly. They both rely on administrative power to monopolize the market. Put on a pair of &quot;corporate&quot; white gloves. These &quot;public enterprises&quot; with monopoly status should not be viewed with caution against administrative monopolies to prevent them from using their monopoly status to harm the interests of upstream and downstream enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
