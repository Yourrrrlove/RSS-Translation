According to its official website, it agreed to the acquisition proposal from private equity firm Roark Capital, with an acquisition price of approximately RMB 70 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the news came out, it immediately became a trending topic. Many foodies left messages lamenting that the fast food chain Big Mac, which had more stores than McDonald&#39;s and KFC at its peak, is no longer popular. Data shows that Subway has been in operating difficulties since 2014. As of November 2022, the number of Subway stores worldwide has decreased by nearly 8,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In China, Subway&#39;s stores are mainly concentrated in first- and second-tier cities. A sandwich sells for 30 yuan. It focuses on being &quot;healthier&quot; than ordinary fast food. It has been famous for providing freshly customized sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. It is widely popular in weight loss and fitness circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as competition in the catering industry intensifies, under the name of health, waves of ketogenic diets, meal replacements, and sugar replacements come one after another, and various &quot;fat-reducing diets&quot; &quot;Meals&quot; are emerging one after another. Gradually, Subway&#39;s sandwiches have lost their originality and are no longer fashionable in the eyes of Chinese foodies who pursue healthy consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;An endless stream of weight loss meals&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to successfully lose weight, people take great pains in their diet, and this can always be captured by keen merchants, so over the years, diets in the name of weight loss have Wave after wave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meal replacement is quite popular nowadays. Meal replacement, as the name suggests, can replace part or all of the main meals. It is a type of food that quickly, conveniently and quantitatively provides the human body with appropriate amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber and other necessary nutrients. There are meal replacement powders and meal replacement milks. Shakes, meal replacement porridge, meal replacement snacks, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meal replacement was initially targeted at patients with specific diseases, astronauts, mountaineers and other people. Later, it quickly became popular among weight loss people, and the market scale expanded rapidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Tmall statistics, sales of meal replacement light food products in 2021 increased by 290% year-on-year. The number of meal replacement consumers increased by 78% in three years, and the per capita annual consumption amount has exceeded 3,000 yuan. . Statistics from global market research company Euromonitor International show that in 2017, China&#39;s meal replacement market size was approximately 57.17 billion yuan, and is expected to reach 120 billion yuan in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Substitute sugar is similar to meal replacement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugar substitutes have a sweetness similar to sucrose, but do not produce calories or have very low calories. This is most common in beverages and snacks, which are all labeled with &quot;zero sugar&quot; and &quot;zero calories&quot; to tell consumers that they can satisfy their cravings without gaining weight. For example, drinks represented by Yuanqi Forest under the banner of &quot;zero sugar&quot; adjust the taste by adding sugar substitutes &quot;erythritol&quot; and &quot;sucralose&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the stereotype of some dieters, sugar and carbohydrates are the main culprits of obesity, so in addition to avoiding sugar, some people also do everything possible to reduce or even eliminate carbohydrates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ketogenic diet, which rejects all carbohydrates, has become popular. The traditional Chinese eating habits are too high in carbohydrates, and the ketogenic diet goes to the other extreme: only eating lean meats and vegetables, and not eating staple foods containing carbohydrates, thereby producing a large amount of ketone bodies and forcing the body to burn fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next step is the fat-reducing meal. Simply put, it is a meal that can reduce fat. It is generally less oil, less salt, and low in calories. Unlike the ketogenic diet, its nutrition is relatively balanced. Most diets for weight loss are not delicious. Fat-reduction meals now stand out on social platforms because they can be &quot;delicious&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, some people found hope in the burgers and fried chicken of the carbohydrate giant. On the one hand, burgers and chicken legs can not only provide excellent protein and necessary fat for the human body, but on the other hand, their calories are not as high as imagined. For example, some burgers only have 450 calories. The daily caloric intake of adult women in my country is about 1,800 kilocalories, and that of adult men is 2,250 kilocalories, so eating a hamburger for one meal is not a big problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with other weight-loss meals, fat-reducing meals are becoming a major source of traffic on social platforms. Other weight-loss meals can basically only be bought from merchants, which are unpalatable and expensive. However, fat-loss meals are suitable for DIY. There are a wide variety of menus to share on social platforms, and all kinds of food are available. They are delicious and can help you lose weight, so why not for? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/af1c4b7c289a7bcdee642927260594ac.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/af1c4b7c289a7bcdee642927260594ac.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251104&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It may not work&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;But, can Internet celebrity weight loss meals really help you lose weight? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, many Internet celebrity weight loss meals are specious and just seek psychological comfort. For example, the various meal replacement snacks that have become popular in the past two years, such as oatmeal brittle, compressed biscuits, cereal yogurt, and instant corn flakes, are not low in sugar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although some sugar substitute biscuits replace sucrose with sugar substitute and wheat flour with coarse grain flour rich in dietary fiber, the main ingredient is still starch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is the popular salad set on the takeout platform, which is piled with vegetables, fruits and some meat, and looks very healthy. In fact, although fruits supplement vitamins, their sugar content is not low; avocados are not low in fat; a few grains of purple/brown rice just look like whole grains and are probably refined carbohydrates; more importantly, there are various sauces that enhance the taste. Ingredients, the calories are very likely to explode...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salad sets on takeout platforms often do not provide accurate energy tables, but merchants with little nutrition knowledge prepare them at will, and consumers spend more money. Just buy a psychological comfort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if it may not work, Internet celebrity weight loss meals may also bring health risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, although meal replacement is a way to supplement nutrients and reduce energy intake, the nutrients in meal replacement cannot replace a balanced diet, and studies have shown that long-term consumption of meal replacement shakes , will affect intestinal peristalsis, reduce metabolism, and in severe cases may cause endocrine disorders in the body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for sugar substitute products. After eating sugar, the human body will automatically undergo a glucose metabolism reaction. If you eat sugar substitutes but do not take in the required calories, the normal glucose metabolism reaction will be weakened, resulting in a subsequent decrease in glucose tolerance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ketogenic diet carries greater risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the standards of the &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents&quot;, 55%-65% of adults&#39; daily energy intake should come from carbohydrates. A ketogenic diet that refuses carbohydrates will cause insufficient energy for the body, leading to side effects such as fatigue, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and irregular heartbeat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A study in &quot;The Lancet&quot; showed that there is a U-shaped relationship between carbohydrate intake and life expectancy. A low-carbohydrate diet will reduce life expectancy by up to 4 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest bug with various fat-reducing meals is that we can eat them for a month to achieve the goal of reducing fat, but can we eat them for a lifetime? Once it fails, the next problem will be: rebound. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior nutritionist pointed out: &quot;A single food weight loss method actually deviates from a healthy dietary pattern. The result is that the more you reduce your basal metabolism, the lower your basal metabolism will be, and the rebound will be more severe.&quot; Long-term deficit habit The body will fully absorb them when exposed to carbohydrates and fats to help the body return to normal operating levels, and the weight will rebound quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Isn&#39;t this just &quot;losing your wife and losing your troops&quot;? The operation was as fierce as a tiger, but in the end it returned to the same way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/3710cf01919af6f3692376196c081165.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/3710cf01919af6f3692376196c081165.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251108&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Shut up and open your legs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is the truly effective way to lose weight? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is the clichéd six words, &quot;Shut up and open your legs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keeping your mouth shut does not mean not to eat, but it means to control your diet appropriately and ensure a balanced diet. The &quot;Reference Intake of Dietary Nutrients for Chinese Residents&quot; clearly states: The recommended dietary energy supply ratio for adults is 50%-65% carbohydrates, 20%-30% fat, and 10%-15% protein. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humans are not machines. Only by consuming sufficient and balanced nutrients can normal metabolism be maintained. Of course, overeating is not advisable, but if you diet blindly, once the intake cannot cover the basal metabolism, it will have a negative effect on the body, causing muscle and bone loss. Therefore, any kind of weight loss meal must be based on health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person’s fatness or thinness is not only related to the total daily caloric intake, but also related to the total daily caloric consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there is a calorie surplus, the body will gain weight. If calorie consumption is greater than calorie intake, then the body will lose weight. To successfully lose weight, your total energy intake should be less than your total energy expenditure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many internet celebrity weight loss meals focus on reducing intake, but their low energy intake has fallen below the bottom line of health. The healthy fat loss formula is: caloric consumption >; caloric intake >; calories required for basal metabolism. The body&#39;s caloric deficit is between 10% and 15% of total consumption. The best way to burn calories is to spread your legs and move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So it’s better to just “keep your mouth shut and open your legs” if you follow all kinds of celebrity weight-loss meals on the Internet and the prices are quite low. Maintaining a normal and balanced diet while ensuring a certain amount of exercise may not make you lose weight immediately, but it will give you a well-proportioned figure and a healthy body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[如何评价历史人物？从“被泼脏水”的隋炀帝说起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256914]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Over the years, there are probably very few &quot;tyrants&quot; in history who have not been demonstrated by researchers or history buffs He is &quot;actually a talented and strategic monarch&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed, the images of many &quot;tyrants&quot; left in history books, especially their images in traditional literature, are often far from their historical prototypes. After a change of dynasty, if the new dynasty wants to prove its legitimacy, the history books will throw dirty water on it. The identity of the &quot;tyrant&quot; has been recognized, and folk literature and art like to use him to tell erotic and violent stories - after all, deep in human nature, there is such a hobby, but it is not appropriate to place this hobby on a good person, so the &quot;tyrant&quot; &quot;It&#39;s always good to make it very pornographic and violent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fate of popular emperors in literary and artistic works such as Shang Zhou and Sui Yang Emperor is probably always like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the question is, peel off the outer layer of skin, what is the inner layer exposed? Let’s take Emperor Yang of Sui Dynasty as an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty first came to the throne, he inherited a powerful empire that had not been seen for hundreds of years after the fall of the Han Dynasty, and it was also a huge powder keg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, long-term divisions have been unified in a very short period of time, and some people are dissatisfied with the current regime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, his father, Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty, had some important institutional reforms and policy practices, which were very beneficial from the national level, but felt uncomfortable at the social level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the household registration management in the Sui Dynasty was particularly good. According to official population statistics, the population has increased from 29 million to 46 million in less than 30 years. These 17 million people are definitely not just the result of everyone trying their best to have children when the world is at peace, but the population that was originally hidden has all been plundered. From the perspective of the imperial court, the country had extremely abundant manpower and material resources at its disposal. However, if you look at the perspective of ordinary people at that time, these people did not have to pay taxes or serve in the military. Now all these burdens have been placed on them, and they are not necessarily happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If these people are all in disarray, there is nothing they can do even if they are dissatisfied. But Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty also made another major reform, which was to change the three-level local administration of state-prefecture-county to the second-level state-county administration, and abolish the county level. As a result, tens of thousands of people, from county chiefs to ordinary officials, were about to be laid off. From a national level, this is reducing staff and increasing efficiency. But with so many officials losing their vested interests, they will definitely be furious. If the Sui Dynasty returned all the savings to the people, then the people should be very happy to see these people lose their official positions. But the problem is that the Sui Dynasty concentrated all the profits in the court, and the people of the Sui Dynasty did not get any benefits from this reform that could have benefited them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above two reforms, together with other new policies, resulted in a great increase in the income of the Sui Dynasty and a decrease in expenditure. Therefore, many scholars have noticed that when it comes to ancient dynasties, it is said that In terms of &quot;national wealth&quot;, it is unmatched by the Sui Dynasty. But at the same time, this also means that as long as someone wants to rebel, there will immediately be tens of thousands of unemployed officials with administrative organizational skills, and tens of millions of dissatisfied people who can take advantage of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty was completely unaware of the existence of this problem. He was from a good background, had a smooth life since childhood, and was really smart. He had no ability to empathize with the pain of ordinary people. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He only saw that there were so many resources in the court now, so he wanted to do big things, so he dug the Grand Canal and conquered Liaodong three times, which were all extreme tests of social endurance. It was not that Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty did not feel that his throne was threatened, but it was not from this huge powder keg, but from the Guanlong Group that the Sui Dynasty relied on for its success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming emperor, Emperor Sui Yang was particularly successful in commanding the war in the south. His ability to win over the southern nobles far exceeded that of the older generation of famous generals and ministers of the Guanlong Group. This gave him the illusion that I have new forces available, and you are nothing special. This intensified the division of the ruling group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, the excluded Guanlong dignitaries at the top, the laid-off officials at the middle level, and the ordinary people at the grassroots level who are overwhelmed by heavy labor and taxes will have full anger from top to bottom. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Sui Yang was indeed not the nymphomaniac or sadist in literary works, but when faced with the challenge, he seemed completely unqualified as a politician. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You are too willful when things are going well. I don’t want you to think so. I want you to think that you can’t do things and never give up even if you hit a wall. But when it comes to adversity, they lack resilience and willpower, and their willpower collapses immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world was in chaos. When Emperor Sui Yang arrived in Jiangdu, he actually no longer expected to recapture the north. But his troops were all from the north, and they were afraid of not going back, so they were discussing rebellion. A palace maid heard the news and told Queen Xiao. Empress Xiao is still very smart, so you can speak for yourself. As soon as the result was mentioned, Emperor Sui Yang became furious. Are you qualified to say this? Just kill this palace maid. Later, there were more and more news that the army was going to rebel. Queen Xiao told the people in the palace that there was no need to talk to His Majesty. Why add to his worries? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in terms of the combat effectiveness of Emperor Sui Yang&#39;s army at that time, it was still very powerful, but at the last moment of his life, Emperor Sui Yang had given up treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The summary is that as a political figure, Emperor Sui Yang:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, he was unable to reconcile complex political and social contradictions;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Failed to build a core team that was loyal to itself and capable;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, there was no awareness of changing course when the situation started to go unfavorable;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, there was no persistence when the situation was very unfavorable. will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the things he did, such as building the Grand Canal, you might as well look at it this way: When discussing long-term history, even if a person is an emperor, his influence may not be that important. The study of factors such as finance and taxation, technology diffusion, productivity, economic and social structure is enough to explain the problem, and it might as well not involve character evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To evaluate a character, you need to look at the history of a short period of time. A short period of time in the historical sense is a lifetime for ordinary people. The great social collapse of the late Sui Dynasty triggered by Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty caused the death and displacement of tens of millions of people. This is real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, traditional history books and literary works often apply too much paint to characters. This problem does exist. But if you think the truth is revealed by turning traditional records over, you might as well save it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人贩余华英获死刑，受害家庭：“几十年的辛酸，终于清楚了”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256948]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 10:16:43&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/19/f6b4e7615e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 19/f6b4e7615e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251151&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, Yu Huaying was charged with child trafficking. Sentenced to death. (Guiyang Intermediate People&#39;s Court/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, the Guiyang Intermediate People&#39;s Court publicly pronounced the verdict on the crime of child abduction and trafficking against the defendant Yu Huaying. Yu Huaying was sentenced to death for child abduction, deprived of political rights for life, and confiscated all personal property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the video shot by the media, Yang Niuhua read the verdict to the parents looking for relatives at the door of the court, hoping that they could all see hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Niuhua was abducted and trafficked by Yu Huaying when she was 5 years old. She successfully found her relatives 25 years later. In 2022, Yang Niuhua reported the case to the police and provided clues, and the child abduction and trafficking case of Yu Huaying was officially filed. (For details, please see the relevant report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/253854?source=134&quot;>;Human trafficker Yu Huaying was sentenced to death: abducted 11 children and also sold her own son&lt;/a a>;》)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The trial by Guiyang Intermediate People’s Court found that the defendant Yu Huaying collaborated with Gong Mouliang (deceased) from 1993 to 1996 for profit Illegal interests circulated in Guizhou Province, Chongqing City and other places, looking for suitable children to abduct and traffic. After they succeeded, the two took the abducted children to Handan City, Hebei Province, and through the introduction of Wang Moufu and Yang Moulan, they found a buyer for the sale. , profiting from this, during which a total of 11 children were abducted. The Guiyang Intermediate Court held that the defendant Yu Huaying had repeatedly abducted and trafficked children in order to obtain illegal profits. His behavior constituted the crime of child abduction. The crime was particularly serious and extremely harmful to society and should be severely punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yu Huaying appealed in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I hope she will die, but I don’t want her to die”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although it was only a first-instance verdict, Cai Huiying, a family member of the victim who attended the sentencing, Feeling devastated, she told her relatives on the phone: &quot;We have finally figured it out after decades of hardship and fatigue. We finally understand.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;After Cai Huiying walked out of the court, she started calling her family. The first one is the abducted party - his younger brother Cai Zhansheng. Cai Shengsheng was 6 years old when he was abducted in Zunyi and disappeared with his brother. A few months later, the elder brother came back alone without seeing his younger brother. It was not until the end of 2022, after the Yu Huaying case was filed, that Cai Shengsheng went home through DNA comparison. Thirty years later, Cai Zhansheng can no longer remember many details, but he still remembers Yu Huaying with high cheekbones and a long face. Cai Huiying said that her brother was also very happy to learn that Yu Huaying was sentenced to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cai Huiying called her parents for the second time. After his younger brother was lost, his father insisted on going out to look for his relatives for more than 20 years, traveling to Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Henan, Jiangxi and other places. Wherever there was news, my father immediately went out to verify it. He went out with hope again and again, but his hope was shattered again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Logically speaking, my father should hate Yu Huaying very much. But two months ago, when my father learned that the prosecutor recommended the death penalty for Yu Huaying in the first trial, &quot;the first sentence he said was that I hope she (Yu Huaying) dies, but I don&#39;t want her to die.&quot; Cai&#39;s father hopes that Yu Huaying will be sentenced to death because she has brought endless harm and pain to his family; he does not want her to die, but he wants to give her some time to tell the story of the children who have been abducted and trafficked over the years, so that more parents can Find the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cai Huiying replied to her father: &quot;This is our common idea, but can she do it?&quot; Cai Huiying once attended the first trial. At that time, Yu Hua Ying expressed that he was &quot;unclear&quot; and &quot;cannot remember&quot; many of the circumstances of the crime. Only when talking about his son and daughter, Yu Huaying burst into tears and choked with sobs. This made Cai Huiying quite angry, and she clenched her fists from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yu Huaying abducted 11 children, involving 8 families. This time the court pronounced its verdict, and relatives from five families came to listen. One mother had two sons abducted, another mother had a son and a daughter abducted, and yet another mother had a son abducted. When Cai Huiying saw the mother who came from Zunyi, after Yu Huaying was sentenced to death, she stood up with excitement and seemed to want to beat her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During lunch, Cai Huiying chatted with several mothers about their respective situations: the children of five families were recovered one after another after Yang Niuhua reported the crime. However, the relationship between the biological family and the foster family is quite complex. Some abducted children find it difficult to cope with the situation, fail to accept family recognition, and rarely come back for reunions. &quot;But we are all grateful to Niuhua, because she reported the crime and we were able to find our relatives.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The regret of broken family ties has appeared in many victim families. In Dazu, Chongqing, Bai Ticai, whose son was abducted by Yu Huaying, was completely unaware of the court verdict.

Everyone held a family-searching information board in front of their chests, on which the information about the abducted children was printed in the most conspicuous yellow letters on a red background. The children were still young when they were abducted, and the printed photos show them when they were one or two years old, and most of them are blurry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the court hearing in July, Southern Weekend reporters saw An Shiming, who came to search for his son. He came to the court door early holding a family search information board to broadcast live. This time when the verdict was announced, he once again came early with some parents looking for relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Cai Huiying arrived before 8 o&#39;clock, more parents saw this search than at the first trial. She stood far away and did not dare to walk into the crowd. &quot;I felt that as soon as I stood there and heard what they said, I naturally couldn&#39;t control the emotion.&quot; For parents who are still looking for relatives, Cai Huiying feels that what she can say is feeble: &quot;Have more courage and continue.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Niuhua Dare to speak to parents looking for relatives. In a live media broadcast after the trial, she once again encouraged parents looking for their children not to give up. She mentioned her own example: the first time she took blood to find her relatives was in 2012, but there has been no news in the past ten years. But in 2021, in just over a month, she miraculously found her home through the short video platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After finding a home, Yang Niuhua lived in Hebei, Yu Huaying was in Chongqing, and the trafficking case occurred in Guizhou. The three places were far apart. It seemed that it was very difficult to find human traffickers. Disaster. But now, Yu Huaying has been punished by law. &quot;Really never give up,&quot; Yang Niuhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before and after every court session, Yang Niuhua’s schedule is tight and busy. On the one hand, families looking for relatives hope to take this opportunity to spread the information about finding relatives, and find her to live broadcast and record videos together; on the other hand, media interviews continue, and Yang Niuhua repeatedly recounts her experience of being abducted and the hardships of growing up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sister Sang Ying felt a little distressed when she saw Yang Niuhua always rushing ahead. Both sisters were actually victims. After Yang Niuhua was abducted in 1995, her parents were extremely sad and died in 1997 and 1998 respectively. Sangying lost her home and was forced to go out to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电诈受害者的银行卡困境:报案后要被冻结多久]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256940]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/2ea2e16682.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/2ea2e16682. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251128&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 10, 2023, the Beijing police were promoting anti-email fraud. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a week of being defrauded of more than 30,000 yuan, Shenzhen citizen Li Zheng kept asking the police, The bank proved that she was sober and would no longer transfer money to the scammer. On the day she was defrauded, all the debit cards and credit cards in her name were taken protective stop-payment measures by the police and could not be used. The reason was to prevent her from being deceived again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called protective stop payment means that in order to protect the victim from further losses, the payment function of the bank card is stopped. Only transfers can be made, but transfers and cash withdrawals cannot be made. The customer service of Li Zheng&#39;s bank card bank informed him that the one-month payment stop measure for bank accounts that are likely to be defrauded again is consistent across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protective stop payment suddenly made Li Zheng unable to use her bank card to buy groceries, take a car, or even pay school fees for her children. She felt extremely inconvenienced. She found that she was not the only one trying to lift the protective stop payment. There were victims across the country who encountered the same problem. Many of them were still burdened with mortgages and were so anxious that they didn&#39;t know what to do. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The card was frozen after taking the initiative to report the crime&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 7, 2023, Li Zheng was on the noisy street when she received a fraud call. The other party asked her to confirm that her social account was in the security center. The &quot;million protection insurance&quot; is not free. Li Zheng hurried to do things and didn&#39;t want to pay attention to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person on the other end of the phone said it would only take a few minutes, just follow the instructions to confirm. Li Zheng listened to the other party&#39;s voice on the road, and responded intermittently. He downloaded a &quot;bank APP&quot; according to the other party&#39;s request, entered different business numbers and order numbers back and forth, and tried to see whether the transfer was successful, starting from 7 yuan to 8 yuan. Small transfers ranging from RMB 20,000 to large transfers of more than 20,000 yuan. After turning the corner and walking into a secluded place, she suddenly realized that she had been cheated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng immediately hung up on the scammer and dialed 110 to call the police. At this time, she had transferred more than 30,000 yuan to the scammer, and she didn&#39;t know whether she could get it back. The Futian Police Station of the Futian Branch of the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau quickly received the call and called her to wait where she was for the time being. A police car would be sent to pick her up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Police from the police station took her for questioning and taking notes. Li Zheng said that at that time, the police only froze the suspect&#39;s account and did not mention that they would implement a protective stop payment on his bank card. The police also uploaded the report details to the national anti-fraud APP, and you can also see relevant information when you log in later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 9 o&#39;clock that night, police officers from the Nanshan Branch Merchants Police Station where Li Zheng lived came to her door, asked her if she had been defrauded, and spread anti-fraud knowledge to her. Li Zheng thought that the handling of the fraud case had come to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when she was about to pay with her mobile phone the next day, she discovered that the two debit cards and one credit card in her name could no longer be used. After consulting the account bank, she learned that it was a protective stop payment operated by the anti-fraud police and was frozen for one month according to regulations. If she wanted to lift it, she could consult the Nanshan Branch Anti-Fraud Center. However, Li Zheng found that the call was not easy to get through, so he complained through the national anti-fraud hotline 96110. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Li Zheng received police calls from Futian Police Station, Shenzhen Public Security Bureau, and Futian Branch. The answers they received were all &quot;In order to protect you from being deceived again, your bank card needs to be frozen for one month.&quot; Li Zheng did not agree with this. She took the initiative to report the crime when she realized that she had been deceived, and she also suffered property losses. &quot;How could it be possible to transfer money to the scammer again?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believed that the stop-payment measure had caused her many problems. It is inconvenient that bank cards are needed for food and clothing at home and for company transactions. Now everything is &quot;immobilized&quot;. However, the credit card still needs to be repaid and may face the risk of overdue payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 11, at Li Zheng’s strong request, the police accompanied her to withdraw more than 7,000 yuan from two cards. Despite this, she believes that it is still difficult to maintain daily life because the debit card cannot be transferred and the credit card cannot be used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, a reporter from Southern Weekend called the Anti-Fraud Center of the Nanshan Branch to inquire. The staff of the Anti-Fraud Center stated that the bank card under Li Zheng’s name was indeed in a “protective stop payment” status and would stop payment within 48 hours. The payment will continue to circulate until one month. How to cancel it can be consulted with the Nanshan Branch. But before that, Li Zheng had communicated with the Nanshan Branch Investment Police Station many times, but the payment stop could not be lifted. Futian branch police told Southern Weekend reporters that what Li Zheng encountered was an ordinary telecommunications fraud case. The matter of lifting the protective stop payment has been communicated and coordinated with the Nanshan branch. More details of the case cannot be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Li Zheng rushed between two police stations, she discovered that the situation she encountered was not an isolated case. There were many victims of electronic fraud at the scene who came to complain about frozen bank cards. On the Internet, there are also victims on various social media asking how to lift the protective stop payment. Their ID addresses include Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, etc.: &quot;The stop payment on the 21st of last month has not been lifted yet. Do you know how to deal with it? &quot;I still have bank mortgages affected&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The original intention is to prevent &quot;obsession&quot;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Guo Zhi, a lawyer at Beijing Yingke (Shenzhen) Law Firm Hao has been paying attention to card unfreezing cases for a long time and provides legal consultation on unfreezing cards. According to his understanding, the protective stop payment originally originated from the &quot;card disconnection&quot; operation in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public information, on October 10, 2020, the State Council convened an inter-ministerial joint meeting to combat new illegal crimes in telecommunications networks and decided to launch a nationwide &quot;card disconnection&quot; operation from that date. The main purpose is to deal with a major root cause of the continued high incidence of telecom network fraud - the out-of-control management of phone cards and bank cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Guo Zhihao said that after the &quot;card disconnection&quot; campaign began, the number of bank cards frozen due to the inflow of unknown funds increased. He received hundreds of inquiries about unfreezing cards a week, among which protection Inquiries about sexual cessation of payment also appear occasionally, but the overall proportion is low. From 2020 to 2022, among the 100 cases inquiring about unfreezing cards, only one or two were protective stop payments; since 2023, the number of consultations on such cases has increased, with four or five out of 100 cases. Regarding the protective stop payment, Guo Zhihao suggested that if the client does not need to use the bank card urgently, there is no need to find a lawyer to represent him, because most of them will be automatically lifted after one month, and &quot;the tossing and tossing is only a week or two in advance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the reason for the increase in the number of stop-payment inquiries, Guo Zhihao did not find any new public documents in 2023. It should only be implementation adjustments in individual regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that since June 2023, public security agencies in many places across the country have issued the &quot;Notice on Carrying out Anti-Fraud Dissuasion and Protective Emergency Stop of Payments&quot;, in which the time and method of lifting the payment stop are specified. Different expressions: The Yuanzhou Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Yichun City, Jiangxi Province mentioned in an announcement on June 7: “If you have transferred money to the account involved in fraud, the branch will immediately implement a protective stop payment on your account, 48 It can be lifted on your own after an hour.&quot;; The Public Security Bureau of Xining City, Qinghai Province reminded in an announcement in August: &quot;If the bank account under your name only accepts payments but does not pay, please go to the nearest public security agency as soon as possible to explain the situation and request to lift the suspension. Pay and restore the normal use of the bank card.&quot; Guo Zhihao believes that the original intention of stopping payments in various places is the same, to prevent victims from being obsessed with transferring money to fraudulent accounts again, but there are no clear regulations on implementation standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter contacted a victim who had been &quot;obsessed&quot; during the interview. Chen Qiang, a 27-year-old doctoral student in Guangzhou, was deeply involved in an investment and stock fraud group in July. It was a well-designed scam. When opening an account, the other party could verify it via video. The transfer provided was a third-party public account, and the company existed and was operating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang was convinced and transferred &quot;investment&quot; to the account for three consecutive days. On July 19, the anti-fraud police took him to the police station and told him that he was transferring money to an &quot;early warning account.&quot; Chen Qiang didn&#39;t believe it at all. &quot;I can&#39;t be cheated.&quot; The police repeatedly &quot;educated&quot; him for two hours and asked him about his behavior. The account adopts a 48-hour emergency payment stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang was doubtful and told the scammer the information that he had been tipped to be deceived. The scammer first sent him a private message, telling him that he had also been called to the police station because of the company&#39;s bank account risk. The &quot;agency&quot; was currently investigating and it would not affect investment security. The next day, the &quot;agency&quot; issued a processing notice. After several operations, Chen Qiang believed in the liar again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the emergency stop payment, Chen Qiang continued to transfer money to the scammer. It was not until a few days later that the scammer induced him to invest all his money. Chen Qiang suddenly realized that his more than 50,000 yuan had been locked and could not be withdrawn. . Chen Qiang admitted that it took him several days to get out of the scam, and the 48-hour emergency stop payment did play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case is not rare. Wang Xueni, who lives in Zhejiang, was not aware of the problem when she was defrauded on August 11. It was not until the public security organs discovered that the fraudster&#39;s bank account had received transfers from her, prompting her that she was experiencing telecommunications network fraud. On the same day, she went to the police station to be questioned by the police, and all bank cards began to stop payment for 32 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another victim in Guangzhou, Lin Qingqing, was prompted by the police to report the crime to the local police station and take notes. However, Lin Qingqing said that the process of lifting the payment stop went smoothly. After filling out the &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; at the Anti-Fraud Center, police from the police station near her residence came to verify and conduct anti-fraud propaganda. Soon her bank card was unfrozen. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; posted by Lin Qingqing on her social account, in addition to basic information, the form also requires filling in &quot;whether you have met with the police to dissuade you&quot;; The purpose of the stopped payment bank card after the stop payment is lifted. The transaction details must indicate to whom the transfer is to be made, and the reasons for the transfer should be attached. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the process of lifting the payment stop is not smooth for many netizens. On Zhihu, a netizen with an IP address in Jiangxi said that the local police had stopped payment, and after the lifting, over-the-counter transactions were still restricted. A netizen in Jiangsu said that it would take 40 days to lift the local payment stop, and he had to go there in person; some people were very panicked. He said that he was about to repay the loan, and he didn’t know when the stop payment measure would be lifted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/f282d2ba16.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;1707&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/f282d2ba16.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251129&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; posted online by Lin Qingqing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Post-disaster reconstruction&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang describes his life after being cheated It is &quot;post-disaster reconstruction&quot;. He had been attending school all these years and what little savings he had was wiped out in this fraud. &quot;After being deceived, I would even hesitate to eat beef noodles for 15 yuan.&quot; Chen Qiang said, and what is even more suffocating is that such days are expected to continue for more than a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, he reflected on his greed and arrogance, and felt ridiculous about his performance when he first entered the police station, &quot;(his) attitude was very bad.&quot; After he came to his senses, he called the police who took the notes at the time and asked if there was any possibility of recovery. The other party told him that it was difficult to recover overseas fraud, not to mention that it had been too long since the transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Chen Qiang hopes that &quot;post-disaster reconstruction&quot; will go smoothly. Seven days after he stopped transferring money and got out of the scam completely, he received a call from the public security bureau in his hometown, informing him that all bank card payments would be suspended for one month. &quot;After finally being defrauded, I looked away, but my card was blocked.&quot; Chen Qiang said he didn&#39;t know how long the payment stop would last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xueni also mentioned the anxiety after her bank card was stopped. She called the police and the bank where she opened her account many times to ask when the payment stop would be lifted, but the other party only said &quot;wait a little longer.&quot; Before the accident, she had borrowed a micro loan, and after the payment stopped, she could only borrow money to repay. Before she knew the exact time to unfreeze, she was very worried about not being able to repay the money she borrowed from friends. Wang Xueni did not tell her family that she had been cheated, and she had no money to use after the payment was stopped, so it was easy for her to reveal her secret. Because of this, she couldn&#39;t eat or sleep well. &quot;A protective stop payment is actually a punishment for the person who was defrauded. Let yourself remember this lesson.&quot; Wang Xueni said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng does not agree with the term &quot;lesson&quot;. She believes that she is a victim and being deceived is already a huge lesson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, there are many posts seeking relief from payment stoppages. Zhu Jingxian from Zhejiang was defrauded of 630,000 yuan due to her husband&#39;s negligence. After reporting the crime, her bank card was frozen for 48 hours. However, 25 days after the incident, the bank card was still protected from payment, and at the same time, various street police stations were called to inquire about the situation of being defrauded. After 35 days, his bank card was still unresolved. After explaining the situation to the Public Security Bureau, he had to wait another 48 hours for a reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng understands the netizen who posted the message. She believes that the specific situation should be analyzed in detail. Victims who have awakened can lift the payment stop early, rather than applying a blanket approach. On September 13, police from the China Merchants Police Station unfrozen all the credit cards in Li Zheng&#39;s name and temporarily unfrozen a savings card so that she could repay the company loan first. Li Zheng said that on September 14, the person in charge of the Futian Police Station informed him that the police station had internal discussions on the case and believed that there was a problem of insufficient exchange of information within the police, and that the police should be considerate of citizens&#39; demands and help solve the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Except for Guo Zhihao, all names in the text are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大科学装置“夸父”首次亮相]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256934]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The sun is the source of life&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sun is a symbol of light&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, humans want to create a &quot;sun&quot; on the earth&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let energy be inexhaustible, water clear and sky blue, and life sustainable&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xinhua News Agency reporter&#39;s exclusive visit&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;China’s large scientific installation &quot;CRAFT&quot; under construction&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look at this research platform&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to develop an &quot;engine&quot; for the future &quot;artificial sun&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/a963d796ae46fc31456463f2c9833a29.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot; 634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/a963d796ae46fc31456463f2c9833a29.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251117&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rendering of the &quot;Kuafu&quot; park (Photo courtesy of the Institute of Plasma Physics, Hefei Institute of Physical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scientific name of &quot;Kuafu&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fusion Reactor Host Key System Comprehensive Research Facility (CRAFT)&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is a major national science and technology infrastructure project established during the &quot;13th Five-Year Plan&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;December 2018 Approved to start construction in May&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is expected to be fully completed by the end of 2025&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18 /72f3a1a844b0a5a10a625b33b41fcbe0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;562&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/72f3a1a844b0a5a10a625b33b41fcbe0.png&quot; data -key=&quot;251114&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The actual construction scene of the &quot;Kuafu&quot; park taken on September 11.

The story of &quot;Apocalypse of Pretending&quot; takes place in Beijing CBD. Investment banking elite Xu Ziquan and lawyer Tang Ying meet.

They come from the poetic drama &quot;Faust&quot; created by the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the book, Faust is getting old, studying in a dark study for half his life, and feels extremely tired. At this time, the demon Mephisto comes and lures him to sign an agreement: to satisfy everything he had during his lifetime. Asked to take his soul until his death. This is also a bet between Mephisto and God. In pursuit of truth, Faust went through many hardships and traveled all the paths that humans have pursued. He often failed and sank, but he did not give up and finally gained redemption. Li Mo likes this work very much and has read it many times. He feels that Faust and Mephisto are the two sides of human beings. &quot;As people grow up, the soul seems to be less and less important. I wrote that sentence in my signature, hoping that all the people I know will think of this when they see it: If it is not so important, it will be in you. If you don’t even explore it, how about selling your soul? After Faust experienced everything, he found that the soul is the most important. This is the meaning of Mephisto.

There are many similar details in the play. Did you change these? Why do we need to change this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The model in the original book has been discontinued. A lot of the modifications were made in the hope that it would become closer to the present. I predict that people will be sensitive to these things. For example, the Le Labo balm that Xu Ziquan used on the plane at the beginning of the play was not mentioned in the original work. That is one of my personal favorites. I find it very convenient and can take it with me on the plane at any time. Later I learned that that one had also been discontinued, but it was still in production when I was writing the script. I want to change the TV series to be closer to some of my life (actual situations), and the wine used in it is also the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How the props are presented is part of the expression.

Because the play is over, I hope to give the audience a sense of closure, a ceremonial explanation. He proposed, not got married. I don&#39;t think they got married. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a big difference between proposing and getting married. Proposing means my determination and intention. I want to be with you forever. I didn’t say we’d grow old together, but I wanted to build our own world with you. I know that we may encounter many difficulties after entering marriage, but I believe that you and I have the ability to live our lives the way we want. This is the determination I want to say. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Idealism and materialism are not contradictory. I thought so in my heart. I want to take some actions to prove it. When I have the financial resources, I will buy a diamond ring to express my love to my lover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I put such a scene in the ending just to tell the audience that Xu Ziquan is a sincere person. Many viewers thought he was handsome, his butt was perky, he owned a car and a house, and he was a financial man... so they concluded that this (proposal) was not true, that this love was a fairy tale, and that he could not like a third-year lawyer so much. ——It looks like that. But love is not a business. There is no reason to fall in love with someone. I just love you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time of the final proposal, Xu Ziquan&#39;s view of love had changed. He was willing to build &quot;our world&quot; with Tang Ying, and was willing to turn one person&#39;s life into &quot;our two lives.&quot; , I think this is the value and meaning of marriage proposal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am willing to advocate the positive expression of I love you and my willingness in my plays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is this also your view on love? This positive expression and belief? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I keep exploring what love is before I can believe in it. I believe love begins when I meet my wife. A large part of Xu Ziquan is my projection. He didn&#39;t think there was such a person in the world who could support me, who could see the worst in me and still love me, who could tolerate me and understand me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tang Ying is the one who talks about love and understands love. Xu Ziquan understands teasing and skills. He knows how to make people like him. I like the scene in the bathroom the most. When Xu Ziquan was very bad, Tang Ying did not criticize him for being bad, but told him: You should tell me that you are not in a good state, you should share with me, and you should tell him that you are not in good condition. Show me your good side, don&#39;t worry, I can catch it, I think you are the best, you don&#39;t even know how good you are. This is a moment that I have experienced in my life, which makes me feel that I am loved, wrapped and supported by others. She made me feel that even though I was in such a bad state, I had such mood swings, my career was at a low point, and I couldn&#39;t see the future, she still didn&#39;t despise me, didn&#39;t measure me based on these, and didn&#39;t condemn me. She told me: I love you, you don’t even know how good you are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That moment made me understand what love is. It turns out that love is not about asking or giving, but about giving to each other. It means being able to see the worst side of him and still love him. This is the concept of love I want to tell you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/RUmrzlT0NgeYRX9rp0B9x0P0HAmubDRtmCGSdJwj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/RUmrzlT0NgeYRX9rp0B9x0P0HAmubDRtmCGSdJwj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills of &quot;The Pretender Apocalypse&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;No results will come if you don’t work hard None&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said you like Han Dongjun (playing Xu Zi Quan), why does this feeling of fatigue touch you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the people in the circle I want to talk about are not worthy of saying they are tired or saying they have worked hard. They earn more money. In the context of the play, it is unacceptable for people who earn more money to suffer miserably. But when he truly comes into contact with the lives of these people and their difficulties, he cannot tell others that he is tired, miserable, or unhappy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You work in CBD, you are so busy, you were admitted to Peking University and Tsinghua University, you graduated from the fourth department of the fifth college, you went to the red circle institute, you went to SDIC, you did it Middle level, this life is already at its peak, what else do you want? What else are you miserable about? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The worst thing about them is that they are not qualified to say they are miserable. There are seniors and juniors above them, and there are competitors beside them. If they make a mistake, they will be overthrown by others. No one can see the current situation of their lives. People think you deserve it, you deserve it. Why do you scream miserably? I can&#39;t even eat, I don&#39;t even scream miserably. You live in fine clothes and food every day, and go to luxurious occasions. Why are you so miserable? So I can&#39;t scream for them in this scene. I can only show their state. This is the feeling of fatigue. He can&#39;t express it. He can only smile and say to people, yes, you are right. This is how I feel about the people I know. Of course I don&#39;t think they are miserable either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I want to talk about this group of people, I have to capture the most unique part of this group of people. For me, this part is that these people are very tired, but they can’t express it. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You filmed &quot;I&#39;m Good in a Foreign Country&quot; and &quot;Three &quot;Joy Has a New Life&quot; and &quot;Pretending to Be Apocalypse&quot; have received good reviews.

I clearly know that this thing can be done well, and I know how to do it well, but I just can&#39;t do it. At times like this, I feel very small in this city. I don’t know what the problem is, I’ve done everything I can, but things are still like this. This is the plight of urbanites that resonates most with me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I want to tell you more, don’t give up in the face of this dilemma. Giving up is a kind of self-protection, because if you don’t have expectations, you won’t be disappointed or hurt. Whether facing work, love or family relationships, they all protect themselves in a way of withdrawal. It&#39;s fine if I&#39;m alone, it&#39;s fine if I don&#39;t go up, it&#39;s fine if I lie down, and I still get paid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even so, we should try. How terrible is failure? How terrible is falling out of love? Sometimes I feel that falling out of love is a very happy thing. I can feel many emotions that I can&#39;t usually feel. What a valuable life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You see, everything I talked about is quite idealistic. The material aspect is also important, but in fact you can live no matter what, and you don’t have to make a lot of money. The main thing is to figure out the standard of living you want, and if you do well in what you do today, it will be great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you feel like you have gotten out of this predicament now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s hard to get out. I still feel powerless. Even if I feel I have done more than before, I still have things to do. Less than. The longer I work, the more powerless I feel. There are very few things that people can control. The director seems to have quite a lot of power and can decide many things, but I can&#39;t decide whether it will rain today or whether there will be a meeting tomorrow. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you feel powerless, it means you have not found the right way to get along with the world. Once you find it, you can feel the support the world gives you, rather than you and the world. opposition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When did you begin to feel that the world was giving you help and support?

The reality is that our efforts may not necessarily bring positive returns, and individuals cannot achieve a change in their destiny just by working hard. Have you ever thought about this reality in your expression? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I plan to talk to you about this in a later project. It is about a young man born in the 2000s who has been very ambitious since he was a child. , was admitted to a very good university in Beijing, and enrolled in 2019. After three years of the COVID-19 epidemic, I couldn’t find a job after graduation. I am currently writing a script and will film this project next year. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think now is an era of change, which is different from before. Everyone must accept the change. Every generation will face changes in the times, such as social fluctuations, wars, and changes, so there is no need to panic. You said that in the face of structural problems, people need to adjust their goals and self-positioning in the face of this era. It does not mean that the times have changed and I will not get the same results as in the previous era if I work hard, so I don&#39;t work hard. Efforts in this era will have results in this era. Without efforts, there will be no results. Working hard is not a choice, working hard is what you should do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe when I finish filming the scene next year, I can bring some discussion to everyone. I want to tell everyone how to be down-to-earth in that scene. But I still want to tell you here, don’t give up. When you are lying down in this era, a group of people who are not lying down will take away the opportunity. This is the case in every era. The opportunities you give up will be taken away by others. If you work hard, you may find opportunities.

It is simply &quot;measured&quot; by a group of men who have experienced the cruel beatings of society but can always stand up in the world. &quot;Customized&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A foreign talk show actor said in an interview that eating pizza and drinking wine, sitting in front of the TV watching football games, scolding the referee, just spending a happy time alone, never mind What a blessing. When asked if he was tired from watching so many football games in a week, he replied: &quot;Not tired at all, because I am the kind of simple-minded man who can get happiness just by sitting and watching football games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;So, &quot;Will you watch football games with your wife?&quot; His answer was: &quot;No, she has a complicated mind and it is difficult to focus on one thing. Some women feel unhappy every day because of this.&quot; A bit. He complained about his wife. However, one fact is good: differences in preferences between men and women exist objectively, and many times, this difference is also interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A male respondent on Zhihu said that there were a bunch of things in his online shopping list that he wanted to buy but knew were useless, and a wooden stick costing more than ten yuan came second. After getting the stick, he put glue on his hands and brought it to the unit. The female colleague asked him why he bought it. He said he just wanted to buy it, but she didn&#39;t understand. This seems to mean that a dozen yuan is money, and it is not a waste to buy a handful of green onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asserted: &quot;I&#39;ll just put the stick here. Do you think any man will come over and not play with it?&quot; As a result, six or seven people played with the stick in the afternoon. She couldn&#39;t understand it, so he gave it to her. Her husband sent a photo, and after a while her husband replied: This stick is great! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The respondent lamented that this stick can kill boys from a few years old to several decades old, but as long as a boy sees something he played with when he was a child, he will immediately and seamlessly pick it up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also have personal experience of this. I played seal carving when I was thirteen and learned a lot. Although I slacked off a bit when I reached middle age, my hobby of sharpening stones remained. As long as you see the carving knife and the seal stone, you will feel warm in your heart. If you pick up the stone and sharpen it, you will experience the non-utilitarian joy. Not long ago, my parents-in-law listened to my suggestion and built a &quot;grindstone&quot; for me in a chicken coop in the countryside. I often put away my mundane things and concentrate on grinding stones here. While grinding the stone, the chickens are walking and the insects are chirping, and the wind is blowing and the leaves are falling, so I feel at ease. At that moment, this ultimate tranquility with nothing to worry about and no rush for five buckets of rice was charming and magical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final analysis, the reason why many men can remain teenagers until they die is that they have always experienced the essence of simple happiness. Not to mention that things worth more than ten yuan can make them happy. Even worthless things, such as a branch or a stone picked up from the Gobi Desert, can make them immersed in it and play with it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the real happiness does not cost money. A good friend who graduated from Peking University told me that he likes physics and mathematics and is very happy every time he looks at it online. One of my old leaders also likes to sit for a while at work after work late at night and play against Go masters on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have noticed the chess players and chess watchers in a small street called Hongmiao near my work. Unless it rains heavily, they all play and watch chess on old tables on the street. As the chess game changes, , sometimes they are nervous and &quot;dare not speak loudly&quot;, sometimes they are cheerful and cheerful. I have been here for more than ten years, so I have carefully noticed that there are always only a few people playing chess and watching chess. Over the years, apart from their older faces, their happy expressions have not changed at all. Is that chess game about money? About reputation? About status? Not really. They are just &quot;stealing half a day&#39;s leisure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writer Wang Zengqi also wrote a story about an old man who was selfless and wonderful at making noodles and fish, praising him as a &quot;living Zhuangzi&quot;.所谓的“活庄子”，要义不在“高深”，而在意象悠远、无拘无束吧。那些在寂静无人的河道边一坐就是一天的“钓友”，也是如此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;绝大多数男人当然不可能绝然世外，名利之累也是有的。但是步入中老年岁月后，很多男人顿悟，既然工作与职级也就那样了，一辈子能到的高度也就那样了，得不到的就放手好了，留下一片素净天地让自己过得更简单、更纯真，岂非更好？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种考虑，是一种质朴品性的折射。当一个男人把个人荣辱、人生得失想透彻了之后，剩下的事就简单许多了。于是，从与自己的相处中得到乐趣，就成为一件每天要完成的课目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与自己相处，某种意义上是难度最大的。如果一个人总是心怀不切实际的目标，总是和自己较劲；那么，这种自处的质量就会很糟糕，人格还容易撕裂。当然，如果一个人出于攀比心，总是（对配偶）心怀不切实际的目标，使劲催逼自己的配偶“努力”，去挣更多的钱、要有权，那么这种相处的质量就会很糟糕，家庭也很难和睦。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反过来，如果一个人能意识到人生的某个阶段并不是追求到什么才是快乐，能保持一份平常心，就很容易让自己的“影子”也被自己营造的天趣所感染，从而真正融合在一起，让自己变得更强大，更从容。如果家人比较理解或也是这样的人，家庭就会比较融洽和睦。这种自在、放松、忘我、乐在其中，与消费主义助推的、极易带来痛苦的攀比，很不一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人不免受到欲望袭扰，但人还是要努力做到与自己的相处达到平衡之境。童心未泯，是一个很平易却是至高的境界。它的基础是刚健的秉性、快乐的真谛。说到底，很多男人对于“简单快乐”的尊崇，代表了一个群体对于自身价值的客观评价和对“世外”的不卑不亢之态度，它延续着个体的童心，也让世俗生活多了几分恬淡的意趣。这就是“至死是少年”所暗藏的男人的秘密。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;法国巴黎圣拉扎尔地铁区域快铁（RER）站。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在乡下度日，没有什么着急上火的时候，无非是下暴雨了赶出去收衣裳，或者把进水的窗户关起来。但进城就不一样了，尤其是在巴黎有很多焦急的时刻，比如赶车赶飞机。那种时刻，我一般会开启“刺客模式”，不断告诫自己：集中注意力，直奔目标，才能不耽搁事儿。比如有一天早上，我约了一个从国内来逛美术馆的朋友，一起在她的宾馆吃早点。我出门发现已经有些晚了，要坐72路去卢浮宫，眼看着72路从我眼前开过，距离下一站还有五百米的样子。趁着车子等红绿灯，我一口气向前跑去，想在车子到下一站之前赶上。我跑了大约一百米的样子，公车师傅赶上我，摁了喇叭让我上车。上去之后，满车的人都用同情的眼光看着我。他们一定在想，这女人真是有点儿拼。我一时有些茫然，向师傅道谢，又手忙脚乱地刷卡。其实我没想到更拼的还在后面，就是这次坐飞机回国的时刻，体会到什么叫分秒必争。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我先是打算坐车去的，一切都安排得井井有条。我的朋友迈克是一个漂在巴黎的意大利小资产阶级（黎漂，热衷于去超市购物、攒积分，发现各种省钱攻略）。他一直都没有送我去过机场，因为他之前开着一辆污染等级5级的柴油车，除了周末的有些时候，基本不能开出去。现在他有了一辆污染等级2级的新车子，可以随时上路了，就热情地说要送我。而且时间也是巧，他五点下班，我们五点二十出发。我的飞机是九点二十的，提前四个小时出门，戴高乐机场距离我住的地方也不过三十公里，一个小时应该也到了。我盘算了一下，觉得很合适。我五点时去附近的店铺里买了一碗鱼片盖饭，上面铺了一层金枪鱼和三文鱼，没有汤汤水水，可以在登机前享用，就不用在飞机上吃东西。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们是在差不多五点半时出发的，气氛轻松，听着音乐，又说又笑。开始的几公里还算畅快，一上环线，路上基本是停车场状况，只有摩托车在汽车中间的空隙飞驰，救护车和警车一辆辆过去，两边的车会让开。我看着窗外，心想大城市有什么好，简直太纷乱了。但时间真的很充分，我尽量放松，车子的收音机放着爵士女歌手比莉·哈乐黛（Bilie&amp;nbsp;Holiday）舒缓、忧伤、悠扬的歌声，像一种灵魂的按摩，讲的是一个女人为爱疯狂，可以为爱挪开大山什么的。迈克说，你如果是住在桥底下的流浪者就好了，不用赶回去上班。我也想那样啊，可是我喜欢柔软的床铺，我爱我的工作，我要赶回去上班。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们在环线上活活堵了一个小时，打算下去了，但一下辅路，车子更是死死停在那里，不能向前，不能倒退。在地图上，整个城市的路线都发红了，又原地等到了差不多七点钟。我在窗口看了看，前后左右都是车，越来越心慌，已经开始想象因为赶不上上课被学校开除的悲惨处境，就连轻快的爵士小调都无法让我的心境平缓下来，窗外的城市好像越来越咄咄逼人，蓝天白云也显得很空洞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迈克一筹莫展，只有从钱包里拿出一张车票跟我说：“你从这里下去，往前走是4号线，你从那里坐车到北站，再坐快线RER、B线到戴高乐，需要一个小时赶到机场。这个区域很乱，小心钱包和手机。你准备好了吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我没有准备好，但是我硬着头皮下了车，如果中间有任何差错，一个小时赶不到，我就误机了。但如果我坐在车上干等，误机更是必然。我从后备箱里拿了行李（我庆幸自己是四轮行李），在自行车道上飞奔起来，像一只在草原上遭到狮子追击的羚羊。我一边跑一边开启了“刺客模式”，目标是在一个小时之内赶到机场。我庆幸自己穿了板鞋，还有退休运动员般良好的体力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开始还算顺利，我站在地铁站里，犹豫从哪儿下去，一老太太大声说：“两边都一样。”一下到地下，就有地铁开着门等着。上去之前，我还和一个文质彬彬的男人确认了是不是去北站。我很警惕地看着站牌，担心错过了。但坐到北站，事情变得复杂起来了，里面有很多火车、RER线路和地铁线，我一下找不到B线，按照指示牌却走错了地方，还好上车前问了一下，没有上错车。我像无头苍蝇一样乱走，看见一个正在打电话的执勤人员，飞奔过去，问他去戴高乐机场去哪里坐，估计是我满头大汗震撼到他了。他一边讲电话，一边快速把我领到了坐车的地方，巧的是，这时我要坐的车子也到了，赶上飞机的可能多了一筹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后是焦心的四十分钟，每一站都似乎无比漫长，每一站都有人不紧不慢地上下车。我想，这时只有山洪、地震、恐怖袭击、地铁故障才能阻碍我去机场。我很心焦，不停地看手机，看着坐在旁边两个神情自若的女人，她们也带着巨大的行李，只是她们一定有更多的时间。我感叹自己昨天下午还在河边的躺椅上，吃着生火腿和奶酪，喝着啤酒，今天就要经历这样的考验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;终于到了戴高乐机场，距离关闭办登机牌还有二十分钟。我跟着人流飞奔到柜台前，一个英俊的黑人小哥张开手来，对我说：“别着急，来得及的。放松点儿。”我把护照递给他，心想我看起来一定很狼狈，真是如匪过境。旁边的旅客也在抱怨今天的大堵车，似乎替我的晚到解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;寄了行李，在安检那里排队，发语音给意大利朋友说今天的遭遇。前面的姑娘居然是意大利人，就对我说：“您排我前面吧。如果是我，也焦虑死了。”真是四海之内皆姐妹。她说她在巴黎欧莱雅做了三年，现在去上海待三年，她的飞机在我的后面。我对她道谢，就毫不客气地排到了她前面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了登机口那里，我发现自己身上的汗变得冰冷，T恤完全是湿透的，印在上面的黄色鱼图案变成了褐色，顿时感觉很忧虑。我看到旁边有一家零售店，就花了二十欧重金买了一件旅游纪念T恤，去洗手间里换上，又擦干了头发，做到万无一失。这时候，登机口已经不用怎么排队了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我在排队登机了。”我给迈克打电话，让他放心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我也刚回家。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“今天多亏了你的机场轻轨票，谢谢。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“不客气，很抱歉没把你送到。我在吃你忘在座椅上的鱼片盖饭，还不错。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“祝你胃口好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“祝你一路顺风。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后我穿着一件胸口印着硕大的艾菲尔铁塔、略显俗气的T恤从重庆机场走了出来，像一个去外面刚打了卡的游客。我得说，这次赶上飞机的事，让我在庆幸之余增添了很多面对未来的信心。我想起了一句经文：凡事都有定期，天下万物都有定时……寻找有时，失落有时；保守有时，舍弃有时；撕裂有时，缝补有时；静默有时，言语有时……我觉得，一切都有定数，误机有时，赶上趟也有时：必要的时候开启“刺客模式”，保持警惕&lt;strong>;，&lt;/strong>;勇往直前，总有一线赶上的生机。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;三峡两岸风光旖旎，在游轮上朝观旭日东升，晚赏朗月疏星，拢一袖清风，看一江水向东流去，实为寄情山水的好去处。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;武隆的天坑地缝更是令人叫绝，那个天坑真的好像老天爷一失手砸下了一块巨石，在地上砸出了一个巨坑，雄、奇、险、幽；那地缝就像大地深处裂开了一道窄缝，两旁岩壁险峻，上边泉瀑飞溅，下面溪水长流，幽幻无穷，让人叹为观止。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，这两段旅行中的美好就仅止于此了，因为旅游还要吃饭，还要睡觉，还有导游，这些给人的感觉就不那么美好了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;先来说说导游。导游老早就实行了地陪制，一个地方换一个导游，到了景点，再换一个讲解员，一路游下来，好多的导游，一张脸还没记熟，马上又换另一张脸，走马灯似的。这对于脸盲的我来说，很不友好，这也罢了——不罢也无可奈何啊——三年不远行的我惊讶地发现，地陪制一以贯之，不过现在导游的画风又变了，纷纷变身为导买了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们游完三峡大坝，去往码头的路上，导游在车上开始推销牛肉、小鱼制品和芝麻食品，她说，这些产品质量有保障，价格也良心，她要给女儿赚兴趣班的钱。司机配合着开得很慢，后来干脆停在了路边，约三分之一的游客购买了她放在车里的这些产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三峡游中途，我们上了一条小船，游神女溪。小船上除了一名船夫，还有一个阿妹讲解员。神女溪很美，讲解员一开始介绍得还不错，可是，只“不错”了一会儿，她就介绍起了她的家乡，她家乡的各种特产，“纯天然，无污染，对人体有特殊疗效”。不出我所料，返程的时候，她就开始售卖预先放在游船里的家乡特产，整个回程途中，就听导游在耳麦里喊：“请支持一下我们家乡。”“你要几包？”看景的心情被破坏掉了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到重庆后，导游倒没有导买实物，她兜售的是夜游重庆项目，三个地方，70元。车到市区，她带着参加夜游的游客下车去了，让我们自己到酒店办理入住手续，然后游客们在酒店前台因为谁先谁后办理吵成一团。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;武隆游还带了一个苗寨景区，在这个景区里，印象最深的是景区讲解员不断地推销他们的银制品，在他的嘴里，这些银制品天上没有人间仅存，有很全方位的保健作用，吧啦吧啦一大堆。结果没人购买，他就不理我们了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再来说说吃的。两个旅游团，大部分含餐，除了游轮上的三餐还算正常，其他的一言难尽。餐标是每人40元，八菜一汤。这八菜，荤的有很肥的扣肉、洋葱炒鸡杂等，素的有凉皮、土豆、南瓜等，汤是名副其实的汤水，我在一个萝卜汤里只看见了三片萝卜……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;住的嘛，只保证每人有一张床睡，至于灯亮不亮，洗澡水温适不适宜，门锁有没有坏，游客们就自求多福了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出去旅游，不做攻略，不规划线路，不劳神费脑地考虑用车用餐入住酒店等问题，把这一切交给旅行社，自己做个甩手掌柜，我觉得这是很经济很便捷的模式。你旅行社赚到钱，我游客享受到了好山好水好心情，双方各得其所，多好！&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但我疑惑的是，旅游行业为什么要朝着相反的方向一路狂奔？你看，导游就差伸到你口袋里掏钱了，400元一桌的团餐恨不得压缩到40元，房间越便宜越好，管它什么设施齐不齐。难道他们不觉得在自寻绝路，把游客往外推？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三年疫情后，旅游的市场需求很大，如果旅游行业把握住这个风口，整顿行风，提供优质的服务，扭转形象，打造口碑，应该能把很多的游客吸引到他们的麾下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可惜啊，他们在坑游客的路上越走越远。我不知道这样的旅行团还能走多远，至少，我不敢再参团了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为浙江嘉兴退休教师）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p>;中国自行车协会副理事长兼秘书长郭文玉表示，基于对北京、长沙、成都等8个城市的出行数据调研显示，全国城镇居民每100次出行中，约有30次由“两轮出行”完成，全国发生在轨道站点周边的“两轮出行”占其出行总量20%以上。全国每日因“两轮出行”而减少碳排放约1万吨，按照百公里油耗8升计算，相当于节省约660万升汽油。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自行车行业不断推动产品结构优化。郭文玉表示，目前轻量化、智能化的电助力自行车产量增长明显。近两年以来，电助力自行车国内销量增长率超20%，具有智能功能的电助力自行车深受年轻消费者青睐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自行车行业数字化智能化持续推进。郭文玉说，目前在生产端，焊接机器人、涂装机器人、组装线送料机器人等应用范围更广，20%以上的行业企业已开展生产线自动化升级改造。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在自行车行业的消费端，依靠大数据、物联网等技术支持，涌现出共享单车、集中充换电等新产品新模式。哈啰集团副总裁褚轶群表示，作为共享出行的头部企业，哈啰的注册用户数和订单数在过去几年稳步攀升。 “用高水准的骑行产品与服务来不断普及低碳出行和健康生活，共享单车企业责无旁贷。”褚轶群说。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2021年3月2日，云南保山腾冲，一所乡村小学里，准备睡觉的学生。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年5月，还在华中科技大学读行政管理博士的雷望红，正在为博士论文寻找选题，她第一次把目光投向了基层教育。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个决定源于一次“震惊”。她从江汉平原的乡村学校里走出，一路求学念到博士，却在回乡时听说学校已不复当年模样，学生打架、升学率走低，初中班主任竟挨了学生的打，在教室后面擦眼泪。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，雷望红走访了江苏、浙江、湖南、甘肃、河南等地区的县域学校，她发现这种现象并非特例。她察觉到，基础教育的末端正在发生一些剧烈变化，而这些处于末端的变化，悄然无声。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教育城镇化浪潮下，农村学生涌入县城，而村镇中剩下的往往是无力负担进城就读成本的孩子，他们中的一些人不爱学习、不服管教，近乎自我放弃，老师也很头疼，双方都处于没有出路的迷茫之中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雷望红认为，对于县级政府而言，教育城镇化的主要目标是地区发展，即通过吸引农村学生进城就读带动农村人口进城买房和消费，以此促进土地财政的闭合循环，最终推动地区经济发展。但从实践看，教育进城并没有如预想的那么大幅拉动地方经济发展，却导致了一些学生被剩在乡镇中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她发现，中西部省份、东部省份的县域在推进教育城镇化过程中，发展路径也不尽相同：东部地区公私教育更为均衡，中西部地区的私立教育相对更强。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为何会存在这种地区差异？教育城镇化经历了至少十年发展，效能如何？这股浪潮之下，被剩下的孩子应该怎么办？雷望红如今已是中南大学公共管理学院讲师，围绕相关议题，她接受南方周末记者采访。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;经济基础决定县域教育发展路径&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你当时是如何关注到县域教育问题的？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;有一次回老家，邻居小孩告诉我，我的初中班主任被学生打了，在教室后面擦眼泪。我读书时，她很威严，我非常尊敬她，这样的反差让人很震惊，加上老家这些年升学情况不太好，社会上关于教育资源分配不均的讨论也很激烈。当时我们团队一直研究基层治理，还没有人研究基层的教育议题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;2017年5月之后，我先后到江苏、浙江、湖南、湖北、广东、广西和贵州等地，调研了村、乡、县不同空间里各种学段的教育情况，并了解政府教育事业的发展情况、学生家庭情况、学校社会评价，县域教育整体的研究视野逐渐出现。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;东部地区和中西部地区，在县域教育发展中各自面临哪些问题？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;东部地区教育资源充足，家长也有能力，一般会和学校形成较好的家校合作，但教育竞争非常激烈，比如之前新闻报道的杭州家委会竞选，为了给孩子争取更多的表现机会，家长之间会进行激烈PK。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中西部地区最主要的是代际分离问题，家长也会跟风采取一些自救行为，比如说“陪读”，甘肃、陕西、安徽、湖北的陪读现象都非常普遍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有发现不同地区教育情况有相似之处吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;有一个相似之处，就是教育城镇化。简单来讲，城里的学校质量提高，吸引学生进城就读，进而推动更多家庭进城买房，以此盘活土地财政和地区发展。但东部地区和中西部地区有些许的差异。前者的教育城镇化更多的是自然城镇化，家长因城市有工作机会，进城工作、居住和带着孩子进城接受教育；后者的教育城镇化则有地方政府推动的因素，因乡村学校教育供给太差，地方政府又将更多资源投到城区学校，因此迫使老百姓将孩子送到城区学校就读。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年我到浙江的一个发达县区调研，当地村小基本都撤了，集中到乡镇办学。乡镇学校设施完善、建得很漂亮，老师水平也很高，很多都是从外地考来的。但是因为教育城镇化，农村小孩进城读书，留下来的都是家庭条件较差的孩子，不爱学习、不太好管，老师们很头疼。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来我发现这种现象很普遍，东部地区的末端在乡镇，中西部地区的末端在村一级。处在这样的末端，没法给学生提供足够的教育希望，老师也很痛苦。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;东部和中西部地区教育城镇化的发展逻辑是一样的吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;东部地区和中西部地区由于经济基础不同，空间分配区别很大。东部地区经济发达，教育供给能力强，县域城乡各个空间的公共教育质量都能得到保证。东部地区产业发达，就业空间大，家长到城市就业，小孩也进城读书，家庭能在城市买房安居。它的城镇化是一种自然的、教育和生产同步的城镇化。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而大量中西部地区的县域还没有建立起能够让地方政府获得足够财力的地方财政，无法保证城乡教育均衡发展，提供给本地在外打工人员返乡的就业空间也很少。农民家庭中的年轻人只能去东部城市务工挣钱，因为无法负担发达地区高昂的教育成本，孩子只能留在老家上学，由父辈照顾。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年5月，雷望红和团队在某县调研。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;公立教育需要回应社会需求&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;至少十年前开始，有很多观点认为教育城镇化是一个“绿色引擎”，你对于教育城镇化研究的切入点又是什么？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;当时主要受到两重刺激。一是学界不少人把教育城镇化当作积极正面的行为，但在实际调研过程中，我发现教育城镇化存在很多问题，大家的教育焦虑非常严重，许多家庭承受了过重的教育负担，教育和医疗、住房一起成为了新“三座大山”。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一重是看了复旦大学熊易寒教授的博士论文《城市化的孩子》后，我深受启发。我们关注的现象很相似——农村孩子进入城市后能和城市的孩子共享一片教育蓝天吗？实际上农村小孩进城之后，容易被边缘化。比如城里的老师会提及对农村孩子有不讲卫生、不守规矩等刻板印象表述，城市学校的校园文化在一定程度上会使得农村孩子感到自卑；农村孩子也很少能进入到班级权力结构之中，因为老师更容易接受城市文化熏陶的孩子并与之形成有效沟通和互动。我和城乡学生座谈时也发现，城区学生的表达能力更强、善于展示自己，农村学生内向，要发言的时候，会不经意地看一下城里的学生，害怕说错。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;促进教育城镇化，地方政府要在县城新建学校，开设公立和私立学校之间，大部分县区更愿意选择哪种方式？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;政府更愿意建设公立学校。因为私立学校管理存在困难，它能够自主收费，灵活利用招生政策，通过利益吸引对优质生源进行“掐尖”，等到中高考出成绩后，这批学生成为学校宣传的“活招牌”，生源、师资会进一步朝私立学校聚集，导致地方公立学校处于弱势地位，一定程度上影响到地方教育生态。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;但实际上中西部地区还是会选择引入私立学校，为什么？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;因为一些中西部地区的县域地方财政不足以支撑公立教育发展。地方政府一方面有招商引资的任务指标，另一方面又要保证教育供给，处在多重压力之下。一些地区的私立学校是通过招商引资引入，地方政府既完成了相应的招商指标，也能缓解当地的学位供给压力。同时私立学校培养的优异生，也能算作地方政府的教育政绩。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;家长又是为什么青睐私立学校？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;主要原因是很多公立学校没有回应家长的教育诉求。今年我到中部省份的一所乡镇初中调研，发现学生食堂没有配备桌椅，学生蹲在楼梯口吃饭。还有学校安排学生住在二三十年前的房子里，宿舍的墙皮不时会脱落。2021年我在调研时遇到一个司机，他说两个小孩都在私立学校读书，一年要花6万块，夫妻二人的工资只够小孩的开销，生活压力很大。我问他如果公立学校能够提供相对较好的食宿服务，但每学期需要多交一千块钱，愿不愿意去？他说肯定愿意。这也是大多数家长的心声，只有政府想办法真正回应老百姓的诉求，学生才会慢慢从私立学校里回流。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;经过研究，你发现教育城镇化可能带来哪些问题？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;一是负债风险，一些地方政府以教育为抓手，推进教育兴城，短时间内投入大量资金新建学校，导致负债严重。最近我听说一个中部省份县城，正在花巨资建一所学校，调研中很多县城都有巨额负债。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二是学校的维护成本很高，一些地方政府超前按照最高标准建设学校，大量空间闲置，导致学校运营成本非常高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三是农民教育负担重。一些地方在建设中小学时，只看重单纯的教育问题，不考虑整体社会分工情况，一些城区新建学校没有配备宿舍、食堂，农村家长将孩子送进城了仍然需要在城里租房或买房陪读，不能照顾孩子的家长就将孩子交给托管机构，比如现在广西的托管机构特别发达，托管机构不仅管学生的生活，还管课后学习。无论是租房或买房陪读，还是托管，都大大增加了农民的教育经济负担。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四是刚刚提到的农村学生适应问题，城区学校内实质上形成了新的城乡教育二元结构，农村学生的家庭出身和家庭知识能力，不一定能支持他们在城市里接受公平的教育。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;既然有这么多问题，为什么中西部省份的基层还是在推进教育城镇化？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;把学生集中到县城，除了方便管理以外，县域政府还试图通过教育城镇化来激活当地土地财政。通过大力发展县城教育，让农民进城买房。地方政府能够促进资金回流、人口聚集，形成链条，让县域经济活跃起来。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这些努力有效果吗？看到你博士论文调查走访的3个中西部县城，最终房价都没有涨上去，这是为什么？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;实际上农民进城买房的积极性并不高，甘肃一个县城2014年房价是4000元/平方米，但2017年我到该县调研时，房价却还在4000元左右徘徊，即使如此，房子还是卖不出去。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;县域教育的发展关键在于县域经济。农民进城购房积极性不高的根本原因在于，城里缺乏足以支撑他们维持家庭生活的工业基础，农民工在县城如果只能做建筑工、服务员等工作，收入水平不足以支持他们在县城买房定居。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;教育城镇化是一条值得肯定的地方发展路径吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;雷望红：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;教育城镇化是一个必然趋势，只是存在快慢之分。我们批判的是以教育作为抓手，大搞教育兴城的现象。教育城镇化要以合理的速度推进，一方面要尊重自然流动规律，老百姓有能力进城、想进城，要尊重他们的选择；与此同时，也要看到人为因素推动教育城镇化所带来的负债、维护成本高、学生适应难等问题。在目前的阶段更合适的方式是建设好乡镇学校，给没有能力进城的学生一定的教育发展空间，要让在这个空间里读书的孩子有希望考上高中、大学，这样整个社会阶层的流动才能保持畅通，才有希望。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;
