(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Enrolled into university at the age of 26 and graduated with a doctorate at the age of 38. This year, Bian Jianlin turns 70. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At two o&#39;clock in the afternoon on October 18, 2023, Bian Jianlin appeared at the door of the office of China University of Political Science and Law on time. He was tall and thin, wearing a fitted black casual suit and a trousers. He was wearing trousers and holding a red paper bag in his hand, which contained three volumes of &quot;Governing the Country by Law and Criminal Procedure - Collected Works of Bian Jianlin&#39;s Legal Studies&quot;. For his 70th birthday this month, the publisher specially planned this collection of essays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1979, eight years after graduating from high school, Bian Jianlin left his hometown in Jiangsu and entered Beijing Political Science and Law School, which had just resumed school after the Cultural Revolution. College, which is now China University of Political Science and Law. Relying on employee scholarships provided by the state, Bian Jianlin completed his bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees. Just before life was about to reach another fork in the road, &quot;a major event happened.&quot; In 1986, the third batch of law doctoral programs in the country was confirmed, and two law professors from China University of Political Science and Law were appointed as doctoral supervisors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1987, Bian Jianlin studied under Professor Chen Guangzhong, who is recognized as the &quot;founder of criminal procedure law&quot; in China. Four years later, he became the first doctoral student in criminal procedural law independently trained by the People&#39;s Republic of China, and embarked on a career development path similar to that of his mentor. To date, Bian Jianlin has trained 87 doctors and 11 postdoctoral fellows. He also serves as the honorary dean of the Procedural Law Institute of China University of Political Science and Law, the executive director and academic committee member of the China Law Society, and the honorary president of the China Criminal Procedural Law Research Association. He works as a professor at Jilin University, Wuhan University, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, East China University of Political Science and Law, Northwest University of Political Science and Law, People&#39;s Public Security University of China, and National Prosecutor&#39;s College. On social media, he always actively participates in various seminars and academic lectures to share his understanding and suggestions on the construction of the criminal procedure system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unwilling to flaunt himself, Bian Jianlin almost never talks about his past experiences in public. Even in this two-hour interview, the topic never got around to his mentor. And he himself seemed to be just an ordinary student who was &quot;older and started school late&quot;, and he was lucky enough to get to where he is now by accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Accidentally became the &quot;first&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong >;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the preface of the anthology, it seems that this is the first time you mentioned your experiences as a student. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t like to talk about my resume. This collection of essays has a profound impact on my academic work. It means life summary, so I said a few words in the preface. I was admitted early at the University of Political Science and Law, and was in the first class after the school was re-established. However, compared with other scholars who entered earlier, I was still relatively older when I entered. Fortunately, I completed my bachelor&#39;s degree, master&#39;s degree and Ph.D. in one go, so I gained some time back. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; What were you doing before you were admitted to the Beijing University of Political Science and Law in 1979? How did you think of studying law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduating from high school in 1971, I went to work in a provincial factory. Later, the college entrance examination was resumed, but after all, it was not a required option. Very few of my high school classmates went on to college. At that time, everyone had a job and even got married and had children. But I still have a little bit of ambition, and I have such an ambition to take the exam. As for studying law, it is almost an inevitable choice. First of all, during the ten years of turmoil, our generation was wasted. Basically, we did not learn mathematics, physics and chemistry, and we were seriously partial to subjects. It was not easy to take the science and engineering exams, so we had to choose from liberal arts. Foreign languages, Chinese, history and law, among which law is definitely the most attractive. The main reason is that many of the books I read in the past were about solving crimes, about identifying doubts and clearing grievances, punishing evil and eradicating evil, and upholding justice, so I naturally developed a legal feeling. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Why study Criminal Procedure Law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was an undergraduate, the school had only one law major, and there was no further subdivision. major. When I was about to graduate, I decided to take the postgraduate entrance examination. According to my personality and interests, I didn’t really like civil law. What I liked most was the “study of criminal justice”, so my major choice should be criminal law. However, there is a certain degree of chance in choosing criminal procedure law. The school&#39;s master&#39;s entrance exams for Criminal Procedure Law and Criminal Law only differed in one subject, Criminal Procedure Archeology Chinese, while Criminal Law was the history of the legal system. In the year of the postgraduate entrance examination, I went home to celebrate the Spring Festival. After the Spring Festival, I had to take the exam. I thought that I would have to work hard to prepare for the legal history course, and there is always some basic knowledge in ancient Chinese, so it was just a matter of thought. The choice of exam subjects suddenly determined the direction of my major, so it was not that I realized the procedure from that time on. value and importance, because in fact substantive law was still ranked ahead of procedural law at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Law is a practical subject. During your studies, didn’t you ever think about getting into practice? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;To learn the law, you must use it. Logically speaking, you have to work in the practical department , plus I was relatively old when I entered school. At that time, a bachelor&#39;s degree was enough, and I also studied for a master&#39;s degree. So I faced two choices at the time. One was to follow my family&#39;s wishes and return to Jiangsu. The Provincial High School wanted to recruit a Mature judges are more interested in me; if they stay in Beijing, they want to go to the Interpol China National Central Bureau through an old leader of the Ministry of Public Security. I did have some thoughts, but in the end both options were given up, and they were not implemented to the extent of signing a contract. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Why gave up? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1986, before I graduated with my master’s degree, the school was approved for two doctoral programs, including Two teachers were identified as doctoral supervisors, namely Professor Wang Xuan and Professor Chen Guangzhong. Teacher Chen is responsible for the litigation law major. They are also the first batch of doctoral supervisors at China University of Political Science and Law. After receiving the PhD approval, Teacher Chen once talked to me. First, he told me that I had the opportunity to continue my studies; second, he expressed his affirmation to me. After Teacher Chen chatted with me, I was more tempted, although I didn’t fully appreciate the school’s advantages at the time. The most important thing is that my nature is that I am always uneasy about the status quo and have an upward spirit. I have never thought of being rich and settling down. In this way, I decided to continue studying for a Ph.D. after graduating with a master’s degree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; You obtained your master&#39;s degree in 1986 and your doctoral program was approved in the same year. How come it was only a year later that you started studying for your Ph.D.? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I started preparing for the Ph.D. exam before and after I graduated with my master’s degree. However, although the doctoral program was approved at that time, there were insufficient preparations for public announcements and enrollment listings. Due to various reasons, neither doctoral program enrolled students that year. However, Teacher Chen happened to be the deputy dean of the Graduate School at the time, and the school established a new research institution, the Chinese Legal Research Institute, with Teacher Chen also serving as the director. So I stayed in school and worked at the China Legal Research Institute, doing full-time research, doing projects, and writing articles. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; How many doctoral students studied with you under Professor Chen? Why were you the first doctoral student to graduate? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Frankly speaking, in the first year of enrollment, the instructor has candidates in mind , but you still have to follow the formal process when applying. At that time, unlike now, the papers were basically judged on the spot after the exam, and the results were known quickly. Finally, Teacher Chen recruited me, and also recruited someone from our school. He was a master&#39;s student in criminal law in 1984, just one class after me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Speaking of this, it is also a coincidence. If the school had recruited doctors in 1986, he had not graduated with a master&#39;s degree at that time, and we would not be classmates. . However, although we are both in the first batch of doctoral students, he is a full-time student, while I am a part-time PhD student because I have already stayed in school to work. According to the country&#39;s degree regulations at that time, those studying for a PhD on the job would have to study longer than those studying full-time. As for how long, there is no clear regulation. So I extended my studies by one year and graduated in 4 years. If calculated according to this time, it is possible that he graduated before me, then I will not become the first doctorate in criminal procedural law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But the students in the same class later went to study in the United States and never came back, leaving me alone to hold on. Later, I joked that if he didn&#39;t leave, he would definitely graduate before me, and the title of the first doctor of litigation law would belong to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Follow the teacher&#39;s steps&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekends:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first batch of 18 Ph.D.s was produced in 1983, but the first recipient of a doctorate in law was graduated in 1987. Among all disciplines, law is not a niche, and it is not too early to cultivate a doctorate in law. What do you think?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the reason for getting a doctorate in law is a little later. First, the doctoral program was of high value at that time. At that time, the approval of the doctoral program and the determination of the doctoral supervisor required the approval of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, which was very strictly controlled. The second reason is that from the perspective of faculty and research level, law was still a discipline with relatively scarce talents and did not have the conditions to train doctoral students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In 1988, Professor Chen Guangzhong edited the book &quot;Comparative Research on Foreign Criminal Proceedings&quot;. Three years later, your doctoral thesis &quot;Comparative Research on Criminal Prosecution Systems&quot; was approved. From a professional research perspective, did Professor Chen have a great influence on you? big? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Teacher Chen has always attached great importance to understanding and learning from foreign litigation systems. When we were still studying for master&#39;s degrees, there was a very lack of teaching materials. Basically, each school compiled and printed its own teaching materials. It happened that when Mr. Chen was the deputy dean of graduate students, he brought a topic from the Institute of Law of the Academy of Social Sciences on foreign criminal litigation. A comparative study of procedures. At that time, reform and opening up had already begun, and we were encouraged to study China&#39;s issues from a global perspective. Based on a group of experts from the Law Institute, Teacher Chen recruited some scholars from our school and other schools who studied this field to work together on this work. . Several of our classmates who are still studying for master&#39;s degrees also participated in part of it. I participated in writing a chapter, that is, compulsory medical measures, but I did not sign my name separately. I completed it under the guidance of my supervisor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, this book was the first domestic comparative and systematic study of foreign criminal procedure. It was both authoritative and precious. If you want to know more about it, If you know something about it abroad, you must read this book. For those of us who participated in writing this book, because writing required research on foreign materials, only the University of Political Science and Law had this condition at the time, so it was the first step for me to broaden my academic horizons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the previous In an article, you called Professor Chen &quot;the leading figure in criminal procedure law in New China.&quot; Do you have any observations about his academic studies and his conduct as a person? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Teacher Chen is a recognized master and an important founder and leader of our discipline. people. I feel that my husband&#39;s biggest specialty in learning is to learn from the best of other schools, to be open to all rivers, and to be tolerant, so later on he suddenly surpassed other teachers of his generation and was beyond the reach of others; the second is to know people and make good use of them, and make full use of their talents. Every time he writes something or works on a project, he can always hand over the relevant content to the most suitable person; the third thing is to be able to pay attention to and accept new things, and constantly improve himself by guiding students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to learning, the teacher also has a strong sense of responsibility and mission. He cares about current affairs and is now 93 years old. He is still paying attention to social phenomena and judicial practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Professor Chen’s Do personal traits influence you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Chen has had a great influence on me. Over the years, I can say that I have been closely related to him. He followed suit every step of the way. In addition to the master-disciple relationship, my position also determines why my behavior, knowledge and knowledge are closer to those of my husband. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; You and Professor Chen have been promoting the localization and application of some overseas experiences. In this process, what impact has reform and opening up had? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Chen is an iconic figure in the field of criminal procedure law in my country. The development and improvement of the criminal procedure system can be said to have made a great contribution and deserved the most credit. In terms of participation in legislation, when the Criminal Procedure Law was formulated in 1979, there were relatively few scholars involved. Mr. Chen was still in Guangxi at that time. I feel that this was his regret. The revision of the Criminal Procedure Law in 1996 was an opportunity to make amends, and Mr. Chen played a great role in the revision of the law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I still remember that in the winter of 1992, after Mr. Chen became the president of China University of Political Science and Law, his first symposium was held at the school. In the now demolished international student building, the director of the Criminal Law Office of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress came with the director. At that time, the law was being revised. In 1993, because I assisted Mr. Chen in promoting the first revision of the Criminal Procedure Law, I was sent to study at New York University as a core member of the research team. Later, I participated in an inspection delegation led by Mr. Chen to several European countries. The director of the Criminal Law Office of the Legal Affairs Commission also participated in the inspection. After returning to China, the Legal Affairs Committee formally sent a letter to the school, entrusting Mr. Chen to lead a research team to provide opinions on the revision of the law. A year later, Mr. Chen’s research team submitted a 350,000-word “Recommendation Draft for the Criminal Procedure Law of the People’s Republic of China” to the Legal Affairs Commission, of which 65% of the provisions were absorbed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to domestic projects, I assisted Mr. Chen in conducting some international exchanges and cooperation and conducting some comparative law research. For example, it selects students to study abroad, translates and publishes the criminal procedure codes of some representative countries, promotes the implementation of international human rights conventions and United Nations criminal justice guidelines in China, etc. It should be said that it has done a lot of useful things to promote the development and improvement of my country&#39;s criminal procedure system, and also promoted the discipline construction and talent cultivation of procedural law at China University of Political Science and Law. These were unique to the University of Political Science and Law at that time. Other schools neither had this team strength nor the necessary conditions and capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Amending the Constitution in 2004 At that time, Professor Chen proposed that &quot;the state respects and protects human rights&quot; be written into the Constitution; in 2012, when the Criminal Procedure Law was revised for the second time, this article was written into the Criminal Procedure Law. As his student, you have always advocated that criminal procedure law should protect individual rights. Why have you been so concerned about this issue? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Human rights protection is very closely related to criminal proceedings. Criminal procedure law is a typical field where public power operates and an important tool for national governance. For a long time, influenced by concepts, systems and even ideologies, we have regarded criminal proceedings as a contest between the state and crime, emphasizing the punishment of crimes, resulting in the lack of effective restrictions on the power of specialized state agencies in litigation activities. Correspondingly, the rights and interests of criminal suspects, defendants and other litigation participants cannot be fully protected. From the perspective of social development trends, the country&#39;s comprehensive promotion of governing the country according to law and building a country ruled by law means regulating public power through the rule of law and procedures to prevent power from being alienated and abused. Mr. Chen has a full understanding of this and has done a lot of work , through their own efforts to strengthen human rights protection in the judiciary, influence legislation, and improve the judiciary. Under the leadership of Mr. Chen, we have also made our own efforts and contributions to this end. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;It is not enough to do it yourself&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In a previous school lecture, you and the students discussed the vindication of unjust, false and wrongful convictions.

What do you think of this group? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The defense system and the lawyer profession reflect the level of the rule of law in a country. If the level of lawyers in a country is very weak and the defense system is not perfect, it is impossible to progress in criminal litigation. When the Criminal Procedure Law was formulated in 1979, there were basically no lawyers. Interim Regulations on Lawyers were only introduced in 1980. Therefore, the legislative provisions on lawyer defense are relatively backward. However, several revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law since 1996 have improved the lawyer defense system. Overall, the progress of the defense system is obvious to all. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But at the same time, it should be noted that there are still many problems in the legal provisions regarding lawyer defense, especially in judicial practice. I think one of the important reasons is that we have not found an accurate positioning of the lawyer profession and lawyer defense. In criminal proceedings, the defense lawyer&#39;s duty is to defend the defendant, find faults and discover problems from various angles such as facts, evidence, legal application, procedural operation, etc., so as to promote the fair handling of the case and thereby improve the level of the rule of law. By nature, lawyers do not exercise public power and are not members of the case-handling agency. Our management of lawyers is different. Lawyers are managed by judicial administrative agencies, which are part of the specialized state agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In judicial practice, in order to provide effective defense, to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the parties, or to ensure that legal procedures are complied with, lawyers need to be more truthful when performing their defense duties. Sometimes there are conflicts with the case-handling agencies, so some lawyers are called &quot;die-hard lawyers.&quot; But if they are not serious and fight to the death, they will not be able to protect the interests of the parties involved, and they will not be able to carry out defense work normally. Recently, some extreme examples have occurred, such as a court in Laibin, Guangxi, which forced lawyers to undergo security checks, made things difficult for them, and violated their legitimate rights and interests. This had a very bad impact, which attracted the attention of people across the country and was named by the Supreme Court. I think after such an extreme thing happens, the entire court system should take a warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Seems like this contradiction This is found in many of our legal systems. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is not enough to do it yourself. It does take time for the law on paper to become law in action, and various problems will arise during the implementation process. In a certain sense, many of the problems or difficulties faced in my country&#39;s current judicial practice are caused by the development of the system. Some things that seem good are actually very difficult to do. It may touch the interests of some people and even intensify conflicts. I believe that problems in development must still be solved by development. On the one hand, we must know more about the situation and pay attention to practice when designing the system; on the other hand, once the law is revised, the authority of the law must be maintained, and the case-handling agencies must strictly enforce the law. Take the lead in abiding by the law and earnestly abide by the procedures prescribed by law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In the past, everyone said that law is a humanities and social science, but now it is said that law is an engineering discipline within the humanities and social sciences. What do you think of this view? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no doubt that law is a humanities and social science, at least a discipline, or It is science, and it does have some attributes of engineering. Especially our discipline is very applicable and operable. When we studied in the past, we studied &quot;Criminal Procedure Law&quot;, but now it is called &quot;Criminal Procedure Law&quot;. The addition of the word &quot;study&quot; actually means that we realize that this is a science and a knowledge system. It is not just about interpreting the meaning of the law, but also using it to govern society and achieve good results. Taking the ascertainment of case facts as an example, it is not only an epistemological issue, but also involves axiology and methodology. Due procedures must be used to regulate the exercise of power by the case-handling agencies. Generally speaking, procedural law is an operational norm. It must have a specific set of principles, rules, methods, procedures and institutional norms, and it must be meticulous and operable, so that litigation activities can be followed by law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; With more than 40 years of study and academic experience, do you have any experience that you can share with young students? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Whether I am a scholar or a teacher, I actually learned from Mr. Chen , he set an example for us, teaching us to be patriotic and caring for the people, to have an open vision, and to have a spirit of research. This is what I strive to follow when doing academic work. In addition, I often remind students to care about current affairs and pay attention to the present. Many things happen around us every day, or there are examples closely related to our profession every day. Don&#39;t turn a deaf ear or be indifferent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for how to learn and how to write articles, this is indeed not an easy task. I think that first of all, individuals need to work hard, and at the same time, they also need opportunities. When we were studying, we should say that there were more opportunities. There was a shortage of people in front of us because of the passing of generations, and the society was in urgent need of talents, so that we would be the first in this and the first in that way. Nowadays, law has become a prominent school. Young people are under great pressure, but there are not many opportunities. Then they need to be more diligent, redouble their efforts, be calm, endure loneliness, and never let go of their youth. If they really learn, they will achieve something. There are times when you can use force and give appropriate rewards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《等待戈多》作者最喜欢的戏剧来中国，观众看得很精神]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260887]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A black box stood on the stage. &quot;Endgame&quot; had not officially started, but the two characters were already inside. Extremely similar clips are repeated over and over again, as if the stage has turned into a machine that plays on a loop due to malfunction. The servant Clover wrung his fingers and walked the same route repeatedly with a strange gait. He stepped back from the door to the right of Master Ham&#39;s wheelchair, walked to the corner on the left, and then to the door on the right, taking fourteen precise steps, every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dialogue has not changed either. &quot;Do you want me to leave you?&quot; &quot;Of course.&quot; &quot;Then I will leave you.&quot; &quot;You can&#39;t leave me.&quot; &quot;Then I won&#39;t leave you.&quot; The door was opened and closed again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1953, &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; brought Beckett worldwide fame, but his favorite work was &quot;Endgame&quot; written four years later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/9nCi5R8eQ6GQ8MC2uGTpV2Pz4rT7J40RVwMq7Zrj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/9nCi5R8eQ6GQ8MC2uGTpV2Pz4rT7J40RVwMq7Zrj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258749&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beckett&#39;s play &quot;Endgame&quot; will be performed at the 10th Wuzhen International Theater Festival in 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the organizer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This play shows four deformed people in an empty house that is approaching the end of the world. : The master Ham is paralyzed from the lower body, blind, and has been sitting in a wheelchair; the servant Clover has a disease in his knees and cannot sit down. Ham&#39;s parents, Nag and Nell, have lost their lower limbs and live in two trash cans. The relationships between masters and servants, husbands and wives, and parents and children all show an extremely cruel side, but they are interdependent and inseparable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the impression of Tobias Bianconi, Director General of the International Theater Association, in the past, the audience&#39;s reaction to Beckett and even absurdist plays was sometimes &quot;very frustrating and unhappy&quot;, but After he walked out of the theater, he found that after watching this version of the Vienna Volkstheater&#39;s performance, the Chinese audience was full of energy and had lively discussions. They all felt that the play was very fresh. &quot;Why is there such a reaction? What is the background that makes the audience like this play so much?&quot; he was curious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 20th century, which experienced the ravages of two world wars and was immersed in industrialization and the post-industrial era, the rationalism admired by Western civilization fell into crisis, belief in God collapsed, and self-doubt and self-denial became the themes of the times. This also brought profound conceptual changes to drama. What Beckett&#39;s drama expresses is the antagonistic relationship between human beings and nature, society, self and others who are completely alienated in social crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absurd drama, which was born in Paris, France, in the early 1950s, was echoed again in Wuzhen, China, seventy years later. &quot;At the beginning, we thought the most exciting thing was this very unhealthy and toxic relationship. Later we discovered that it had some parts related to war. As it slowly developed, we found that it might be related to climate change. Recently, We found that it was combined with the COVID-19 epidemic.&quot; During the dialogue, theater director and German director Kai Vogels said that this version of &quot;Endgame&quot; has been performed for eleven years. &quot;The point of it being constantly performed is that it is always new. , what we see from this drama keeps changing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18 /yJd8u4hbNeQQHztSBQk6L0OvaD60hZLYPPyafubF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/yJd8u4hbNeQQHztSBQk6L0OvaD60hZLYPPyafubF.j pg&quot; data -key=&quot;258748&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beckett&#39;s play &quot;Endgame&quot; was written in the late 1950s. The version that came to China has already been sold in Europe Acted for eleven years. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the organizer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vogels refined the four characters into two clown-like people, retaining the main theme A very tense contrast between servants: Ham is physically disabled, but has the power to control Clover; Clough is relatively able to move freely, but is always dominated by his master to do unnecessary trivial things, and his spirit tends to be paralyzed. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most eye-catching adaptation is Vogels’ emphasis on the sense of looping. The line, which was on an infinite loop before the show even started, only appeared once in the original script. Vogels uses this as the opening or closing line of every dialogue, repeating it a dozen times throughout the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new plot in the play brings an &quot;anti-climax&quot;: after Clover struggled, he shot Hamm, but the expected relief brought by death did not happen. After the monologue, Ham suddenly answered and got up from the ground, as if nothing had happened. Clover and he returned to their usual endless conversation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Beckett actually demonstrated a ritual cycle on the stage. The ending of this ritual cycle is satisfaction, nothingness, or the end of the world. Everyone can see it differently. Each point has its own interpretation, and what I present on the stage also has this meaning.&quot; At the beginning of the rehearsal, Vogels hoped to show the inextricable cycle of repetition on the stage without making the audience feel bored. This balance Feeling is what he is looking for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1998 Vogels has been a theater and opera director in Austria and Germany. German theater is relatively lagging behind in digital innovation. From 2010 to 2020, while serving as the artistic director of the Dortmund Theater in Germany, Vogels began to try to combine digital media with theater and introduce digital thinking to the theater stage. He is a pioneer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among these works, digital techniques such as VR, real-time imaging, and on-site editing are emerging in endlessly. &quot;Endgame&quot; pursues Beckett&#39;s minimalist style. However, the artificially isolated cramped space, heavy metal-style amplified sound effects, The sudden switching of dazzling lights, the characters&#39; mechanically looping movements and lines, all give this picture of the human spiritual wasteland a cold science fiction color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more traditional images such as &quot;desert&quot; and &quot;dead branches&quot; in Beckett&#39;s original work are missing. In terms of stage design, the play chose a form that abstracted away from reality. Like the door, the few sets and props are all outlined with white chalk lines. Three-dimensional life seems to be locked in two-dimensional space. Machine guns and toy dogs are just thin wooden boards hanging on the wall when they are not picked out by actors and held in their hands. The clock has no hands and the flowers in the vase are out of proportion. The only two real objects are the wooden chair with armrests in the center of the stage and the light bulb hanging in the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actors&#39; performances are consistent with German precision, and they achieve the ultimate in repetitive movements with slight changes. The actors who played Ham sat on the chair with eyes closed with their eyes, but still showed a strong dominance and oppression in the relationship through tone and gesture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The sound is the third &quot;starring&quot; of this play, which expands the information and emotional density in the minimalist world. Klau&#39;s footsteps are constantly echoing in the space, powerful, but as flat as the scenery, you can&#39;t hear a specific sense of direction. A strong conflict between footsteps and no directions. Every time Klau drops down the things, it will make a huge cracking sound, regardless of the telescope, machine gun or toy dog. The laws of the physical world have failed here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two who are both master and servant and their father and son are imprisoned in the depth of death. Their house is indeed like the chessboard in the final of the international chess game in a sense. Ham is a general on the chessboard. He needs to ensure that he is in the &quot;center&quot; position of the house and controls his chess pieces. Crowv&#39;s soldier can also reluctantly move a few steps. However, under the command of the blind man Ham, the situation that must be lost has been determined, but they cannot and dare not leave the house, just as the chess pieces cannot leave the chessboard. Outside the house, &quot;there is no nature&quot;, and even pushed the window, seeing &quot;Zero (None)&quot; written on the blackboard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They pass the time in jokes, control, torture each other, tell the stories that have been talked about again, and read the window that has already overlooking countless times. In the bottom of the eyes, some people walked through the window. However, their expectations were empty, and all the moves were not meaningful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the end of the show, I found that the opening was the final. &quot;What time is it?&quot; &quot;Like usual.&quot; They said the dialogue when they first opened. Everything stopped abruptly, the remaining silence and darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[冒充专家行医十年，靠秘方自制抗癌药：无证“神医”的罪与罚]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260877]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-19 08:59:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; God Doctor &quot;to sell a pile of titles to patients.

Southern Weekend reporters inquired online on the referee documents that in the fake drug cases in recent years, the first trial of the Hou Yuanxiang case was very rare for the weight of torture and the amount of fines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the case has not yet been settled. After the first trial judgment, as Hou Yuanxiang and others appealed, many self -media appeared on the Internet to &quot;shout the grievance&quot; for it, and some associated the case &quot;folk Chinese medicine&quot; group, saying that &quot;the lawsuit lost, almost all &#39;folks have lost.

According to him, the two police officers were in one class, three shifts, and looked at him 24 hours. A native of Yishui County, Linyi City, provincial, once worked as a teacher in the county, followed up for a suspension of salary, and changed his career to be a doctor. Since then, the family was moved to Weifang to settle. Around 2019, after purchasing real estate in Qingdao, the Hou Yuanxiang and his daughter Hou Jing mounted the hukou to Qingdao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession in the first instance judgment did not explain his experience in studying medicine. Some media said that Hou Yuanxiang was Zhang Moumou and Lou Moumou from two &quot;famous Chinese medicine medicine&quot;, but the southern weekend reporters did not find the latter two as a &quot;famous Chinese medicine&quot; information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, it is certain that Hou Yuanxiang is not a &quot;family of six generations&quot; and &quot;six generations of medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s wife and sister to China News Weekly, Hou Yuanxiang was originally a elementary school teacher. He started to study medicine around 40 years old. The relative emphasized that Hou Yuanxiang &quot;was powerful&quot; -whether it was cancer and what cancer &quot;knew it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a daughter -in -law, Li Jianying told the southern weekend that she did not know how Hou Yuanxiang learned Chinese medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most patients call Hou Yuanxiang as &quot;Professor Hou&quot;, and Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s WeChat personality signature is also &quot;Professor Hou&quot;.

Since the implementation of the Practicer Law in 1999, whether it is Chinese medicine or western medicine, medicine must have a physician practice certificate, otherwise it is &quot;illegal medicine&quot;, and it will be punished by administrative penalties and criminal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A patient with a surname of Xu said that she began to find Hou Yuanxiang to see a doctor in 2014.

During the hospital, he found that Hou didn&#39;t get a physician practice certificate, and he doubted his identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Not only patients, but even some senior medical circles have confident Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s identity and ability. According to the first trial judgment, Hou Yuanxiang had a long -term consultation in the De Medical Hall of the Private Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Qingdao. Later, the person in charge of the German Medical Hall asked Hou Yuanxiang to hang the qualifications of the physician in the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the testimony of Shen Yufa, the dean of Zibo Yiyuan Ruikang Hospital, before 2010, he met Hou Yuanxiang at a medical academic meeting in Beijing. Tumor, cancer, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular are famous. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Later, Shen Yufa&#39;s wife got cancer and used Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made medicine. Shen Yufa also hired Hou as the &quot;part -time professor&quot; of Ruikang Hospital and sold Hou medicine in the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession, Shen Yufa invited him to take a clinic at Ruikang Hospital, but he refused because he did not have a physician&#39;s practice certificate, and the two sides only sold drugs to cooperate. However, the son of Shen Yufa and the other employees of the hospital confirmed that Hou Yuanxiang was in the hospital for irregularities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to private hospitals, there are also public hospitals who have worked with Hou Yuanxiang. In 2016, as a public hospital, the Weifang Municipal Organ Organ Hospital had issued a post on his WeChat public account, saying that Hou Yuanxiang was a &quot;international cancer research authoritative expert&quot; and will go to the Chinese Medical Branch for consultation every month. This article has only disappeared recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The patients believe that Hou Yuanxiang, in addition to his online resume, is also dazzling, but also because of its &quot;accurate&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Dong Shijie is the relative of a patient with a Jilin patient. According to him, Hou Yuanxiang travels to Changbai Mountain, entertains to eat by herself, and Hou Yuanxiang lives on the spot. &quot;There is a friend who has high blood lipids and high blood pressure, and he can touch it.&quot; Dong Shijie told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, according to the first instance judgment, Hou Yuanxiang acknowledged that he would not actually be pulse. The reason why pretending to be the pulse is &quot;to put it plainly to let the patient buy medicine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When I learned that Hou Yuanxiang would not be a pulse, Dong Shijie was shocked: &quot;He is a Chinese medicine, he won&#39;t see what he is seeing?&quot; >; &lt;p>; According to the judgment of the first instance, since 2011, Hou Yuanxiang, Hou Jing and others have not obtained the drug production license and the drug business license, etc., and have invested in the false personal introduction of Hou Yuanxiang on the Internet. Consultation and sales claim to be anti -cancer drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s fake medicine case, the first thing that happened was her daughter Hou Jing -like her father, she also had no physician practice certificate. On January 16, 2022, after receiving a complaint report, multiple departments in Huangdao District, Qingdao jointly law enforcement, arrested Hou Jing on the spot. Subsequently, Hou Jing confessed Hou Yuanxiang and his brother Hou Lei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the judgment of the first trial, Hou Yuanxiang was in the home of Weifang at that time. He didn&#39;t seem to care about it at first. After Hou Jing was detained and asked by the police, he realized that the situation was serious. And production tools, but it is too late. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The court of first instance found that after Hou Jing was detained, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s wife went to the police station where he handled the case to inquire the news. After returning home, he &quot;hidden the family&quot;, and the police pursued the Hou family online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Lei&#39;s confession, Hou Jingxiang called him the next day, Hou Jing was arrested. &quot;Two or three days later, my father said that this is not small. Let me not use my current mobile phone. Let me go out to hide. After hanging up, I will take out the mobile phone card and throw the trash.&quot; &lt;/P >; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As for how Hou Lei participated in these business, Hou Lei said that in the winter of 2019, Hou Yuanxiang &quot;let my wife Li Jianying apply for a bank card ... let me pretend to install me ... Director Li of the hospital, some patients called me when they wanted to buy medicine, and asked me to send the bank card to the patient and let the patient make money. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession, Hou Jing&#39;s relationship with Hou Lei is not good. Hou Lei knows that after Hou Jing made money, he also wanted to follow his father to sell medicines. The formula was just let Hou Lei follow him, and he paid him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Jianying told reporters from the Southern Weekend that Hou Lei helped Hou Yuanxiang in Weifang, &quot;equivalent to a courier.&quot; In the first trial judgment, Hou Lei was sentenced to &quot;crime of production and sales of fake medicines&quot;, with a sentence of 8 years and a fine of 5 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Lei&#39;s confession, after hiding for a few days, he received a call from Hou Yuanxiang with a strange number and proposed to go to the three aunts&#39; house in Qingdao to celebrate the New Year, and then the whole family arrived at the third aunt&#39;s house. According to Hou Lei&#39;s confession, because he felt that &quot;it was quite big&quot;, he suggested that his father vote for the case, &quot;My father is very angry, saying that I am not his own.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hou Lei&#39;s son Li Shuai told Hou Lei that he had a relationship to settle the matter, but it took 4 million yuan. After several communication, Hou Lei asked his ex -brother Fu Songjie to send Li Shuai to Li Shuai to 2 million yuan in cash after paying 500,000 yuan. Li Shuai confessed that when he saw Fu Songjie with a sack of money, he was stunned: &quot;I saw so much money for the first time.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Fu Songjie was originally a district in Weifang City Attorney of general surgery of the People&#39;s Hospital, in 2019, he resigned to Qingdao under his ex -wife Hou Jing. Before his resignation, Hou Yuanxiang found him and asked him to be the legal representative of a private hospital in Hou Shen&#39;s shares. After Fu Songjie arrived in Qingdao, because he caught up with the epidemic, he did not settle in his work. Fu Songjie was sentenced to 3 years in the first instance and fined 500,000 yuan. The sentence was the least of all person involved. Fu was the only one who did not appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After Hou Lei was arrested, he confessed Li Shuai. In the next three days, Li Shuai, Fu Songjie and Hou Yuanxiang were arrested one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Yuanxiang, in addition to the above 2.5 million yuan, Li Shuai also deceived him more than 2 million yuan. The first instance judgment confirmed the incident and stated that &quot;the public security organs will be investigated separately.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s false medicine case, the police checked the 8 houses of Hou&#39;s house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In late February 2022, after Hou Yuanxiang was arrested for a week, the Ministry of Public Security announced the first 8 major typical cases of drug crimes listed in supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The &quot;secret recipe&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s case, the fake medicine is the four medicines made by Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s father and daughter, which are named &quot; Anti -Cancer No. 1 and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot;. According to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession, these two medicines are made based on a &quot;secret recipe&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Hou Yuanxiang said differently about the origin of this &quot;secret recipe&quot;. During the investigation stage of the case, he said that the secret recipe comes from a &quot;second grandfather&quot;. This recipe originally had 5 medicines. On the basis of this, Hou Yuanxiang added shiitake mushrooms, ganoderma, and Cordyceps. I have always wanted to promote this prescription to sell medicines to make money. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, at the stage of the trial, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s statement on the &quot;secret recipe&quot; changed -he said that Fangzi was presented by his &quot;teacher&quot; at the end of 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s different rhetoric about the source of the secret recipe made a second -instance agent lawyer also felt puzzled: &quot;The truth may only be known by himself.&quot; The lawyer said that Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s anti -cancer &quot;secret recipes&quot; include shiitake mushrooms, Cordyceps, Ganoderma, Plagractic, Black Jujube, Kunbu, Niu Gen, Dandelion Gen, Ginseng, Astragalus, Angelica and other Chinese medicinal materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A Chinese medicine medicine that has been in the world for more than forty years told the southern weekend reporter that these traditional Chinese medicinal materials in Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s Fangzi have both &quot;replenishing&quot; and &quot;attack&quot;. Astragalus, cancer patients in the middle and late stages, most of them are weak in their bodies, and they are good for using some tonic; &quot;attack&quot; such as Kunbu has the effect of clearing heat and dispersing, but it is only suitable for some early tumor patients and is not suitable for advanced stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among the patients of Hou Yuanxiang, there are many advanced cancer patients, and some are found by Hou Yuanxiang because they are &quot;sentenced to death by the hospital.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Different from the &quot;grabbing medicine&quot; in Chinese medicine, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s anti -cancer drugs are cooked in advance, and they are sold to the patient after bagging. According to his confession, Around November 2020, Hou Jing purchased a machine to make soup medicine. Since then, his father and daughter took turns to use this machine to boil the medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The price of &quot;Anti -Cancer No. 1&quot; is 4620 yuan per service, and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot; is 1920 yuan. Eat a course of treatment with a course, 12 days a course of treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made anti -cancer drugs, Zhao Yin, a lawyer who graduated from the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and worked at the Chinese Medicine Department of the Hospital for many years, believes that he must be illegal. According to her, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s homemade medicine, similar to the &quot;medical institution (traditional Chinese medicine) preparation&quot; in the hospital, refers to a fixed prescription preparation that is prepared and used by medical institutions according to the clinical needs of the unit. However, the hospital preparations are the same as drugs. Generally, the approval of the drug regulatory department can be produced and sold, and in principle, only the hospital can only be used for the hospital for use, and it cannot be sold outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhao Yin said that after the introduction of the Chinese Medicine Law in 2017, the state&#39;s management of traditional Chinese medicine preparations has been relaxed. The provincial drug supervision and management department can be prepared after being recorded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made medicine also did not record. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Traditional Chinese Medicine Law stipulates that the medical institution formulates a Chinese medicine preparation that should be recorded but not filed, and a penalty is punished according to the production of fake drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhao Yin still doubts whether Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s homemade anticancer drugs really contain a sufficient amount of Chinese medicinal materials such as Cordyceps claims in the &quot;Secret Recipe&quot;, because the medicine is made by Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s father and daughter. The production standards for production lack due supervision and supervision. Quantitative testing such as Cordyceps is very difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Fu Songjie&#39;s confession, Hou Jing will send Liuwei Dihuang Pills and other Chinese medicines to the patient with the well -boiled Chinese medicine solution. In Zhao Yin&#39;s opinion, in this way, even if the patient feels effective after taking the medicine, it may be the role of proprietary Chinese medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to avoid the qualitative of &quot;fake medicine&quot;, Hou Yuanxiang tried to argue with &quot;medicine and food&quot;, which means that he sold food. However, because the names of &quot;Anti -Cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot; were marked, it made it difficult for him to justify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhao Yin believes that the drug name of &quot;Anti -Cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot; itself is nice, because cancer is the concept of Western medicine, and Chinese medicine generally does not have the saying of &quot;cancer&quot; or &quot;tumor&quot;. It is called the &quot;symptom accumulation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made anti -cancer drugs, the above -mentioned Chinese medicine interviewed by reporters in the southern weekend directly called &quot;too boldness&quot;. In his opinion, many Chinese medicines have secret recipes. In order not to leak the secret recipes, they generally only sell medicinal materials to patients, at most to help patients fry on behalf of them. They must not dare to sell them to patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Are there any cancer patients being cured? &lt;/H4>; &lt;p>; However, supporters have &quot;shouted unjust&quot; on the Internet on the grounds that Hou Yuanxiang cured many cancer patients. However, the southern weekend reporter&#39;s investigation found that whether there was cancer patients was really cured by Hou Yuanxiang, it was a question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the first trial of the Hou Yuanxiang case, a list of cancer patients who claimed to be &quot;cured by Hou Yuanxiang&quot; were flowing on the Internet. There were personal information of 31 patients or family members of patients on the list. This list is consistent with the southern weekend reporters with one of Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s supporters Gong Feiyun. According to Gong Feiyun, at the end of June 2023, he went to Qingdao to meet Hou Yuanxiang. It was the list given by Hou Yuanxiang himself. Gong Feiyun is a partner of a Chinese medicine museum in a foreign country. He has also been involved in the storm of fake drugs in the past few years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A reporter on the Southern Weekend called all 31 calls on the list, of which 11 were unaware, 13 rejected, and 7 of the 7 connected telephones acknowledged whether they were on the list. Family members, another person denied that he was the &quot;Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau Director&quot; Che Moumou, who was written by the list, claiming that he was &quot;running business.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among the 6 people, 3 of them refused to interview on the grounds that &quot;there was something&quot; and &quot;involved privacy&quot;, and only 3 people accepted telephone interviews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The patient Song Yuan&#39;s family was from Qingdao, Shandong. He claimed to be &quot;sentenced to death by the hospital&quot; and found Hou Yuanxiang with a mentality of trying. Nothing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Song and Yuan family told the southern weekend reporter that Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s medicine was &quot;ancestral medicine&quot;, which did not give medicine. He spent more than 200,000 yuan. Okay, eat &#39;Anti -Cancer No. 2&#39; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the judgment of the first trial, when Hou Yuanxiang transferred the pharmaceutical and production tools overnight, he asked the Song Yuan family to help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Song and Yuan family told reporters to the south weekend that he had read Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s first trial judgment, but he was more willing to believe in the &quot;shouting injustice&quot; video on the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another interviewee Wang Jingjiang is a village in Zibo, Shandong, and the patient is his mother -in -law. He said that Hou Yuanxiang had planned to build a nursing home in the village, and he drove the village secretary at the time, so he met Hou. Later, his mother -in -law had cancer, and there was no possibility of surgery. After a period of chemotherapy, he contacted &quot;Professor Hou&quot;, &quot;at that time, he was sick.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Jingjiang said that Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s medicine was &quot;good&quot;, and his mother -in -law felt &quot;energetic&quot;, but because he couldn&#39;t stand the taste, he stopped drinking anymore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the view of the drafting and demonstration experts of the Chinese Medicine Law, the lawyer Yang Fengzhu, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s &quot;anti -cancer drug&quot; is mixed together. Although the Chinese medicine treatment is rarely &quot;immediate&quot;, it is not There is no effect, &quot;You replenish qi (Chinese medicine), it must be effective.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; And Wang Jingjiang also emphasized: his mother -in -law was not &quot;cured&quot;, but &quot;no (no) criminals, no metastasis&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The third interviewee Li Cheng (pseudonym) is Jilin Yanbian. He told the southern weekend that the patient was his grandfather, and he did find Hou Yuanxiang to see the illness and had taken his own medicine. The old man has died in September 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Cheng said that Grandpa was diagnosed with rectal cancer in July 2019 and has spread to lymphatic. Relatives introduced him to Hou Yuanxiang. He has never seen Hou Yuanxiang so far, and the two are mainly contacted through WeChat. He said that after adding WeChat, Hou Yuanxiang sent his personal profile, &quot;What world cancer, what committee, what kind of cancer treatment experts, I also searched on Baidu, and I can really find this person. sharp&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When receiving a call from the reporter from the Southern Weekend, Li Cheng still said that Hou Yuanxiang was &quot;Professor Hou&quot;. When he learned that Hou Yuanxiang was not a professor, even when he had no physician practice certificate, he was surprised, saying that if he knew the situation at the beginning, he had to find Hou Yuanxiang to see a doctor &quot;consider.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Cheng said that in addition to drinking Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s anti -cancer drugs, Grandpa also ate the &quot;nutritional meal&quot; recommended by Hou Yuanxiang. &quot;After eating three courses, (grandpa) recovered well.&quot; Li Cheng said, for this reason, he also introduced many patients to Hou Yuanxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Li Cheng couldn&#39;t confirm that his grandfather&#39;s condition improved for a time. Li Cheng said, &quot;We all say (Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s medicine) and good use of the management and goodness may also support the spiritual state of Grandpa.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Yang Fengzhu has participated in many clinical trial arguments in drugs . In his opinion, when patients do treatment, &quot;psychological effects are important and can affect 30%(treatment) effects.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Cheng also said that during the period of taking Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s medicine, Grandpa also performed other treatments including surgery, &quot;Chinese and Western medicine synchronized.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; After the fake medicine &quot;slimming&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Whether it is an agent lawyer or Hou Yuanxiang himself, they will not expect to be so heavy in the first instance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, according to relevant laws and regulations and the amount involved in the case found by the driver agency, once Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made medicine is identified as a fake medicine, it cannot be judged lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the first instance, many acting lawyers of the Hou family carried out innocent or guilty defense on the grounds that Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s homemade medicine did not cause harm or consequences. Hou Yuanxiang himself also proposed that his medicine &quot;can drink&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, without causing damage, it does not mean that Hou Yuanxiang does not constitute a &quot;crime of production and sales of fake medicines&quot;, nor does it mean that it cannot be re -sentenced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the criminal law before the amendment in 2011, it constitutes the crime of &quot;production and sales of fake drugs&quot;. There is a need for &quot;serious harm to human health&quot;, which will cause death or serious injuries to sentence them to more than ten years in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhao Yin said that in order to increase the crackdown on fake drugs, the eighth amendment of the 2011 Criminal Law amended the &quot;crime of production and sales of fake drugs&quot;. &quot;As a threshold for crime, as long as it is produced and sold for fake drugs, it constitutes a crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the same time, the eighth amendment of the Criminal Law will no longer take death and serious injuries as the only condition for the severe sentence. It stipulates that there are &quot;other particularly serious plots&quot; and can also be sentenced. In 2014, the judicial interpretation of the Supreme Law and the highest detection desk, as long as the production and sales of fake drugs reached 500,000 yuan, they constituted the &quot;other particularly serious plots&quot; in the eighth amendment of the Criminal Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The amount of Hou Yuanxiang produced and sold fake drugs, the court of first instance was determined to be more than 14.36 million yuan, far exceeding 500,000 yuan. This means that once Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made medicine is identified as a fake medicine, it is suitable for sentenced to more than ten years in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Whether Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s homemade medicine can be regarded as fake medicine is based on the drug management law. Zhao Yin believes that before the revision of the law in 2019, the identification of fake drugs is relatively simple -as long as the drugs do not obtain a batch number, they will be in line with &quot;fake medicine theory&quot;, which constitutes fake drugs in the sense of criminal law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the revised drug management law in 2019 has made a major modification of the definition of fake drugs. Drugs that do not obtain a batch number are no longer the presence of fake drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The industry generally believes that the above -mentioned amendments to the Drug Management Law are related to the Hunan Lu Yong case. Lu Yong, a patient with leukemia, purchased generic drugs from the informal channels and helped the patients to purchase this medicine. In 2018, the film &quot;I&#39;m Not the God of Medicine&quot; based on its prototype was released, which caused public opinion to discuss the Chinese drug management system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The revised Drug Management Law &quot;lose weight&quot; for fake medicines, and only four cases can be set as fake medicines (see the post -post data link). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Cao Guoying, director of the Beijing Yangtze River Pharmacy Development Foundation, who has long been engaged in drug counterfeit practices and research, introduced that after the revision of the Drug Management Law, the fake drug case handled by the pharmaceutical regulatory department was &quot;cliff -type decline&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the website data of the State Drug Administration, in 2019, the number of fake drugs investigated and dealt with by the drug regulatory department in 2019 is 14041, and the following year after the revision of the Drug Management Law, the number of such cases in this case is Only 7361, a reduction of nearly half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The southern weekend reporter searched on the referee document network with &quot;fake medicine&quot; as the keyword. It was found that the number of criminal cases of criminal cases from the drug management law was revised. 2361 pieces, more than half. It has also declined in the past few years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The 2019 version of the Drug Management Law, while &quot;slimming&quot; with fake drugs, has greatly increased fines. &quot;The starting point of the fine is 15 times the production sales amount, and less than 100,000 are calculated by 100,000.&quot; Zhao Yin said, &quot;As long as it is production and sales of fake drugs, at least 1.5 million will be fined. &quot;Sales fake drugs).&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; Is Chinese medicinal materials a medicine? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In Cao Guoying&#39;s view, in the current overall environment of drugs, Qingdao can investigate and deal with the Hou Yuanxiang case &quot;very difficult&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, whether Hou Yuanxiang should be held criminally responsible for &quot;production and sales of fake medicines&quot;, but both in the legal and Chinese medicine community have caused controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The acting lawyer of the Hou family is based on the revised drug management law in 2019. It is believed that Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s homemade drug is made of Chinese medicine materials as raw materials. The crime of selling fake medicines. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, according to the first trial of the Hou Yuanxiang case, the public security organs were initially established by Hou Yuanxiang and others with &quot;illegal business crimes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; One month after filing the case, the Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau issued a fake medicine identification letter, which was identified as a fake medicine for the four homemade drugs of Hou Yuanxiang. According to the relevant judicial interpretations issued by the highest law and the highest detection in 2014, it is difficult to determine the &quot;fake drugs&quot; and &quot;inferior drugs&quot;, and the judicial organs can determine the determination opinions issued by the drug supervision and management departments above the city level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the above identification, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made &quot;Anti -Cancer No. 1&quot;, &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot;, &quot;liver&quot; claiming to treat liver cancer, and &quot;wild heart brain soup&quot; used to treat heart disease The medicine is identified as a fake medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the case entered the review and prosecution stage, at the request of the People&#39;s Procuratorate of Huangdao District, the Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau specially issued a supplementary explanation to explain why the products involved were identified as fake medicines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Instructions point out that Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s four self -made products &quot;no drug registration certificate, no medical institution preparation filing, no drug production license, no medical institution preparation permit, no national standard, etc. Pharmaceuticals that promote the treatment of cancer, liver cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, etc. are sold to patients to cure diseases. P>; &lt;p>; A second -instance agent lawyer pointed out that on the one hand, the above discussion said that the product involved in the case was &quot;in line with the definition of drugs&quot;, and on the other hand, it was &quot;non -drug&quot;. In its opinion, the reason why Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau discusses this is because according to the New Drug Management Law, &quot;the only thing that can be stuck is this one (non -pharmaceutical impersonation).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made medicine identification issues, the reporter from the southern weekend contacted the Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau. The bureau refused to interview on the grounds of the Hou Yuanxiang case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the first instance, almost all the acting lawyers of the Hou family questioned the false drug determination of the case. One of the lawyers pointed out that most of the medicinal materials used in &quot;Anti -Cancer 1&quot; and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot; were in the 2020 version of &quot;Chinese Pharmacopoeia&quot;, which did not conform to &quot;impersonation of medicines with non -drug&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, in Zhao Yin&#39;s view, Chinese medicinal materials are not of course considered medicines -Chinese medicinal materials are only raw materials for making drugs and can be sold in the medicinal material market. Sale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Where is the medicinal materials used by Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s father and daughter&#39;s self -made medicine? There is no explanation in the relevant confession quoted in the first instance judgment, and Hou Jing cannot provide the purchase of the purchase and legal certification documents. According to Hou Jing&#39;s ex -husband Fu Songjie, Hou Jing&#39;s herbal medicines were sent through express delivery and logistics. The consignee generally used a pseudonym. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Gang, the acting lawyer of the second instance, questioned the fake drugs involved in the case involved in the case of the case, and questioned the fake drug identification letter based on the judgment of the first trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the newly introduced judicial interpretation of the highest law and the highest prosecution in 2022 (the old judicial interpretation of the old judicial interpretation in 2014), the situation of &quot;non -drug pretending to medicine&quot; can only be in the case where there is no controversy. Below, the municipal pharmaceutical regulatory department can be directly identified as fake medicine. For controversy, it is necessary to check or determine the pharmaceutical inspection agency set by the drug supervision and management department of the provincial level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Li Gang&#39;s view, the identification of the fake drugs involved in the case of Hou Yuanxiang obviously controversial and should be tested. However, he believes that folk traditional Chinese medicine recipes lack national standards, and even if the results are tested, it lacks scientific and legitimacy. And Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s medicine was not tested at the time, and now it has been seized for more than a year. &quot;It has been deteriorated early, how to test it?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; On November 5, 2023, another agent lawyer of Hou Yuanxiang told the Southern Weekend reporter that After the case was returned to the retrial, the procuratorial organs supplemented a lot of evidence to the court, including a inspection report on Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -pharmaceutical. According to this inspection report, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made drug detected the western medicine composition to treat diabetes. The Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau still determined that the product involved was a fake medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s above -mentioned acting lawyer said that this shows that the pharmaceutical regulatory department may no longer determine the product involved in the case in accordance with the &quot;non -pharmaceutical impersonation medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s charges, Yang Zhiwei, a lawyer of Guangdong Fa Quan Law Firm, put forward another point of view to reporters from the south weekend: if Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s &quot;Anti -Cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot; are clear and treating cancer &quot;Do not match the world&quot;, Hou Yuanxiang is entirely the purpose of selling medicines, so he may constitute a crime of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A reporter from the Southern Weekend found such a case on the referee document network: In 2019, Li Mouxiang, who did not qualify for medicine, was arrested for production and sales of fake drugs, but the Procuratorate arrested and arrested him with fraud. The court was sentenced to 14 years in prison for fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Is Hou Yuanxiang suspected of fraud? A reporter from the Southern Weekend asked about a first -instance lawyer of Hou Yuanxiang. After a few seconds of silence, the lawyer asked: Scam? Isn&#39;t that heavier? Later, he said that Hou Yuanxiang was &quot;unlikely&quot; to constitute a crime of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another first -instance lawyer of Hou Yuanxiang believes that Hou Yuanxiang constitutes &quot;the crime of obstructing drug management&quot;. The crime was newly established in the 11th Amendment of the Criminal Law issued in 2020. It pointed to the criminal behavior of drugs that did not obtain a batch number but not obtained by the production and sales. light. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The lawyer did not accept interviews with reporters from the Southern Weekend, but said such a sentence: &quot;If he is sentenced to being innocently guilty of his (Hou Yuanxiang) family, then we can do anything in the name of traditional Chinese medicine to do traditional Chinese medicine. . &quot;&lt;/P>;

&lt;p>;该律师所说的媒体指的是网络自媒体。 In fact, the media reports of the mainstream institutions reported Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s fake medicine cases after the second instance ruling was returned to retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在自媒体助力下，本来名不见经传的侯元祥，被描述为一位被冤判的“治癌神医”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“有公安背景的女子”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年3月中旬，侯元祥假药案一审判决一个多月后，一篇题为《九岁鑫鑫求助：妈妈救治三千多癌症患者却被判刑十一年，罚款三千万》的文章开始在网上传播。该文称，侯元祥女儿侯静用中药祖传秘方治好了很多疑难杂症，但其所配制的中药液被青岛市监局“毫无依据”地定为假药，侯静一审判刑11年，全家牵连。文中还附上了侯静9岁儿子对外求助的照片：“妈妈您治病救人何罪之有啊？让全国网友替你评论吧……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此文引发网友热议。 The reporter from the Southern Weekend noticed that this article emphasizes that Hou Jing graduated from the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and was a Chinese medicine division, but he could not mention Hou Jing without a physician&#39;s practice certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥儿媳李建英告诉南方周末记者，一审判决后，侯元祥想利用网络“喊冤”，当时曾要她家孩子的照片，她担心孩子会受影响，就没给。后来才用了侯静儿子的照片。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年6月底，自媒体人吴鹏飞开始介入侯元祥假药案。吴鹏飞自称“老新闻工作者”和“知名网络作家”，在抖音、快手、今日头条等平台均开设有账号。南方周末记者查询发现，吴鹏飞早年曾在湖北省内一家媒体任职，离开媒体后成立了一家策划营销公司。在开始介入侯元祥假药案时，吴鹏飞就曝出一个大新闻：一位有公安背景的女士曾开价一千万，要买侯元祥的治疗秘方，遭到拒绝后曾威胁说，要让侯元祥一家人等着坐牢。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有多个自媒体博主引用了吴鹏飞上述说法，以至于“有公安背景的女子强买药方不成举报侯元祥”一说，成为侯元祥假药案的主流网络舆论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，侯元祥的二审代理律师李刚向南方周末记者表示，他虽然听侯元祥说过此事，但并没有看到相关证据，侯元祥也没向司法机关提出有人敲诈勒索他的控告。作为律师，他对这个说法“不予置评”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥的一审代理律师杨子宁也告诉南方周末记者，上述说法“在（案）卷里体现不出来”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者注意到，2020年新冠疫情时，吴鹏飞曾力捧过另一位“神医”——宣称注射苯酚能治好新冠的无证医生李跃华，还发布消息称李跃华受韩国邀请前往抗疫，但该消息被韩国官方否认，李跃华本人也对媒体表示他不知道此事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者试图联系吴鹏飞，但截至发稿，对方未回复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“民间调查可靠性有多大？”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在发出上述文章之后，吴鹏飞又在多个平台上连续发布题为《民间中医冤案》的短视频，如今已经播到第100集，其中仅抖音平台一家的播放量就已超过1600万。在这些短视频中，吴鹏飞称侯元祥为“侯老”，说他是“中医治癌第一人”，有“独门医术”和“惊世疗效”，“堪称一位国宝”，“身上的每根汗毛都是金子”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，吴鹏飞还引用了一组数据，以表明侯元祥是“治癌神医”。他说，“一家全国性民间中医组织”对中国十大治癌名老中医的疗效进行了调查：“第一名就是侯元祥，当时确认他治好的癌症患者是1166人，第二名老中医确认治好的仅有11人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李建英也向南方周末记者表示，侯元祥“治好了”1166个癌症病人。 “他（侯元祥）都有记录的。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，吴鹏飞没有说“全国性民间中医组织”究竟是哪家机构。事实上，就连李刚也对吴鹏飞所说的数据持有疑问：“民间调查可靠性有多大？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在另一个短视频里，吴鹏飞说侯元祥治愈了三千多名癌症patient.而在“央地健康”网（一个声称为“民间医师”提供交流、展示、推广服务的网站）的个人介绍里，侯元祥则是“治愈两万多癌症”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也有自媒体对侯元祥提出质疑，不过点击量与吴鹏飞的短视频不可同日而语。自媒体“中医陈雷”发过一个视频，称侯元祥是一个“制售假药的骗子”，呼吁公众冷静看待此案：“如果置事实于不顾，不是爱中医，是在害中医。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;视频发布后，“中医陈雷”即遭到侯元祥众多支持者的网络围攻，吴鹏飞更是连续发布8个短视频反驳。没过多久，“中医陈雷”那条视频就下架了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在网上看到侯元祥假药案后，南京圭石堂中医馆总经理钱辉决定出手声援。钱辉曾有过与侯元祥类似的经历。据媒体报道，钱辉没有医师执业证，为了规避“非法行医”，他的中医馆聘请正规医生给病人开方子，钱辉则会在一旁“指导”， 而医生开的药都是圭石堂根据自家“秘方”做的自制药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年底，圭石堂被人举报，由于未取得批号，其自制药被南京市药监局认定为假药，钱辉及圭石堂多名员工因涉嫌“生产、销售假药罪”，一度被警方刑事拘留，其中钱辉被关了28天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们为什么支持侯元祥无罪？主要原因是站在一个保护传统中医的角度，因为侯元祥的案子一旦是有罪判决，那么很多的传统中医就干不下去了。”钱辉对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在圭石堂“合伙人”之一龚飞云看来，传统中医就是“民间中医”，而侯元祥是众多“民间中医”的一个。他对“民间中医”这样定义：体制外中医的统称，没有进大学接受过正规中医药学教育，没有医师执业证。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年6月底，龚飞云曾赴青岛面见侯元祥。据龚飞云介绍，当时侯元祥虽已被警方“监视居住”，但当时管得还不严，他想办法将其约出来，并拍了视频。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“民间中医大学”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;龚飞云当年也曾参与圭石堂假药案的斡旋。据他透露，在该案办理期间，圭石堂曾与南京警方打了一场“舆论战”：先是南京一家媒体站在警方立场曝光该案，之后龚飞云联系了一家外地媒体，发出了圭石堂方面the sound of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终，该案停留在公安侦查阶段，没能进入检察院审查起诉环节。经此一劫的圭石堂，此后主打上海市场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在钱辉和龚飞云之前，另一位“民间中医”支持者管乐也在网上声援侯元祥。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;管乐自称是“民间中医大学首任校长”“长城铭刻人物”“世界中医堂联合会会长”。他将“民间中医大学”形容为民间中医的“黄埔军校”，不过，这所大学3年前就宣称要成立，但至今也没成立。管乐曾公开说，这所大学成立后，将评选“民间中医院士”“民间中医博士”“民间中医教授”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相关信息显示，2020年6月，成立“民间中医大学”的口号刚喊出，管乐就声称要开一个该大学某地分校的成立大会。而会议结束次日，管乐就在多个中医群发布了一个医疗培训班的广告，声称没有任何医学基础的人都可以当场学会，培训费为两天18000元（可优惠）。不料，此举连带“民间中医大学”，均遭到江苏一家三甲医院医生顾经宇的实名公开质疑，管乐回应说：“民间中医大学”是创新：“既然是创新，肯定就没有任何证，既然没证，那肯定就不合法……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;去青岛见完侯元祥后，龚飞云与管乐曾在上海会面，两人还一同拜访了华东政法大学一位支持民间中医的教授，并请其就侯元祥案发声。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月9日，管乐策划的第二届民间中医大学筹建预备会议在北京召开，曾为侯元祥案发声的钱辉、龚云飞、卫柏兴均参与了此次会议，会议期间专门讨论了侯元祥案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“（侯元祥案）等于把所有民间中医都团结起来了。”龚飞云对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥假药案二审裁定发回重审后，侯元祥的支持者们一片欢腾，纷纷在网上发布“喜讯”，认为该案出现“重大转机”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后不久，有自媒体又曝出一条新闻——侯元祥正在绝食，且消息“千真万确”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，吴鹏飞很快发短视频澄清，称侯元祥是由于身体虚弱吃不下饭，他的徒弟“因为害怕有人暗害侯老，故意对外发布绝食消息，以便引起全社会的关注&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数日后，吴鹏飞再发短视频，称“侯老”身体恢复，开始每顿“喝一点小酒”，而看管他的警员一天三顿都只能煮面条吃……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据二审律师李刚透露，二审发回重审后，因为“知道（侯元祥原监视居住地）的人太多”，警方给侯元祥换了一个地方执行监视居住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“我不再参与这个事情了”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;李诚（化名）是侯元祥一名吉林籍癌症患者的孙子，他自称在许多事情“都不知道”的情况下，也曾参与过为侯元祥“喊冤”的舆论战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年6月8日，侯元祥提起上诉后，一个微信名叫“流星与晚霞”的人加了李诚的微信，自称是“侯教授”的儿媳妇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“到时候您可以写联名信给侯教授求个情吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“侯教授怎么了？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“被别人举报了，现在在医院治疗，还吃不上自己的药。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李诚这才知道侯元祥出事，他告诉“流星与晚霞”，自己可以帮侯元祥写联名信。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两个月后，“流星与晚霞”把李诚拉进了一个支持侯元祥的癌症患者微信群。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李诚手机里存着一个标注为“李主任抗癌”的号码，这个号码是侯元祥给他的。他为爷爷买药，就是与这位“李主任”联系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在接到南方周末记者打来的电话之前，李诚一直以为，“李主任”叫“李建英”，是侯元祥所在医院药品方面的负责人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但实际上，“李主任”是侯元祥的儿子侯雷，“流星与晚霞”才是李建英，她也是侯家所有成年人当中惟一未涉案的一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据一审判决书，在侯元祥案中，侯元祥对外称“侯教授”，负责提供配方、诊疗癌症疾病、销售药品，女儿侯静负责诊疗癌症以外的疾病和销售药品、购进中草药、熬制中药药剂等，儿子侯雷则在后台冒充负责拿药、退药的医生“李主任”，也就是李建英。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加了“流星与晚霞”微信一个多月后，李诚与侯元祥也联系上了。 “他（侯元祥）说把我的信息放到网上去，我说行，只要对你那边的案情有帮助。”李诚说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李诚还建议侯元祥在自媒体平台讲一下这个事情，以提高关注度，“他说行，我让家里边去弄一下”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，侯元祥给李诚发了一些案件材料，让他帮忙联系媒体。此后就没了音讯。而李诚也没能帮侯元祥联系到媒体。一直到2023年7月下旬，他给侯元祥发信息，“他给我回了一句，说（二审）快开庭了，问题不大”。这是李诚最后一次与侯元祥联系。在此之前，侯家提出，把李诚的个人信息放到网上，作为侯元祥“治愈”癌症患者的案例之一，他同意了。然而，名单还没发到网上，李诚的爷爷就去世了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在得知真相后，李诚意识到事情“没那么简单”——“这些我都不知情，我根本就不知道。我只是作为一个病人家属，想着如果能帮忙的话就帮一下，但是前提必须要在法律的框架内……我不再参与这个事情了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[床虱危机或已蔓延至香港：为何太阳晒不倒，杀虫剂无效？丨硬核唠科]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260875]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[同性性行为进化的逻辑]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260881]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;同性之间的性行为因不能直接产生后代，长期以来被视为达尔文进化论的一个悖论. Because according to general understanding, in the natural world where the physical competition and the survival of the fittest, the same sexual behavior consumes valuable energy and time but cannot breed the offspring.自然界和人类社会中不乏存在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科学家已在超过1500种动物中发现了同性性行为，这样的行为不受性别影响，既可能发生在两个雄性之间也可能发生在两个雌性之间，既会出现在人工繁育的环境里，也会出现在野外，并非极端环境所迫之下的偶然行为。 This also raises a problem for scientists how to understand its evolutionary logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月，西班牙格拉纳达大学等机构的研究人员通过种系分析大量哺乳动物的同性性行为信息，尝试验证了一些相关解释性的假设。他们发表在《自然通讯》（Nature Communications）的最新研究表明，同性性行为的进化很可能就是一种适应大自然的行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;维持同性社会关系&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“同性性行为发生在许多哺乳动物物种中，包括我们的亲缘动物大型类人猿。相较于将其归为适应不良或异常的行为，我们的研究表明，哺乳动物的这种性行为是一种趋同适应，有助于维持社会关系并减少同性间的冲突。” 最新研究的主要作者、同时在西班牙干旱区实验站功能和进化生态学部和格拉纳达大学任教授的何塞·戈麦斯（José M. Gómez）告诉南方周末记者，同性性行为虽然在很多物种中都有出现，但在灵长类中尤其普遍，这可能正是因为灵长类动物比其他许多哺乳动物群体更具社会性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从数据上来看，研究共在260多种哺乳动物中发现同性性行为，在超过八成的案例中，其表现形式为爬背或者生殖器的接触，还有不到30%的物种甚至会通过求爱或配对等形式来表现同性性行为。从年龄上来看，同性性行为主要发生在成年期的哺乳动物中，只在10种动物中发现幼龄同性性行为。从环境上来看，超过八成的样本中同性性行为发生在野生或者半野生的环境。性别方面，同性性行为在哺乳动物两性中的分布是相对均衡的，160多种物种中记录有雌性同性性行为，190多种物种中有发现雄性同性性行为，合并起来，大概有一半的物种中同时有两种性别的同性性行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，最新研究只是根据现有的哺乳动物同性性行为记录展开分析，并不代表哺乳动物的全部情况。事实上，因为大自然中同性性行为的发现有赖于观察，而一些物种中雌性和雄性长得很像，甚至雌雄难辨，有科学家估计，目前对自然界同性性行为的记录应该是低估的。而且，相比哺乳动物，鸟类、爬行动物、鱼类、昆虫和其他无脊椎动物等，要么体积小，要么生活远离地面，观察起来各有难处，但都记录有同性性行为。因此，大自然中同性性行为的模式要远比哺乳动物中已经观察到的要复杂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前，不少假说将同性性行为理解为适应不良或行为异常，推测这种行为可能是性别认同错误、异性同类缺乏，或者异性性行为受挫等特定条件下的表现。从性行为发生场景来看，最新研究发现，同性性行为的发生并不一定需要极为特殊的场合。虽然有些物种中同性性行为很罕见，只能在极特殊情况下观察到，但对于研究中大约40%的哺乳动物来说，同性性行为在特定时间段称得上中高频的活动，在交配季节很容易观察到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;同性与异性并存&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;而且一些行为观察很早就表明，同性性行为在一些种群中可能起到积极的作用。比如，雄性宽吻海豚间的一些同性性行为或有助于加强小群体之间的联盟，雌性倭黑猩猩群体中的同性性行为可能促进成员之间的和解。不过，最新研究对种系的分析并不聚焦特定物种中同性性行为的机制，而是通过大规模的统计将同性性行为与社会行为联系起来。这一研究表明，同性性行为与许多其他通过自然选择进化而来的行为特征是相似的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何塞·戈麦斯教授提醒，这里同性性行为的意义应该放在进化生物学的框架里去理解，与当前人类社会对性别等相关问题的观点还是有所不同。因为在进化生物学的研究里，同性性行为是个体在某些时间段里的短暂行为，并非永久行为或者生活选择，他们同时也可能有异性性行为，因此，还不能直接与人类社会的相关行为作类比。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在人类社会，同性性行为相关的问题植根于各地不同的文化环境和历史传统，理解起来更为复杂。但近年来，区分人类同性性行为的讨论也已经引起科学家的关注，核心的关注点在于，发生过同性性行为的人究竟在多大程度上可以被界定为同性恋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年，哈佛大学等机构的研究人员在《科学》杂志（Science）曾发表一项大规模的基因研究，试图揭示同性性行为的基因特征，也就是所谓的“同性恋Gene&quot;.通过与英国生物银行和基因检测分析公司23andMe的合作，研究人员最终从数十万的基因样本中识别出多个与同性性行为相关的基因位点，表明“同性恋基因”与其他行为特征类似，也是多基因的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在2021年，包括印第安纳大学金赛研究所等性与性别研究机构的科学家对这项研究公开表达反对意见，认为其只通过是否发生过同性性行为来区分人，是将异性恋、双性恋和同性恋混为一谈，没有准确地衡量人们的性行为、性吸引力和性认同等，因而最终发现的基因特征可能并不能揭示同性性行为的倾向，而只是揭示出喜欢追求新鲜感的人格特质。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为在性学研究者看来，异性恋应该是一种持续性的性吸引模式，不能因为一个人曾发生过同性性行为就认定其不是异性恋。性学研究先驱阿尔弗雷德·金赛（Alfred Kinsey）更是很早就制定有量表来区分有过同性性行为的人，依据同性性行为的频率，人可以分成多个类型，而非同性恋或异性恋两种。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;或有助于繁殖&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;人类社会关于同性性行为与同性恋如何区分的争议，在一定程度上也反映出理解进化逻辑的一个难点。相比人类社会将“同性性行为”“同性恋”“没有后代”等概念高度绑定，同性性行为在漫长的进化历史中可能从来不意味着“没有后代”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“达尔文进化悖论应该放在一边了，它已经不存在了，因为在各种动物物种中，双性性行为的存在可以确保同性性行为不妨碍繁殖成功。”帝国理工学院生命科学系教授文森特·萨沃莱宁（Vincent Savolainen）告诉南方周末记者，围绕同性性行为存在很多概念，但从生物学的角度看，同性性行为和同性恋、双性恋等可能有一些相似的机制和进化逻辑，这是生物学家未来可以继续研究的。与此同时，心理学家也可以深入研究这种复杂行为的其他方面，比如性偏好等，从而可以更好地理解同性性行为的进化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从历史上对同性性行为的观点来看，进化逻辑之所以难以理解，关键还在于推测其适应成本过高，行为的代价太大。但包括最新研究在内，近年来已有多项研究表明，同性性行为在进化过程中并不意味着“断子绝孙”，而是可能以其他非直接的方式对繁育后代产生积极影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年，澳大利亚昆士兰大学心理和进化中心科学家布伦丹·齐奇（Brendan Zietsch）曾利用数十万样本的基因数据来模拟人类的进化，这里面也包含大量异性性伴侣的数据。而分析显示，在只有异性性行为的人群中，与同性性行为相关的遗传基因能同时让人们有更多的异性性伴侣，这意味着因此获得了性交配优势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;进一步分析显示，这背后也关联着开放性和冒险的人格特质。人格方面更具开放性的人会更愿意尝试新事物，也有更强的好奇心和想象力。研究人员推测同性性行为相关的基因在赋予人们同性性行为倾向的同时，也给与人们相关的人格特质，这使得有相关遗传基因的人在找异性伴侣方面更有优势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由此，虽然同性性行为本身不会产生后代，但相关的基因可以让人们获得生育后代的优势，从而导致同性性行为在漫长的进化中保留至今。不过，布伦丹·齐奇向南方周末记者强调，这一研究虽然有数据上的优势，但相关解释仍然是探索性质的，还需要更多研究来深入了解同性性行为相关的表现，以理解其进化的基础。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;灵长类的可遗传性&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;文森特·萨沃莱宁教授也曾开展过同性性行为方面的研究，得出过类似支持生育优势的结论. 2023年8月，他们通过对恒河猴三年详细观察数据的分析，发现恒河猴群落中的同性性行为很普遍，基本不受年龄或者群落结构等因素影响，也并没有给它们带来什么适应性代价，相反，同性性行为调节了同伴间的关系，提高了繁殖成功率。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相关研究发表在《自然生态与进化》（Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution），共观察了两百多只雄性恒河猴的社交和性行为。而结合几十年前的血统数据，研究表明，雄性恒河猴中同性性行为既是可重复的，也是可遗传的，遗传率为6.4%，这在人类之外，提供了灵长类同性性行为可遗传的第一个证据。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“恒河猴与人类共享超过70%的DNA，追溯到大约2500万年前的话，与我们也有共同的祖先。它们是生物医学研究中使用的主要非人灵长类动物，也是研究同性性行为等行为生态学问题的绝佳模型。然而，值得注意的是，恒河猴和人类之间还是存在差异的，我们希望通过研究解开这些错综复杂的谜团，发现根植于我们进化历史的共同的行为。”文森特·萨沃莱宁教授向南方周末记者解释，最新研究表明同性性行为可能是灵长类动物繁殖生态的一个共同的特点，对理解人类群体中的同性性行为有一定启发，但是受人类社会一些独特的社会因素影响，人类社会中的同性性行为确实有很大的代价。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“人类似乎是唯一表现出严格同性恋的物种。”文森特·萨沃莱宁教授说，文化因素会影响这一现象。例如在萨摩亚，一些男同性恋尽管自己没有后代，但他们实际在社会上承担了女性的角色，会帮助抚养亲戚的孩子。 “我希望我们的研究在培育更包容的文化方面能够发挥作用，在自然界和人类社会中都能包容性别多样性。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 22:25:23 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[网购二手“人脉”真的靠谱吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260873]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[不在职业资格目录中的“律师经纪人”，3860元拿证]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260871]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;不少有关合同纠纷的诉讼中出现了“律师经纪人”。（人民视觉供图）&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;可以肯定，律师经纪人应是辽宁省经纪人协会“创设”的工种。 The association recommends others as litigants in the name of social groups.但相关法律人士指出，辽宁省经纪人协会的操作，违反了有关法律规定，且国家职业资格目录中，也没有与“律师经纪”相关的职业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此事在法律界发酵之后，已有地方律协发出提示：律师履职时发现“律师经纪人”“法务经纪人”问题，应当向所在办案机关提出异议，切勿参与相关公司、机构的运行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;每代理一起案件，需向协会支付500元&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;过往的判例中，“律师经纪人”主要出现在保险纠纷、合同纠纷、民间借贷纠纷中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;沈阳市于洪区人民法院在2023年3月裁定的一起机动车交通事故责任纠纷中，肖某驾驶小客车与骑电动车闯红灯的杨某相撞，致杨某受伤。杨某随后起诉肖某和肖某投保的两家保险公司，要求共计25万元左右的各项赔偿。而杨某的两位诉讼代理人均为“律师经纪人”。最终，沈阳于洪区法院判保险公司一方支付12万元左右的赔偿款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在案号为（2022）辽14民终1093号的一起合同纠纷中，杨某与刘某签订了餐具厂转让协议，约定杨某分期支付17万转让款，但第一笔款项给付期限届满后，杨某未按约定支付。刘某遂起诉杨某要求履约并支付违约金，共计约20万元。杨某一审败诉，向葫芦岛市中院提起上诉，并委托一位“律师经纪人”担任自己的诉讼代理人。葫芦岛市中院未支持杨某的诉求，二审维持原判。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这些案件的相似点在于，代理案件的“律师经纪人”来自同一个社会组织：辽宁省经纪人协会律师经纪人专委会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;全国社会组织信用信息公开平台显示，辽宁省经纪人协会于2007年登记成立，其主管单位为辽宁省供销合作联合社，业务范围为指导全省经纪行业工作，组织开展经纪人业务培训，为经纪人提供法律、政策、信息咨询服务等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;律师经纪人专委会是辽宁省经纪人协会的下设机构，协会在《辽宁省经纪人资格证书的说明》中载明，拥有辽宁省经纪人资格证书即可解决代理诉讼资质问题：只需要一次缴纳3860元，经培训和考试就能取得证书，“没有法律基础也能过关”，此后即可在辽宁省内代理民事诉讼案件、从事出庭应诉等相关活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此外，取得经纪人资格证的人员每代理一起案件，需要向该协会支付500元以开具推荐函。此外，经纪人资格证每年都需年检，费用50元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;与公民代理有明显不同&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;律师经纪人事件发酵后，再次将公民代理置于聚光灯下。但辽宁省经纪人协会发起的律师经纪人代理案件，与正常的公民代理有明显区别。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在2012年民事诉讼法修正之前，法律允许3类公民可以代理民事诉讼案件：当事人的近亲属、有关的社会团体或者所在单位的人；当事人委托且经人民法院许可的其他公民。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;西南政法大学最高人民法院应用法学研究基地副主任吴志伟表示，公民代理服务质量较差、收费不规范，还容易滋生司法寻租、贿赂法官等问题，在2012年修改民事诉讼法时，删除了“法院许可的其他公民”，将公民作为委托诉讼代理人的范围限定为两类：当事人的近亲属或者工作人员；当事人所在社区、单位以及有关社会团体推荐的公民。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;对于社团推荐的进一步要求，见于最高人民法院关于适用民事诉讼法的解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;其中规定，有关社会团体推荐公民担任诉讼代理人的，社团应当为依法登记设立的非营利性法人。而被代理人应当为社团成员，或者当事人一方住所地是位于该社会团体的活动地域。此外，被推荐人还应该是社团的负责人或与社团有劳动关系的工作人员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;比照相关规定，吴志伟认为，严格来讲，辽宁省经纪人协会的行为，违反了司法解释第87条的规定，“这些人不具备代理法律事务的资格”，代理事务必须属于该社会团体章程载明的业务范围，经纪人协会的业务范围一般与经纪人有关，而从目前公开的裁判文书看，案件的被代理人并非是经纪人，“假如经纪人出现了相关民事纠纷，他们作为诉讼代理人，这才是符合规定的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;另一个问题是，社会团体能否提供有偿服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;早在1993年，司法部就发布过《关于公民个人未经批准不得从事有偿法律服务的批复》明文要求，这意味着公民代理不能收取报酬。依据相关规定，公民代理中的差旅费可以要求当事人报销。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但律师经纪人显然是收取费用的。 2023年11月14日，辽宁省内一起合同纠纷的判决结果在律师界流传：一位律师经纪人因在此前代理的离婚诉讼中未履行出庭义务遭委托方起诉，诉请返还5000元法律服务fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;辽宁省民政厅社会组织管理局于2023年3月22日发布的《社会组织开展法律服务活动提示单》中已提到，个别社会组织违法推荐公民代理诉讼，谋取不正当的经济利益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这份提示单提到，按照相关规定，涉法类社会组织严格实行登记管理机关和业务主管单位双重负责的管理体制。社会组织应当依照章程规定的宗旨和业务范围开展活动，不得从事营利性经营活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;不在国家职业资格目录中&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;尽管辽宁省经纪人协会已向多人发授律师经纪人资格证，但“律师经纪”这一职业并不在人社部2021年公布的《国家职业资格目录》中。该目录规定的职业资格均明确了实施部门或单位，并要求除此之外任何机构或者单位不得再自行设置实施职业资格。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年11月15日，南方周末记者就相关问题致电咨询辽宁省经纪人协会会长陈文成，其先表态称只能承接辽宁省内案件，后又表示，目前不直接做民事诉讼，也不做律师经纪人相关业务。截至发稿，该协会官网已无法正常显示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;11月16日，南方周末记者多次致电辽宁省司法厅，接线人员称对“律师经纪人”不了解，具体情况可咨询当地律协。南方周末记者多次致电辽宁省律师协会，截至发稿未获回复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据上游新闻报道，辽宁省民政厅相关工作人员回应称，对辽宁省经纪人协会的相关情况，将介入调查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年11月15日，北京市通州区律协发出提示，若律师履职时发现“律师经纪人”“法务经纪人”问题，应当向所在办案机关提出异议，切勿参与“法务经纪人”“律师经纪人”等相关公司、机构的运行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在辽宁省内，抚顺市民政局、铁岭市民政局等机构都已发出类似提示。 &lt;/p>;

Most of these photos were taken outdoors and the home as the background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我过去的作品中有90%拍摄于中国，那是中国经济高速发展和实现现代化、全球化的时期，我用这种特殊的摆拍方式来记录，真实的内部空间被短暂地呈露在外部空间中，结合当下环境的变更、城市的扩张、科技的发展、人们生活方式的改变，以静态的纪实制造出一个动态的社会图景. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2022年，我开始拍摄美国的家庭。家是组成社会的最小单元，许多这样的单元组成了整个社会，我继续用“家当”系列，来反映美国当代社会的内部结构和多元化。 I observed that the American family, regardless of urban and rural areas, the basic material living standards are not much different, so I pay more attention to showing their spiritual attributes. I have a long preparation time before shooting each work. I understand the story of the characters in advance, visit their rooms, think about the idea of ​​shooting, and carefully choose items used for display. The choice of family not only covers the native Americans, but also the immigrants who miss their hometown, which is the idea of ​​love, occupation, identity and gender and time.每个画面里的物品都经过了精心布置，用物质来反映精神生活，我将这些带有精神属性的物品进行空间挪移，并摆放在同一个画面里叠加，将平时司空见惯的场景进行视觉强化，突出这个家庭或个体在当下的生活状态、信仰和情感记忆，用一张照片勾勒出一个现实状态与精神世界的结合。读者可以很直接地通过照片和他们的故事产生思考。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;非常感谢那些愿意面对我的镜头，展示他们的家当以及分享他们故事的家庭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;惠特妮·詹森（Whitney Jensen） 2022年8月&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/cbb711c0c3.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/16/cbb711c0c3.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258478&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;惠特妮·詹森（Whitney Jensen）2022年8月&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;惠特妮·詹森，36岁。 She is a very cheerful and enthusiastic woman.

Sino -new relations were promoted to a comprehensive and high -quality forward -looking partnership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在中新合作再上一个台阶的契机下，南方周末研究员在新加坡采访了南洋理工大学协理副校长刘宏教授。 As alumni of Xiamen University and Fudan University, Liu Hong has studied and worked in many countries in Asia, North America, and Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘宏表示，在过去十多年，他从教学、研究和管理工作中注意到，中国和新加坡的关系正呈现出全方位、与时俱进和高质量几个特点.从早期的中国向新加坡学习，已改变成双向的互相学习、互相借鉴的趋势。随着中新关系进入新的发展阶段，南洋理工大学也在不断提升合作项目的水准，从深度和广度方面，进一步推动新加坡和中国的友好和合作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;刘宏&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/cac4375609.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1544&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/cac4375609.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258735&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;刘宏&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;娄晓希摄&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;到中国去，百闻不如一见&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你在世界多个国家的高校学习和工作过，感觉中国学生和其他国家的学生相比有什么特点？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘宏：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;中国大陆的学生总的特点是非常勤奋好学。每年毕业的大学生超过1000万，竞争非常大。 Among college students in various countries I have contacted, Chinese students can be said to be a leading degree.这一方面是因为中华民族具有热爱学习的传统，但另一方面也是因为社会竞争越来越激烈，所以大家都要脱颖而出。 College students&#39; employment is a big challenge. Chinese students are very concerned about the development of the world, and they also have a strong willingness to study abroad.我本人在荷兰和美国留学，然后在新加坡、英国工作，在日本京都大学和大阪大学待了快两年时间，有较多切身感受。 I think the characteristics of Chinese students&#39; diligence and learning are very obvious. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你认为东西方高等教育体系有什么不Same? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘宏：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我在荷兰学习了一年多、在美国留学也有五年多时间。西方国家有对知识追求的传统，它并不是以考试成绩作为主要的目标，而是一个比较发散型的、比较多元的目标。学生根据自己的兴趣来选一些科目，所以会多元化、多角度地来看一些问题，但是我觉得西方教育有一个较大的缺陷——对包括中国在内的发展中国家的了解比较欠缺。最近有学者分析，在2010年代的国际政治经济学的教科书和相关论文里，有关中国的比例不到只占11%，是很小的比例；但中国现在已经是全世界第二大的经济体，它的GDP总量已经接近世界的20%左右，可见大学教材中有关中国的知识十分缺乏。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如何通过教育让西方更好地了解中国? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘宏：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我在英国任职期间，曾组织好几次来自全英不同高校的数百名大学生到中国做两周至三周的游学和浸濡，我把这个项目取名为“体验动感中国”(Experience a Dynamic China)。很多英国人对中国的了解很缺乏，也很过时，而且大都是书本上看到的。通过我们组织他们到北京、上海、南京、广州、济南这些不同的城市，到不同的地方（包括农村），让他们感受到一个不断变化和发展中的中国。我觉得，在国际教育和交流中，我们可以有更多的中国故事，有更多中国声音。其中的一个来源是让外国人士自己来感受。我从这些浸濡活动的参与者所得到的反馈是，很多人回去之后，都讲到对中国的印象几乎发生了翻天覆地的变化，百闻不如一见。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;科研成果落地大湾区&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;南洋理工大学在粤港澳大湾区如何推动中新教育领域的合作？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘宏：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;大湾区现在是中国发展最具有潜力的一个地区。新加坡和中国合作建立了中新广州知识城，我们大学跟知识城、华南理工大学共同成立了中新国际联合研究院，进展非常好。除了产学研结合之外，知识城还安排一些政府官员到我们这里来培训。我自己目前在主持由广州市开发区和中新知识城委托的营商环境改进和提升的调研项目。我们希望，讲到中国的发展并不是纸上谈兵，而是对中国最新的发展有一个了解，然后把中国的发展跟世界的发展连在一起。在这个过程里，新加坡能够提供哪些有益的经验？又怎样共同进步？其实，我们项目的宗旨是推动新加坡和中国、东盟和中国的友好关系，这个大目标是我和我的同事共同努力的方向。这也是南洋理工大学新任校长何德华教授最近提出打造“南洋理工大学新加坡-中国知识枢纽”的主要目标。不管是新加坡政府还是南洋理工大学，都非常关注和重视大湾区的发展，比如我刚才讲到的中新广州知识城，它已成为中新两国之间的国家级项目之后，依托并得益于大湾区迅速发展的大背景。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;作为南洋理工大学协理副校长，对未来合作有哪些规划？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘宏：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;不管是在广州、香港，还是深圳，现在和未来我们都有很多的合作，这些合作不仅仅注重于人才的培养，我们也特别注重产学研结合。新中关系更多的是相互学习、相互借鉴，与时俱进的关系。我们主要目的是把世界各地特别是新加坡的最新科研成果，转化到大湾区这块肥沃的土壤上，并使之生根发芽并且推广。这也是为什么我们在广州设立国际联合研究院，也是为什么与深圳的合作中，很注重的一点就是创新。新加坡和深圳把合作建立智慧城市、数字经济这一系列新发展作为重点。深圳在创新方面引领的不仅仅是中国，也是引领世界。我们一直跟大湾区的高校有很多的合作。跟香港的高校在进行学生交流、科研合作，也会进一步深化。今后我们南洋公共管理研究生院可能会在广州和深圳等地进一步加大人才培养的力度。深圳越来越关注东盟，东盟当然也可以借助深圳或者广东的平台来进一步发展。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在公共治理领域方面，新加坡和中国有哪些可相互借鉴的经验？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘宏：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我们的研究特别关注亚洲公共治理。现在，整个全球公共治理的一些理论、经验和模式，主要是建立在西方经验的基础上。我们希望通过深入分析新加坡、中国的发展和东盟其他国家的发展模式，来探索这些国家的经验，并分析它们对全球公共治理理论和实践有哪些帮助。我们有不少的研究项目，包括关注“一带一路”作为跨界治理的新模式，关注亚洲国家和非洲国家之间的互相学习和借鉴，也包括在“一带一路”的背景下，中国企业“走出去”以及和其他国家合作的不同模式，这是我本人以及我们学院的几个研究重点。我们希望未来继续跟中国政府、国企或者高校保持密切联系。随着中新关系进入新的发展阶段，我们也在不断地提升项目的水准，从深度和广度方面进一步推动新加坡和中国的友好合作。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;文明对话的精髓&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你怎么看待“一带一路”倡议？未来发展的重点方向是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘宏：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;今年是“一带一路”倡议提出10周年，是一个非常重要的发展里程碑。在过去这几个月，我应邀做了不下10次有关“一带一路”的演讲。看得出来，世界不同的国家，对“一带一路”都很关注，虽然它们的出发点有所不同。 “一带一路”倡议中的“五通”包括了民心相通和政策沟通，这也是我们学院及我本人都非常关注的两个方面。我把“五通”里面的民心相通和政策沟通看作一个软件；基础设施建设、贸易、投资这些是硬件，硬件跟软件要有机地结合，才能够发挥最好的作用。未来的发展，我们一方面要思考怎样在这10年取得的成就基础上，进一步提升“一带一路”项目的质量和影响力，包括注重数字经济、绿色发展、公共卫生这一系列的课题，这些会成为“一带一路”未来发展的重点。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在青年一代在中国文化“走出去”方面，可发挥什么作用？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘宏：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;中国文化“走出去”进行文明对话，需要我们进一步展开。在这个过程里，来自中国的年轻人，还有中国的国企，中国的科研人员、高校教师等等，都扮演了重要角色。我觉得，未来发展上，把握好中国文化发展的自身精髓很重要，包括中国文化传统的一些特点：守正不守旧，尊古不复古。首先要了解自己的文化，有自己文化的根，然后与其他的文化展开对话。其次，还是要以平等、包容、开放、尊重的心态来看待其他的文化。在文化方面，每一个国家的文化都有它自身的特点和优点，都是在不同国家自身环境下的产物，我们应该本着理解和尊重的态度，不能说这个事情中国这样做，你为什么不this way?只有理解和交流才能够真正地做到文化“走出去”。第三，还是要注重创新，不管中国文化也好，其他国家文化也好，都要反映新时代的发展特点，包括我们现在所处的第四次工业革命，全球化和逆全球化并行的时代，全球地缘政治也发生了很多的变化。在这样的情况下，应该看中国文化、世界文化的种创造性的转型，实现更有效的对话。中国政府提出的“全球发展倡议”和“全球文明倡议”，给世界的发展提供了中国智慧。中国智慧有非常深厚的内涵，但是在沟通和交流的方式上，我们还有更多的努力空间，让世界各国了解中华文化的精髓。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一中学发生拥挤踩踏事件：改善硬件设施与提高管理水平当双管齐下丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260863]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;一起校园意外伤亡事件牵动人心。 2023年11月14日，河南省武陟县人民政府通报了当地中学的一起伤亡事件：11月13日上午10时许，武陟县兴华中学初一初二部分男生在期中考试间隙如厕时，因上下楼梯发生拥挤摔倒受伤，涉及的学生第一时间送往医院接受检查治疗。 At present, a student has died after full rescue. One student is heavier. The students are being treated with all their strength. Four students who are suffered by minor injuries can be hospitalized and can be discharged recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另据《新京报》报道，知情人士透露的事件细节是“兴华中学的厕所是上下两层，男厕所要走楼梯上去，楼梯栏杆都是完好的，不知道怎么就发生了踩踏”。而据网传学校图片，事发学校教学楼没有厕所，学生需要先下教学楼，再走楼梯上楼如厕，悲剧也是在上下楼时发生的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事故发生之后，全国各地多所学校要求课间各楼层安排值班教师。有媒体呼吁应当增加“课间时间”或是“考间时间”，让学生拥有更多的时间从容如厕，也有网友认为学校理应改善硬件设施，在教学楼每层都设置厕所。除了这些明面上的问题，这起事故就责任分配、预防措施而言，仍然值得辨析。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先就是事故性质。媒体报道都将这起事故报道为“踩踏事件”，但通报中的用词是“拥挤摔倒”。那么，事故的性质究竟是什么？这是值得深入调查的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果“知情人士”所说的“楼梯栏杆完好”、网友透露的“厕所在另一座楼”的情况属实的话，那么事故情况可能就是在考试间隙的十分钟里，大量学生先下教学楼，再去隔壁“厕所楼”，高密度人流在上下楼梯的过程中发生拥挤跌倒，最终酿就了这起一死五伤的悲剧。不幸离世的学生当死于下述几种可能性之一，一是源于高密度人群的挤压性窒息，二是重力原因导致的高处坠落，三是拥挤跌倒之后被踩踏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次则是事故成因与责任归属的问题。事故发生之后，厕所数量不够、考试间隙时间不足，是网友认定的两大客观成因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一场期中考试往往耗时在两个小时左右，至少是平常一节课时长的三倍，这将大大提高如厕频率。考生更需要在考试间隙如厕放松，无疑也会进一步提高如厕频率。如果把考生心理压力更大、来往厕所更为匆忙慌张的因素加上的话，多个变量的叠加足以放大安全风险：共同的两小时考试时间，相通的紧张心情，这拉高了群体同频共振的发生概率，也就增加了意外发生的几率。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;学校的硬件设施在事发当天已经无可更改，考试时间与考间时间也已确定。那么，当天的监考老师能做的恐怕就只有不准学生出去上厕所，才能百分之百杜绝这起事故的任何可能。应当追问的是，究竟是哪些人制定了这些规则？又是哪些人造就了如此之差的硬件设施？这才是应当为之负责的责任主体，而不是事发当天只是执行规则的监考老师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再次，如何预防同类事故再次发生？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国内类似的意外事故并非头一次发生。在2017年3月河南濮阳第三实验小学的踩踏事故中，学生在早读结束之后“洪水一样往下冲”；而在2000年11月河南许昌某中学的踩踏事故中，学生是在晚自习下课之后出事。全国各地的同类事故也已多次发生，这些事故的成因也都大同小异：课间时间较短，或是课时持续时间过长，下课铃一响学生就集中去厕所或是出门，因为拥堵导致踩踏. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，控制变量，对症下药，才能找到预防此类事故的解方。学校严格依照《中小学设计规范》加装厕所当然有其必要，在学校人流密集的出入口加装分流障碍物也是一个办法。而在大型活动比如考试、运动会、校庆进行期间，学校安排专人保证人流秩序、实行错峰管理，也是不可或缺的举措。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在提升硬件设施之外，学校也应着力于改善软件也就是管理水平。具体到这起事故，还应追问的是，当天学校有没有安排错峰考试，有没有专人负责维持人流的秩序？说得再细致一些，事发当天在考试进行中时，学校是否允许考生如厕？这也将缓解考试间隙的如厕压力。以及，学校在平时有没有做好防拥挤防踩踏的安全知识教育，有没有做过相应安全演习？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再好的硬件设施也有核定承载人数，其冗余度也有一个极限值，不能指望多修厕所、拓宽教学楼容积、加装分流障碍物就可以万事大吉，否则的话那些设施完善的大型旅游景点就不会发生踩踏事故了。可长可久的科学管理之道，方是防患于未然的最佳保证，其重要性绝不在提升硬件设施之下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，学校也不能因为发生了此类事件，而把学生关在教室里，不能把临时性的“在课间各楼层安排值班教师”永久化，那样恐怕还增大了教师的非教学负担，进入“学校应对学生负有无限安全责任”的误区。学校改善管理，还可思考更多地放权，给学生更多出教室、出教学楼、出操场的自由，让学生锻炼应对风险的能力，学会自我保护。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
