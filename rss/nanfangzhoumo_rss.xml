Although the public officials involved have been detained by the police and may be subject to disciplinary action thereafter, the reflection on this incident cannot stop there. The top priority is for local governments to strictly protect the interests of foreign agricultural investors in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 21, a video shot by a drone spread online. In the video, a man wearing a hat and plainclothes is cutting sorghum ears with scissors, while a uniformed man stands not far away and watches. After discovering that they had been photographed, the two walked towards a parked vehicle nearby. The man wearing a hat put the bucket containing sorghum ears into the trunk of a family SUV and walked towards a car in front of him with the word &quot;Patrol&quot; painted on it and equipped with police lights. car. The men in uniform got into the family SUV and started the vehicle. The poster of the video questioned that law enforcement officers from Sanhejian Town drove people to steal sorghum in patrol cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the video attracted attention, Sanhejian Town government propaganda staff said in an interview with the media on October 22 that the uniformed person in the video was indeed a public official of the town, but he did not participate in pinching sorghum. He was filmed while patrolling to &quot;stop&quot; people from picking sorghum, which caused a &quot;misunderstanding.&quot; The publicist also said that in order to eliminate everyone&#39;s doubts, the public security organs have intervened in the investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public security agency’s investigation results quickly slapped the propagandist in the face. A notice issued by the Sanhejian Town Government on the evening of the 22nd showed that after police investigation and verification, the uniformed person in the video was Yin Moumou, a staff member of the Sanhejian Town Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Brigade, and the other person was Zhang Moumou, a villager of Sanhuai Village. The two went to Gaoliang. The thieves cut sorghum ears on the ground; the two have been administratively detained by the police. Next, the Sanhejian Town Discipline Inspection Commission will seriously hold the party members and cadres involved accountable and deal with them in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public officials who are supposed to patrol to stop sorghum theft, drive patrol cars and lead people to cut sorghum and participate in the theft. It is really magical. What&#39;s even more magical is that after the incident was revealed, local officials immediately defended &quot;their own people&quot;, claiming that public officials were not involved in the theft, but to stop theft by the masses. If it hadn&#39;t been later verified by the police, many netizens might have truly believed this statement: Look, the person who stole the sorghum cuttings walked to the patrol car and was about to be taken back for questioning. The law enforcement officers drove away the car that stole the cuttings. There is absolutely nothing wrong with bringing back stolen goods, crime tools, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, they are not just facing netizens. Because the sorghum they stole was not ordinary sorghum. That is the local raw material production base of Moutai Group. As one of the most well-known brewing companies in China, Moutai Group has a high influence. In order to ensure the supply of brewing raw materials, Moutai Group has established raw material production bases in many places, and Gushi County in Henan is one of them. No matter where Moutai Group builds its raw material base, it will undoubtedly receive great attention from the local government. The Gushi County Government has set up a special Moutai organic raw material base construction office, which shows that the local government attaches great importance to this matter. Therefore, when the theft of sorghum cuttings attracted attention on the Internet, the local government would not dare to fool them. The public official literally hit the steel plate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, even for agricultural projects that the local government attaches great importance to, public officials dare to participate in theft, which shows that theft of crops is common in the local area. Some netizens said that many local farmers have a large amount of sorghum drying in front of their homes, but they do not grow sorghum themselves. So where does the sorghum come from? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant information released by Moutai Group, Moutai uses a specialized sorghum variety &quot;Hongyingzi&quot; for brewing. In Renhuai, Guizhou and other places, Moutai Group has purchased Hongyingzi sorghum at a protective price and will acquire it in 2022. The price is as high as 11.2 yuan/kg, much higher than the price of ordinary sorghum on the market. The sorghum grown at the Moutai raw material base in Gushi County is claimed to be organic sorghum, and its purchase price may be higher. Perhaps each thief may not steal too much, but if many people steal, it will cause huge losses to the growers. Perhaps this is why sorghum farming companies have to use drone patrols to detect and stop thieves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is a common problem faced by foreign agricultural investors. Just a few days ago, news broke out in Dancheng, Henan, that hundreds of farmers were robbing corn. News about people stealing peanuts, pumpkins, watermelons, and fish and shrimps emerged one after another across the country. These incidents all have one thing in common. Most of the people who steal things are local farmers, while those who are stolen are mostly people who transfer land for agricultural investment. Of course, there are also people who return to their hometowns to start agricultural businesses, and they are also stolen. After the incident, the local government often excused the local farmers by saying they were &quot;picking up&quot; crops that their owners had missed and discarded. But in fact, these so-called &quot;pickings&quot; often occur when growers are in the process of harvesting. The owner&#39;s harvesting machinery was still working, and the &quot;picker&quot; ran in front of the machine. Is there such a &quot;picker&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Allowing farmers to steal crops will not only harm the interests of investors, but may also cause serious injuries. Recently, there have been many incidents in which farmers were seriously injured or even killed by large harvesting machinery while &quot;picking up&quot; crops. Propaganda staff from Sanhejian Town in Gushi County also said in response to the media that patrols were organized considering that it might be unsafe for people to pick up sorghum during the sorghum harvest. As for the losses caused to growers by farmers stealing sorghum, the propagandist did not seem to care too much, &quot;Rural people just love to take advantage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is not a trivial matter that some farmers &quot;love to take advantage&quot;. The local government&#39;s &quot;harmony&quot; excuse for local farmers instead of safeguarding the interests of agricultural investors in accordance with the law undoubtedly embolden the thieves and makes agricultural investors feel disappointed. If things continue like this, who will dare to invest? Farmers who steal crops shall be subject to public security penalties and criminal penalties. Only in this way can this trend be stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, an urban management law enforcement team member from Sanhejian Town, Gushi County was arrested for stealing sorghum. He hit a large steel plate. The interests of small agricultural entrepreneurs should also be protected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[神舟十七号载人飞船发射取得圆满成功]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259342]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 11:46:35&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/26/451b72081ad4d31f5e60b2323543aa71.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;1104&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/26/451b72081ad4d31f5e60b2323543aa71.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255595&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the China Manned Space Engineering Office, the Shenzhou 17 manned spacecraft successfully separated from the rocket and entered the predetermined orbit.

In the parent group Various analyzes and discussions. Because Beijing recently issued a new high school entrance examination plan, which will be applicable to students in eighth grade (second grade) this year. The main change is to move the primary four subjects of history, geography, chemistry, and biology out of the examination subjects. They will no longer be counted in the total score of the high school entrance examination. They will be changed into examination subjects, divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. &quot;The results will be used for graduation.&quot; , for reference in further studies.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, the entrance exams (selective exams) and graduation exams (passing exams) for middle and high schools were separated. The former is the well-known high school entrance examination and college entrance examination. The scores of each subject are counted into the total score. High schools or universities are admitted from high to low according to the total score. The latter is called the Huikao, with passing scores (100 points for the paper-based test and 60 points for the paper-based test). Pass), if you pass the national examination in all subjects, you will obtain a junior high school or high school diploma. The HKCEE in the past was equivalent to the &quot;Academic Proficiency Examination&quot; today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now Beijing&#39;s Primary 4 Course of History, Geography, Biochemistry has been changed to grade-based grades. In essence, this Primary 4 subject has been changed from a selective subject in the high school entrance examination to a subject of a general examination nature. That&#39;s why &quot;the results are used for graduation&quot; &quot; said. As for &quot;use for reference in further studies&quot;, is it left to the high school to decide whether to use it or not, or is it to be used when two candidates have the same total score in the high school entrance examination, and there is no clear statement yet about who has a higher level than the primary four subjects. . The subjects that are still included in the total score of the high school entrance examination include: Morality and Rule of Law, Chinese, Mathematics, Foreign Languages, Physics, Physical Education and Health, a total of 6 subjects, of which Morality and Rule of Law will be changed to open-book examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some parents think this change is good: there are fewer subjects that require high school entrance examinations, and the academic burden on their children is also reduced. This view needs to be looked at in two ways: If parents are not obsessed with their children entering a good high school, that is naturally correct; if parents still want their children to go to a prestigious school, then in the context of a 50-50 split, merit selection It is still inevitable that students will compete for the total score of the remaining six subjects. In order to increase the degree of differentiation, the difficulty of the questions in these six high school entrance examination subjects may be increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other parents disagree and believe that when there are many subjects, if the child cannot learn well in one or two subjects, it can be remedied and he can learn other subjects well. However, now the number of subjects in the high school entrance examination has been reduced. With four doors, there is no room for such remediation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latter believes that kicking the primary school students out of the high school entrance examination will be detrimental to Puwa, who has average qualifications. A netizen said that his distant cousin just took the high school entrance examination in Beijing this year and scored more than 80 points in the math test. She relied on the primary four subjects to get close to the perfect score to bring her total score up, and she was admitted to a city key point. But now this document has Come on, after 2025, children like her will basically have no chance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This view actually makes sense. For subjects like mathematics and physics, even if students memorize every definition, theorem and even every page in the book, it will not help if they do not understand the meaning and connotation. Ultimately, these subjects examine students’ logical thinking (abstract thinking) and pattern (structure, regularity) recognition abilities, which are the core of general intelligence. If you are not talented in this area, relying on experienced teachers to make up lessons may not necessarily have significant results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, in the primary four subjects of history, geography, biochemistry, history is classified as a liberal arts subject, and geography, biology, and chemistry are regarded as science subjects, but the latter are generally regarded as &quot;liberal subjects among science subjects&quot;, especially in junior high schools. At this stage, this Primary 4 exam mainly tests students&#39; memorization. Students with good memory or sufficient diligence will be able to pass the test perfectly and get high scores. Considering that merit-based examinations such as the high school entrance examination and the college entrance examination rank and select students&#39; intelligence and abilities, let subjects such as physics and mathematics remain within the scope of the high school entrance examination, and put Primary 4 subjects within the scope of the passing/standard examination. , is understandable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing wrote in the basic principles of the new high school entrance examination plan: &quot;Cultivate students&#39; scientific spirit, promote the training and selection of talents in basic subjects, and better utilize the role of examination enrollment in improving the quality of the people and serving the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education. &quot;It is a basic requirement for a &quot;qualified&quot; merit-based selection examination to allow students with outstanding talents and curiosity to explore the truth to stand out instead of being buried in a pile of high scores without distinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are also issues worthy of discussion. For example, starting from 2025, Beijing will continue to include sports in the merit-based high school entrance examination, and the score will be increased from 40 points to 70 points. The Beijing Physical Education High School Entrance Examination in 2022 will be changed to a qualifying examination, and reaching the standard will mean full marks, which is a good attempt. Because athletic talent, like intellectual talent, is mainly innate. Sports schools want to select talents with athletic talent, and it is appropriate to conduct relevant merit-based examinations; if they want to go to high school, it is appropriate to conduct passing/standard examinations like Primary 4, otherwise it will affect the &quot;promotion of The goal of &quot;training and selecting talents in basic disciplines&quot; constitutes significant interference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most athletically gifted people and the most intellectually gifted people do not overlap very much. The two kinds of merit-based selection combined will lead to the following: the most athletically gifted and most intelligent people are likely not to go to the best high schools. On the contrary, one type of people will have an advantage: they are not the most outstanding in both talents but The combination is better, the family background is good, the parents are willing to invest, and the individual is willing to work hard. Changing sports to standard examinations can solve this problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many media have reported on &quot;junior high school students in the gym.&quot; Parents apply for gym memberships for them and hire private teachers to give them one-on-one tutoring at a cost of several hundred yuan per hour, so that they can strive for the highest possible scores in the physical education high school entrance examination. This is already contrary to the original intention of sports to strengthen the body, and over-training of developing children in adolescence is counterproductive to physical health. There are many cases of knee wear and sports injuries among junior high school students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing’s high school entrance examination is often regarded as a benchmark. How it is modified may have an impact on the reform of high school entrance examinations in other places. Therefore, it is normal for everyone to be concerned, analyze and discuss a lot. How to take the test will determine how to teach and how to learn. How can the test and teaching truly match the original goals? This is worthy of continuous exploration and reflection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[有人怕狗，有人爱狗，“宠物友好”空间能否消除对立？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259318]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pet Friendly 2&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/25/4877343745.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /10/25/4877343745.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255531&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot; >;March 11, 2023, Shanghai Xuhui Riverside, there are many pet-friendly spaces here, and it is regarded as a dog walking paradise by many &quot;poop scrapers&quot;.

The police have opened a case for investigation and taken criminal coercive measures against the dog owner Tang Mou in accordance with the law. On October 23, according to Xinhua News Agency, the injured girl had been transferred out of the ICU and her vital signs were currently stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a mother, Luo Youyou is very sad to see such news. When her daughter was under one year old, she was also besieged by pet dogs in the community. She was thankful that her daughter was not injured at the time, and since then she has not dared to &quot;walk her baby&quot; alone in the community. After having a daughter, Luo Youyou discovered that the places for walking babies and walking dogs in the city were highly overlapped. When pushing a stroller into the green space around the community, she often encountered dogs that were not on leashes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The habits of dogs determine that they need space to release energy and appropriate contact with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to alleviate the conflict between people and pets, in recent years, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu and other cities have begun to build &quot;pet-friendly&quot; shopping malls, hotels, parks... allowing pets to enter with conditions, and providing carts, elevators, and toilets. and other “pet-only” facilities and services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Opening public spaces is the first step to be pet-friendly, but more importantly, respect and understand the needs of pets: pet owners should walk their dogs in a civilized manner; dog lovers should not tease dogs easily; and ensure the safety of people who are afraid of dogs.

In major domestic tourist cities, she found that few hotels allow pets.

Feng Yun found that &quot;most parks are still closed to dogs, and Lucky rarely has the opportunity to run free. Living in the city has restricted his nature.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, pet-friendly spaces are not complicated. Zhang Jingyuan, an assistant professor at the School of Architecture of Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), suggested that it can be carried out around the four levels of food, water, sanitation and activity space, paying attention to the separation of humans and dogs and the isolation of large, medium and small breeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Ling, a professor at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning of Chongqing University, believes that when community space is limited, an area of ​​3-4 square meters can be appropriately divided to build a fence for pets to &quot;have fun&quot;. &quot;The key to a pet-specific activity space is &#39;having&#39; rather than &#39;big&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Allowing pets to enter is only the first friendly step&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Allowing pets to enter&quot; is only the first step For a space that advertises itself as &quot;pet-friendly&quot;, there is also a question mark as to whether its regulations can be strictly followed and truly &quot;pet-friendly&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member of the AI ​​PLAZA West Bund Fengchao Marketing Department told Southern Weekend reporters that a customer who entered the mall’s pet-friendly restaurant to dine did not put their pet in a cart but on a dining chair. Later, we received complaints from some customers: &quot;You gave people back the chairs that dogs had sat on.&quot; Walking dogs in shopping malls requires the correct use of pet strollers, but there are still a few customers who habitually let their dogs walk. When mall security comes to stop them, sometimes there will be disputes, &quot;Since it is a pet-friendly shopping mall, why can&#39;t you walk dogs?&quot; “Some customers don’t even have leashes and let their dogs roam around the mall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member said that complying with the pet-friendly regulations of shopping malls mainly depends on the customer&#39;s consciousness. The mall can only provide reminders and suggestions. Fortunately, most customers can adjust their behavior in time after being reminded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is currently no unified standard for pet-friendly spaces. Southern Weekend reporters consulted as consumers and found that the requirements of different hotels vary greatly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Guangzhou only allows non-venomous dogs under 10 kilograms and a shoulder height of less than 40 centimeters to stay, and it is not mandatory to check pet IDs. Hyatt Regency Beijing Wangjing allows dogs under 30 kilograms to stay, and there are no breed requirements. Dog licenses and vaccination certificates must be brought when checking in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before taking her Bichon Frize on a trip, Liu Doudou used to use travel software to filter for &quot;pet-friendly&quot; hotels. Since each hotel has different requirements, she would call the hotel to confirm again before placing the order. Some hotels were labeled as pet-friendly, but after learning that Liu Doudou was traveling with a Bichon Frize, they refused to accept guests on the grounds that “Bichon Frize Frize Frize Frize Frize Dogs shed hair.” “In fact, Bichon Frize Frize Frize Frize Dogs do not shed easily unless they are combed.

Wang Zijia, the professional planning manager of Jianfa Bay Yue City and the person in charge of the pet-friendly project, told Southern Weekend reporters that the Pet Activity Festival held in March 2023 will double the passenger flow to the mall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pet-related activities attract customers, but the professionalism of some activities needs to be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Qi discovered that five or six years ago, the &quot;Pet Big Eater Competition&quot; was popular in shopping malls in first-tier cities in China, where they competed to see who could finish dog food faster. The activity is very popular with dog food manufacturers, but it ignores the damage to the dog&#39;s body. If a dog participates in running and jumping activities after overeating, there is a risk of gastric torsion, which may be life-threatening in severe cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At present, pet eating competitions have basically disappeared, but many pet-friendly businesses still like to hold pet obstacle competitions. The appearance of pets trying to pass through the obstacles can make people laugh, but for pet dogs that have not been professionally trained , the owner’s forceful tugging will only keep them in a state of shock throughout the process,” Wu Qi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Regard pets as equal beings&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When I met a cute pet dog on the road, I couldn’t help but stare into its eyes and touch its head. You think you are showing kindness to your dog, but the feedback you receive may be aggression from the dog, even if it is a breed known for its docility. Because in unfamiliar situations, the behavior of touching the head and looking directly at the dog can easily be interpreted as hostility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be truly pet-friendly, hardware facilities are not enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Ling told Southern Weekend reporters that the premise of creating a pet-friendly space is to conceptually regard pets as equal living individuals that are dependent on humans, and their behavioral habits should be systematically studied. Fully understand and respect their daily needs. Taking the &quot;unity, health and peaceful coexistence&quot; of humans, animals and the environment as the basic principle for creating urban public spaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data released by the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention show that from January to August 2023, the number of people exposed to dog injuries in the city reached 149,000, due to licking, scratching or bites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Qi believes that the problem of human-canine conflict does not lie with dogs, but with people. For dog owners, dogs need to be socialized. Pet dogs that are unfriendly to people or even behave aggressively often have not been socialized and have not received good etiquette education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called socialization training means that during the golden period of 2-4 months of dog age, it is fully exposed to different environments, familiar with different spaces, smells and people, so as to adapt to urban life. &quot;Dogs that have missed the best period of socialization and haven&#39;t gone out for a long time are afraid of the outside world. Even a docile Labrador may bite people.&quot; Wu Qi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Liu Doudou travels with his pet, he always carries the dog&#39;s water bowl, food bowl, food plate and sleeping mat with him. After long-term dog walking and education, the nearly two-year-old Bichon Frize has maintained good hygiene habits and has never peed indoors or soiled the facilities in the hotel room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When walking his dog in the community, Liu Doudou kept the leash on him the whole time. &quot;In places with many people and cars, the leash is also for the safety of the puppy.&quot; When encountering pet dogs without leashes, she would sometimes argue with their owners. “Dogs tend to fight with each other, but some owners don’t take it seriously. They also say that their dogs never bite. If you have a puppy, you should treat a puppy well.” You must be responsible for life to the end, you must protect and guide, and you must also prevent puppies from hurting people.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jingyuan believes that pet-friendliness is a progressive process that extends from pet owners to commercial institutions, non-profit organizations and even government agencies, gradually affecting the public and forming a social consensus. The stigma against pets and stray cats and dogs mainly comes from fear of the unknown, and eliminating fear must rely on extensive science popularization and public participation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, her daughter, who has just turned one year old, still likes to get close to puppies on the roadside. Luo Youyou neither wants her to be as afraid of dogs as she is, but also does not dare to let her have direct contact with dogs. Wu Qi said that dogs that have been well socialized are safe in contact with children, but they also need guidance from parents. With the consent of the dog owner, let the child keep a certain distance from the dog first, gradually transition from visual contact to close contact, and provide buffer time for the animal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Respect and love are the prerequisites for urban inclusiveness. More and more cities are building child-friendly, disabled-friendly, and elderly-friendly facilities, and promoting ‘pet-friendly’ on the basis of achieving ‘human-friendly’ &#39;, it is also a reflection of the development and civilization of a city.&quot; Zhang Jingyuan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Luo Youyou, Feng Yun, and Liu Doudou are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[天才球员涉嫌赌球，意大利足球堕落无止境]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259262]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/24/R7D0tn7A3MRpCWFSffZ5mPIjzpSZUTqJkmfJjHsd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/R7D0tn7A3MRpCWFSffZ5mPIjzpSZUTqJkm fJjHsd. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255279&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first round of the new Serie A season, Juventus won 3-0 against Udinese. Pogba, the team’s top star and a world-record transfer fee, was on the bench. After watching the game, he underwent a drug test after the game. On September 12, the Italian Anti-Doping Agency announced that Pogba tested positive for drugs and would be temporarily suspended. Subsequently, his B bottle still detected dehydroepiandrosterone. The only good thing is that this substance is widely used in health products and there is a possibility of accidental ingestion. Pogba is currently still investigating what he took during the summer and is waiting for the final punishment. The most optimistic estimate is that he will be suspended for 3-6 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One wave has not subsided, and a bigger wave is coming. This time the protagonists are three young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faccioli, 22 years old, the best rookie in Serie A in the 2022-23 season, comes from Serie A giant Juventus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tonali, 23 years old, is the &quot;Prince&quot; of Serie A giant AC Milan. He will join the upstart Newcastle United in the Premier League in the summer of 2023 with a transfer fee of 70 million euros. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zaniolo, 24 years old, was once praised as Totti&#39;s successor at Roma Club and now plays for the Premier League powerhouse Aston Villa. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that the future is very good, but this is just the glamor on the surface. On the other hand, he is addicted to gambling and even bets on his own team&#39;s games. For this, he has incurred huge debts and has been threatened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was the famous paparazzi Corona who started this controversy. In August, he revealed that many Italian players gambled. Because he had so many misdeeds, not many people took him seriously at first. In fact, Fagioli was questioned by Turin prosecutors on June 23, and he subsequently surrendered to the sports prosecutor&#39;s office. He admitted that he had bet on many football games: from the Champions League, Serie A, La Liga, Premier League, to Serie B, Serie C and Turkish Super League, but he had never bet on Juventus. His behavior crossed the line. In Italy, betting is legal, but football players are not allowed to bet on football matches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fagioli said that he lost more than he won when gambling, and owed more and more money to gambling websites. The debt was about 3 million euros. Some of these websites were overseas. The operators forced him to pay back the money and threatened him. Said to break his legs. He also said that when he was in the National Youth Team, it was his teammate Tonali who suggested that he go to those websites to place bets. He heard that Tonali owed a lot of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tonali is currently the most valuable Italian player. At the end of September, the newly appointed Italian team coach Spalletti announced the squad and Tonali was selected. Spalletti&#39;s predecessor, Mancini, originally had a high reputation, but suddenly resigned on August 13, citing interference in his work by the chairman of the Football Association. Soon after, he went to Saudi Arabia to coach the national team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Corona exposed Faccioli, he also revealed the names of Tonali and Zaniolo. When the new Italian team was training, at the suggestion of the Turin prosecutor, the police went to the Covelciano base to question Tonali and Zaniolo. They were accompanied by the team leader Buffon when he played. He has also been accused of illegal betting. According to a report in La Repubblica, the two people almost cried in front of the police, and their mobile phones and tablets were confiscated by the police. The two soon left Coverciano, and the Italian Football Association stated in a statement that the two did not meet the necessary conditions for training and playing, allowing them to return to their respective clubs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faccioli has been suspended for 7 months. Tonali and Zaniolo are still under investigation. Tonali initially denied and then admitted that he had bet on Milan games. Zaniolo The situation is relatively optimistic. He firmly stated that he was only playing cards on an illegal website and no evidence of his gambling has been found so far. According to the whistleblower Corona, there are still many Serie A players on the blacklist. Is Serie A in trouble? Or is it always the same, no fuss? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After World War II, Serie A quickly developed into the most developed professional league in Europe, relying on internal factors such as economic prosperity and people&#39;s love for football, as well as external factors such as English League One&#39;s salary limit and the lack of the Bundesliga. The boss spends huge sums of money on the stars, the income of coaches and players is second to none in Europe, and the team has a brilliant record in European competitions. Starting in 1963, the two teams of Milan City won the Champions League four times in the 1960s. Also in 1963, Italy&#39;s industrial production increased by 209% compared with 1950, with an average annual growth rate of 9.1%, second only to Japan among major capitalist countries. The influx of money, the cruelty of professional football, and the huge interests involved in winning championships, rankings, and relegations have led to a desperate mentality for victory, and a large number of improper behaviors have occurred in Italian football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/uOv9Sbd8cPKJdCCM8B2hEAFZ8VtABp36MZDHtK6L.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;686&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/uOv9Sbd8cPKJdCCM8B2hEAFZ8VtABp36MZDHtK6L.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255281&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tonali is under investigation for betting on football.

When Patria led 2-0, players Fossati and Manucci told several teammates that Udinese wanted to win this game and was willing to pay. Patria then played poorly, conceding three goals in a row and losing the game. Udinese successfully avoided relegation. Several &quot;cooperating&quot; Patria players received money at a paper mill in Milan, about 150,000 lire each. They continued to play for the next two seasons, and could have played safely until retirement, but Patria&#39;s loss in November 1954 was investigated, which led to the previous match-fixing behavior. Team member Cetambrino admitted what he did during the previous loss to Udinese. In August 1955, Udinese was demoted to Serie B. Several players involved were punished. Some could no longer play football, and some were suspended for 3 years. Setambrino was only suspended for half a year because he cooperated with the judicial department. After retiring, he became a coach. Catania was also relegated along with Udinese. Their crime was to bribe the referee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After less than three years of calm, the &quot;Achini incident&quot; occurred in Serie A in the 1957-58 season. Because of match-fixing, Padua player Achini was banned for life (later commuted), and Atalanta was demoted to the last place in Serie A, thus falling into Serie B. A similar situation soon occurred again, and Genoa was severely punished in 1960. In April 1960, they were in a critical situation of relegation. Retired former international player Gino Capello acted as a broker. Before the game between Genoa and Atalanta, he found his former teammate Atalanta player Catozzo and left 1 million lire. , hope Atlanta loses to Genoa. Catozzo pretended to agree and then immediately informed Vice President Tentorio, who in turn contacted the investigative department. At the end of the season, Genoa ranked bottom with only 18 points and was relegated to Serie B. The bad luck of relegation cannot be avoided. The Italian Football Federation determined that they had committed illegal activities and deducted 25 points for this reason. So Genoa started playing Serie B with minus 7 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/8Bmy8KcXY8HCyNjLApGByXkoYzjOOb9jC0ajP2gN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/8Bmy8KcXY8HCyNjLApGByXkoYzjOOb9jC0ajP2gN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255280&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fagioli, who plays for Serie A team Juventus, was suspended for seven months for betting on football&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Doping testing suspicions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;These improper behaviors are the dark side of Serie A. In some aspects, Serie A is very advanced, such as doping testing. The Bundesliga in 1988 Post-match drug testing only began in 2018. In February 1964, Bologna defeated Turin 4-1 and achieved ten consecutive Serie A victories. After the game, five players from each team took drug tests. In early March, the test results were announced. Five of Bologna&#39;s players were all positive and tested positive for amphetamines. For this reason, the win against Turin was changed to a loss, and one point was deducted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bologna is very dissatisfied because the suspicion is obvious: the amphetamine content in the urine sample is too high, so high that it can cause death, and no one can bear it. After three lawyers filed a complaint with the prosecutor&#39;s office, prosecutors ordered the urine samples to be seized. The urine sample was retested, and this time the problem was complicated: amphetamine was not detected, so there must have been some manipulation before; no one knew who did it and what the motive was. Many years later, Bologna&#39;s team doctor mentioned a name: Milan&#39;s technical director Viani. This season, Milan and Bologna once formed a competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, with three rounds left in Serie A, the penalty against Bologna was cancelled, and they were tied for first place with Inter Milan. After the last three rounds, the two teams have the same points. According to the rules, they have to play the play-offs at a neutral site. Before the game, the presidents of the two clubs, Bologna&#39;s Dalala and Inter Milan&#39;s Moratti, came to the league headquarters to discuss the details of the game. When the two were arguing about the game bonus, Dalala suffered a heart attack and died unfortunately. Four days later, his Bologna side beat Inter Milan to win the Serie A title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inter Milan lost the Serie A title this season, won the Champions League, and defeated Benfica at San Siro a year later to retain the Champions League. They have a luxurious lineup and excellent record. They are known as the big Inter Milan, but their reputation is not good: their victory depends on chain defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6XOCslE9MB6cZIao8TIMM5qhnX1wgwmaD3Plp344.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;601&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6XOCslE9MB6cZIao8TIMM5qhnX1wgwmaD3Plp344.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255278&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2006, Juventus executive director Giraudo (left) and manager Moggi (right) watched head coach Capello (middle) leading the team to train&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Style and Morality&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chain defense originally refers to a line of defense , the method is to set up free men and implement man-to-man marking to protect the safety of the goal to the greatest extent, and then it has become a symbol of a mentality and football style: passive, utilitarian, giving up possession of the ball, only caring about the result, not caring about the scene, and even using any means. The 1965 Champions League final is an excellent example of the chain defense: Inter Milan&#39;s Pizzi played as a free man, with three defenders in front of him, plus a defensive midfielder. Before the end of the first half, Inter Milan scored a goal, and then Benfica&#39;s goalkeeper was injured and came off the field. Since there was no substitution rule, they could only let defender Germano guard the goal. Facing an opponent with one less player, Inter Milan continued to defend, just wanting to maintain its lead, and finally achieved its wish to win the championship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This championship is of extraordinary significance, symbolizing that Italian football has formed its own style. Such a process, whether it is established or changed, will take at least 10-15 years in terms of time, championships in terms of performance, the need to get rid of dependence on foreign coaches in terms of coaching, and the creation of a concept in terms of language to cover and present this style, and someone to serve as the Trumpeter and interpreter, this person can only be Mingji Brera. Serie A resumed in 1946; at the beginning of the 1957-58 season, there was no Hungarian coach in Serie A; in 1960, Viani led the Italian team to participate in the Rome Olympics, and the libero tactic took root in the national team and was used for many years until 1994 The Italian team did not give up free agents until the World Cup in 1963; in the 1963 Champions League final, Milan&#39;s Pivatelli fouled Benfica&#39;s Coluna. That kick ended the innocent era of the Champions League and also helped the Italian team. Won the Champions League for the first time; then Inter Milan won the Champions League twice. All this laid the foundation for the chain defense. This name became synonymous with Italian football and is difficult to separate and continues to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every country has to go through this journey to find, explore and determine its own style of football. Some disgraceful practices are inevitable, and everyone has their moments of embarrassment. The special thing about Italian football is that the aesthetics of football are much inferior when establishing style. Internally, Bernardini, who is very ambitious, is not as influential as Rocco, Herrera and others; externally, it is difficult to match the all-round football of the Netherlands and Brazil. Beautiful football; and not noble enough in terms of morality. In order to win, he will do anything and not care about anything. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Z5OZ4tgPFC9VzVqEgaERzBzKs8QzXYZI4IAazdB4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Z5OZ4tgPFC9VzVqEgaERzBzKs8QzXYZI4IAazdB4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255284&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zaniolo, who plays for the Premier League team Aston Villa, is under investigation for gambling&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The end justifies the means&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to conservative tactics, the Italian team has also been criticized for taking banned drugs, bribing referees, and using off-the-table tricks. In the 1966 Champions League semi-finals, Inter Milan lost to Real Madrid. Hungarian referee Vadas officiated the second round. He was meticulous and impartial. Real Madrid tied Inter Milan 1-1 and advanced with a total score of 2-1. A few years later, Vardas revealed to reporters that Inter Milan&#39;s agent Solti approached him, but he refused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Solti is also a Hungarian, and he not only serves Inter Milan. In the 1973 Champions League semi-finals, Juventus eliminated Derby County. After the first round, Derby County coach Clough was extremely unconvinced and cursed. His anger was not without reason. Solti gave the referee of the second round, the Portuguese Lobo, $5,000 and a car. Lobo did not accept it and reported it to the referee. He enforced the second round fairly, but the loss in the first round was no longer possible. Redeemable. Later, the famous British journalist Granville went to Portugal and other places to investigate and obtained real and powerful evidence. In 1974, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; published it to the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1974, Italian football was at a low point. The national team only won one game throughout the year, defeating lowly Haiti in the World Cup. In the Champions League finals of the previous two years, Inter Milan and Juventus both lost to Ajax, and they were completely at a disadvantage, with no chance of winning. Subsequently, under the leadership of coaches such as Berzotte and Radice, Italian football began to innovate tactics and reopened the door to foreign aid in 1980. Just when the foreign aid ban was about to be lifted and the future was bright, another match-fixing scandal was exposed in Serie A, namely the Totonero incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/WLN5tfiUnHrWbSO3DhufVC6PWaVo68JzuXmF6bdz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;636&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/WLN5tfiUnHrWbSO3DhufVC6PWaVo68JzuXmF6bdz.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255282&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 11, 1982, in the Spanish World Cup final, the Italian team defeated West Germany 3-1. Paolo Rossi celebrated the victory by lifting the trophy&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The match-fixing was not performed well&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The trigger was the report of two businessmen. The two knew some Lazio players, so they came up with a business opportunity and decided to conspire with the players to make money by fixing games and illegal betting. The Lazio players agreed. The first attempt was a friendly match in November 1979, which ended in a draw as agreed in advance. However, many subsequent games did not result in the preset results, resulting in the two losing a lot of money and being threatened by their creditors. Desperate and unable to bear it any longer, the two submitted a report to prosecutors listing the names of 13 teams and 27 players. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Italian Fiscal Guard subsequently took action. On March 23, 1980, during the Serie A match between Lazio and Pescara, the Fiscal Guard drove onto the runway of the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. This scene shocked the country. Subsequently, many players were arrested or surrendered, involving five Serie A teams and two Serie B teams. Milan Club Chairman Colombo was also taken away by the police. In the end, Serie A teams Milan and Lazio were relegated to Serie B, and many players were banned. The most famous of them was Paolo Rossi. He was initially suspended for three years, and then reduced to two years, just in time for the 1982 World Cup. He scored six goals and contributed greatly to the Italian team&#39;s championship. But all those arrested were acquitted because the laws in Italy were weak at the time and they had not broken the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Serie A lifted the ban on foreign players, Roma introduced Brazilian star Falcao, and then recruited his compatriot Cerezo. They reached the Champions League final in 1984, losing to Liverpool in a penalty shootout. There was no controversy in this final, the dirty deeds occurred in the semi-finals. In the first round, Roma lost to Dundee United away from home. Before the second round, they paid famous French whistleblower Michel Utu 100 million lire. They won 3-0 in the end. The third goal was a suspicious penalty kick, which attracted the attention of the outside world. widespread doubts. Within the Roma club, it was an open secret to bribe Utu. Two years later, Roma president Viola was banned by UEFA for bribing referees. His son publicly told the details of sending money to Utu years later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1984 Champions League final, Roma lost. A year later, Juventus won, winning this trophy for the first time in team history. It was also the first time an Italian team won the trophy after 16 years. Marking the renaissance of Serie A. Berlusconi&#39;s Milan then became the Serie A champion and European hegemon, reaching the Champions League finals five times in seven years and winning the title three times. With the influence of the Milan club, Berlusconi also became prime minister. One of his purposes in entering politics was to escape legal sanctions. After he succeeded, he blatantly used political operations to protect himself and his company. Everyone knew that he was doing whatever was wrong, but there was nothing he could do except condemn him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/MnezoqJxbx4YwibyOkffjg0V2hr27UmPx95DjVgk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;783&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/MnezoqJxbx4YwibyOkffjg0V2hr27UmPx95DjVgk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255283&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2011, former Italian youth team goalkeeper Marco Paolini, a goalkeeper from the Roma youth academy, was arrested by the local police on suspicion of match-fixing&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Doping, phone calls and false accounts&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Juventus wins the title for the second time They won the Champions League in 1996, and their physical fitness was amazing at that time.

The Italian judicial department began a six-year investigation. Finally, in November 2004, the Turin District Court sentenced Agricola, Juventus&#39;s medical director, to 22 months in prison with a suspended sentence. The court held that between 1994 and 1998, he made many Juventus players take EPO (erythroblast stimulating hormone), but the players did not know it. Everyone was safe except Agricola. Juventus executive director Giraudo was found not guilty. He said the verdict reaffirmed his innocence. Juventus is innocent, and Agricola will continue to be Juventus&#39; team doctor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Giraudo was not happy for long. On May 4, 2006, &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; published the contents of a call between Juventus manager Moggi and the Serie A referee assignor, which shocked Italian football. Moggi soon admitted that he had bribed referees and Football Association officials. The Juventus board of directors, including Moggi and Giraudo, resigned collectively, and the president and vice-president of the Italian Football Association also resigned. The Italian Sports Tribunal relegated Juventus to Serie B, deprived them of their two Serie A titles, and punished Milan, Fiorentina and Lazio with point deductions. Giraudo was also punished, and he has not given up since then, hoping for a retrial. In 2020, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, and there has been progress in the process recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While Giraudo was running for himself, his old club Juventus had already experienced another punishment after the phone call. The crime this time was financial fraud, for which 7 Serie A points were deducted. Like Moggi and Giraudo in the past, the then chairman Andrea Agnelli led the management to resign collectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at the turmoil and disgrace in Italian football, some are due to the failure to introduce and amend the law in time, which has led to some people escaping jail and encouraged others; some are due to the advanced measures taken. Unscrupulous people take advantage of it; some are overconfident, unscrupulous, and contemptuous of rules and public opinion; and some behaviors are universal and due to human nature, such as match-fixing and doping. German coach Neuerluhle said in 2007 that he was When coaching Schalke 04, I personally saw players taking Captagon. &quot;This is not a secret, it has become a routine. It has become a part of football, and 50% of the players are using this drug.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;The Italian national team won the European Cup in 2021, which brought a brief boost. Then Italian football fell into a trough and suffered a blow. The latest illegal gambling by young players reflects and participates in the current situation in Italy: the economy is facing difficulties, the administrative system is inefficient, and some social problems are hopeless. French scholar Bloch said that a person is better like the era in which he lived than his father. The same is true for a country&#39;s football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[晚明“王学误国”正确吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259199]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/24/IZqRHIooVi8eeNbCb6YtNanNPdrjN4Vi2W6wkWRD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1061&quot; height=&quot;2141&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/IZqRHIooVi8eeNbCb6YtNanNPdrjN4Vi2W6w kWRD. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255084&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Portrait scroll of Wang Shouren in the National Museum. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Jiajing period, the Ming Dynasty has suffered from internal and external troubles and numerous crises. Some people attribute it to Yangming&#39;s philosophy of &quot;talking about harming the country&quot;. After the Ding Revolution, the survivors of the Ming Dynasty learned from the pain, reflected on the historical lessons of the country&#39;s subjugation, and believed that &quot;Wang Xue&quot; was one of the culprits. The most representative figure among them is Gu Yanwu. In his article &quot;The Master&#39;s Words and the Way of Heaven&quot;, He denounced Wang Xue&#39;s &quot;empty words of understanding one&#39;s mind and one&#39;s nature, replacing the practical knowledge of cultivating oneself and governing others&quot;, which resulted in &quot;the collapse of the Chinese state and the ruins of clans and societies!&quot; Famous Confucian scholars such as Zhang Luxiang, Lu Longqi, Lu Shiyi, and Xiong Cilu all expressed this opinion. , and advocated the revitalization of Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism and the application of practical knowledge to correct the shortcomings of Wang Xue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Chengzhi, a survivor of the Ming Dynasty, said unceremoniously in a letter to Gu Yanwu&#39;s nephew Xu Yuanwen that Gu Yanwu&#39;s denigration of Yangming&#39;s studies was just a remnant of the spit of an old student in Wujiang, and had no factual basis. , very emotional. Some modern scholars have expressed doubts about Gu&#39;s statement. The author believes that the &quot;Wang Xue theory of subjugation of the country&quot; is divorced from the facts and is the product of the party struggle at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/dE644zekk4itpgNoM2BQWeY7aFJ8XwkF3LS0IQYz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1790&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/dE644zekk4itpgNoM2BQWeY7aFJ8XwkF3LS0IQYz.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255083&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The statue of Gu Yan is in the collection of the National Museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, theoretically speaking, Yangming&#39;s philosophy of mind is not a study of mysterious emptiness and emptiness as Gu and others said, but a study of practical application of the world. In his &quot;Reply to Gu Dongqiao&quot;, Yangming criticized &quot;those stubborn, empty and quiet people&quot; who &quot;cannot govern the country and the world&quot;, and advocated &quot;practicing one&#39;s work&quot; and integrating knowledge and action. He publicly declared that he disdained the study of exegesis, memorization, and verses. He said that practicing verses was &quot;as if he were on the stage of a hundred plays.&quot; It&#39;s shameful.&quot; Wang Yangming had the ambition to help the world since he was a child. He studied riding and archery, and studied the art of war. He once went deep outside the Great Wall to inspect geography. The most outstanding sign of his integration of knowledge and action was the application of the art of mind to military practice. According to his disciple Wang Ji&#39;s &quot;Yu Yu&quot; Recalling the article &quot;Xu Jiang&quot;: When I asked my former master what was the secret behind the saying that he was like a god in using troops, the master said: &quot;I have no secret skills, but I have always believed in conscience. Whenever I take advantage of the opportunity to face the enemy, I only have this little bit of spiritual intelligence and spiritual response.&quot; , I am not moved by the interests of life and death, so my plans are carefully planned, and the enemy does not know where he is coming. I am originally a person who practices my duty, but the world mistakenly thinks that I am a god.&quot; Volume 4 of He Liangjun&#39;s &quot;Siyou Zhaicong Shuo&quot; concludes : Wang Yangming said, &quot;The military is based on lectures and tactics are used, and the administration is based on lectures and political skills.&quot; The mutual complementation of academics and achievements enabled Yangming to achieve great success in the military. During the Jiajing period, in response to the imperial court&#39;s outright rejection of Yangming&#39;s scholarship, Huang Wan pointed out that the essence of Yangming&#39;s scholarship was &quot;to consider what people say and do, and not to just talk in vain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, from a practical point of view, many disciples of the Wang Sect and their followers have made achievements that will be remembered by future generations. Yangming did not regard knowledge as the only criterion for accepting disciples. Among his disciples were potters, farmers, woodcutter, etc. There were knights who &quot;fighted dragons and snakes with bare hands&quot;, counselors who made plans, and generals who led troops to fight. For example, Hu Zongxian, a disciple of Ouyang De, led the army and people of Zhejiang to fight against Japanese invaders, and planned to capture and kill the great Japanese pirates Wang Zhi and Xu Hai to quell the Japanese invaders in Zhejiang and Zhejiang. Weng Wanda, governor of Shaanxi and governor of Xuanda, was one of the coffin bearers when Wang Yangming was buried. He was friendly with Yangming&#39;s disciples Ouyang De, Luo Hongxian, Tang Shunzhi, Wang Ji and others. Weng Wanda was in charge of the northern border defense for five or six years, and made outstanding achievements in fighting against the invasion of Mongolia. Guo Zizhang, a disciple of Ouyang De, patrolled Guizhou in the 26th year of Wanli (1598). He worked with Li Hualong to suppress Yang Yinglong&#39;s rebellion in Bozhou and was known as the first famous official in central Guizhou. Luo Rufang, a student of Yan Jun, was criticized by people in the early Qing Dynasty for &quot;talking about nothing&quot;. In fact, he visited many places to study and inspect society in his early years. In the early years of Wanli, the imperial court adopted a policy of appeasement against the expansion and aggression of the Burmese king. According to the &quot;Bureau&quot;, Luo Rufang, who was then a right-hand political participant in Yunnan, planned to encircle the Mang clan of the Burmese king. However, his success fell short because someone slandered the governor Wang Ning. Luo Rufang &quot; He threw himself to the ground in anger and cursed loudly.&quot; This caused serious trouble, and the Burmese army invaded Yunnan in a large scale. Li Cai, who had studied under Zou Shouyi, wiped out pirates and Japanese pirates when he was in Guangdong; when he was in Yunnan, he defeated the Burmese invasion. Luo Hongxian, the number one scholar of the Private Shu Wang Yangming, is described in the original &quot;History of the Ming Dynasty&quot; as &quot;leaping a horse and drawing a bow, studying the history&quot;, and the river channels, frontier fortresses, battle formations, offensive and defensive, etc. are not studied in detail. Shunzhi of Tang Dynasty in Huiyuan Dynasty, who &quot;heard the words of conscience from Wang Ji&quot;, is said in the &quot;History of Ming Dynasty&quot; to &quot;know everything about learning&quot; and pay special attention to practical learning. He &quot;never forgot the world and the country in his heart&quot;, and until his deathbed, he still thought about the safety of the country and did not care about his private affairs. In the thirty-sixth year of Jiajing&#39;s reign (1557), Zhao Wenhua, a member of Yan Song&#39;s party, supervised the military affairs of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and recommended him as the chief of the Nanjing Ministry of War. Shun Zhi put the country first, regardless of the tarnished reputation, and resolutely came out of the mountain. He inspected Jizhen, verified the number of troops, and put forward many practical suggestions. He also assisted Hu Zongxian in fighting against Japanese invaders, patrolled the sea to inspect the situation of bandits, formulated strategies to attack, intercept and block the enemy, and personally commanded and won great victories such as Yaojiadang. The famous anti-Japanese generals Tan Lun, Yu Dayou, Qi Jiguang, Liu Xian, etc. were all appreciated and promoted by him. In addition, Yan Jun, Xu Wei, disciples of the Wang family, and Zheng Ruozeng, who was influenced by Yangming&#39;s psychology, all served in the Hu Zongxian shogunate and made their own contributions to the pacification of Japan in different ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many military generals with great military exploits are also disciples of the Wang Clan. For example, Governor Wanbiao got his philosophical ideas from Wang Ji, Luo Hongxian, Qian Dehong and Tang Shunzhi. He once personally led the monk soldiers to fight against the Japanese pirates at Yangjing Bridge in Suzhou, and he was hit by an arrow but did not get out of the line of fire. Yu Dayou followed Yangming&#39;s Xinxue in his early years and later studied under Tang Shunzhi. Qi Jiguang was also &quot;a private person of Shu Yangming and a great expounder of conscience&quot;. He once entered Qian Dehong&#39;s family, and Qian Dehong recommended him to Hu Zongxian. Qi Jiguang advocated taking &quot;sincerity&quot; as the work force, &quot;practicing it personally&quot;, and focusing on &quot;treating the mind&quot; in military training. Deng Zilong learned from Luo Hong before he became an official, and he kept it in mind throughout his life. He fought in all directions and made many meritorious deeds. Later, in the war to aid Korea, even though he was nearly seventy years old, he fought bravely to kill the enemy and sacrificed his life for the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from this that since the Ming Dynasty, everyone in the Wang family has been a person of great achievements. On the other hand, among the Donglin Party members, except for loyal and honest ministers, there are very few capable ministers in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the grim reality of &quot;the sky collapsed and the earth collapsed&quot; in the late Ming Dynasty, the Donglin Party members mistakenly blamed Wang Xue and believed that Zhu Zixue was the panacea to save the world. They criticize the corrupt Confucians for being &quot;ignorant of affairs and current affairs. They harm one person, harm the whole family, harm one country, and harm the whole world.&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of Donglin Academy· Donglin Theory of Learning&quot;) This is precisely the self-portrait of the Donglin Party members. The Taizhou School founded by Wang Gen, a disciple of Yangming, has long pointed out that &quot;human relations physics&quot; and &quot;common people&#39;s daily needs&quot; are Tao, and the disciples of Cheng and Zhu are the corrupt Confucians who &quot;do not understand affairs and are not familiar with current affairs.&quot; In the second year of Duanping in the Southern Song Dynasty (1234), the Neo-Confucian master Zhen Dexiu paid homage to Zhen Dexiu to consult on political affairs. People had high expectations for him, thinking that he could establish peace. However, after Zhen Dexiu took office, Prime Minister Zheng Qingzhi did nothing and could not save the declining Southern Song Dynasty. Therefore, the Yuan people&#39;s cancellation of the imperial examination for a time had something to do with the empty talk of Song Confucianism that harmed the country. Song Lian, the leader of civil servants in the early Ming Dynasty, advocated the use of Confucianism, but he had to admit in the &quot;Biography of Wu Deji&quot; that Song Confucianism could not do much more in promoting Confucianism, but in the end he did not make much difference to the world. By the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism was on the verge of &quot;dying to death&quot; because the late Neo-Confucianists &quot;only discussed it in footnotes&quot;. In &quot;Remembering the Past&quot;, Li Zhi mocked the pedantic Confucians who &quot;have nothing to do in their daily lives, only do bows and bows, and sit all day long. They are like clay sculptures and think that they cannot afford distracting thoughts. This is the real great sage and great sage.&quot; And &quot;when there is a police officer, they look at each other with no color, and even blame each other, thinking they can be wise.&quot; In &quot;The Biography of Mr. Yangming, the Confucian Prince of the Ming Dynasty&quot;, the scholar Shen Shixing sharply criticized those who attacked Wang Yangming: &quot;Most of the Confucian officials in modern times take it for granted that they are well-dressed and well-dressed, but when it comes to their daily use, they often suffer from rigidity and nothing.&quot; To make achievements; to study extensively and listen in order to learn, but to find out the actual results, they are often obsessed with what they have seen and heard without experiencing, and the customs have been immersed in them for a long time!&quot; This kind of person may be morally impeccable, but he is mediocre and incompetent, and only knows how to die in literature. Advice, fight to the death. Donglin Party members equate morality with ability, and due to the limitations of the times, it is difficult to give a fair definition of &quot;morality&quot;. In the face of foreign aggression, they do not know how to adapt and are immoral. Zhang Luxiang&#39;s &quot;Yuan Xue Ji&quot; says that &quot;Yangming used troops mostly to win by deceit, which Confucians would not do.&quot; University scholar Wang Xijue pointedly pointed out: Zou Yuanbiao, the highly respected moral benchmark in Donglin, is just a &quot;student with simple wishes and no other extraordinary ideas.&quot; There is a shortage of talents in the temple, and there is an urgent need to break down barriers and recruit talents in any way. Zhang Juzheng had long been dissatisfied with the &quot;conventional and vulgar Confucianism&quot; and called for &quot;heroic and true Confucianism&quot;. Jiang Yingke said in &quot;Ancient Theory on Employment&quot;: &quot;To achieve great things, do not pay attention to details; to achieve great achievements, do not pay attention to small righteousness.&quot; Some people even want to select talents from the grassland. Li Zhi especially praised the pirate Lin Daoqian, Zhong In &quot;Preface to Water Margin&quot;, Xing also lamented that &quot;there are no Li Kui or Wu Yong in the world&quot; and &quot;every time I recite the autumn wind, I think of the warriors and shout madly for them.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to corrupt Confucianism, pseudo-Taoism is more harmful. Li Zhi had long criticized the pseudo-Confucianism in &quot;The Theory of the Return of Three Religions to Confucianism&quot; that &quot;yang represents Taoism, yin represents wealth and honor, being subdued by elegance, and behaving like a dog and a pig.&quot; The Donglin Party members adhered to their sectarian views. After taking control of the election, &quot;anyone who disobeys Donglin will be accused of being traitorous.&quot; Later, the society was restored to &quot;hijack the government and control the government from afar.&quot; On the occasion of the change of dynasty, many Donglin Party members &quot;changed their rules and changed their ways&quot;, which was surprising. Therefore, Li Zhi said long ago in &quot;Party Stele&quot;: Secular people &quot;only know that villains can harm the country, but they don&#39;t know that gentlemen can harm the country.&quot; Wei Xi&#39;s &quot;On the Song Dynasty&quot; also said: &quot;The disasters of the country are not caused by villains, but by gentlemen.&quot; They are members of the same party and oppose differences. They do not pursue selfish interests, are interested in fame and profit, and do not hesitate to kill themselves to gain fame. This is what Zhang Tingyu said in &quot;Cheng Huai&quot; It is said in &quot;Yuan Yu&quot; that &quot;killing the remains of parents will lead to the tyranny of the country, loyalty and filial piety, and both will be damaged.&quot; Therefore, some knowledgeable people in the early Qing Dynasty believed that the Ming Dynasty did not fall to rogue bandits, but to Donglin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to partisan factors, &quot;The Theory of Wang Xue Misleading the Country&quot; also has a strong regional flavor. In the Ming Dynasty, the Donglin Party and the Zhejiang Party were at odds with each other. Later, the Zhejiang Party relied on the Eunuch Party, and they even fought to the death. In academic terms, Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism and Lu Wang Xinxue were also on the same page. From the late Ming Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, those who sympathized with the Donglin Party People have the right to speak, and the mainstream ideology is Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism. During the Daoguang period, Liang Shaoren, a native of Qiantang, expressed strong dissatisfaction with this in his &quot;Essays on Two Kinds of Autumn Rains&quot;. He believed that &quot;Wang Wencheng&#39;s achievements are shining brightly, and he is the best of his generation. He only reveals the world with his conscience, which is a little tired of his cleverness, and the debaters are extremely intent on slandering him. It is said that the world with Ming will not perish by bandits but perish by Yang Ming, how can you say it!&quot; He sighed: &quot;Today the world is all disciples of Zi Yang, no wonder thousands of people gathered together to point it out!&quot; According to Liang Qichao&#39;s &quot;China in the Recent Three Years&quot; According to &quot;A Hundred Years of Academic History&quot;, in the early Qing Dynasty, even righteous men such as Huang Daozhou, Zhang Huangyan, Wang Yi, Qu Shishu, Chen Zizhuang, Zhang Jiayu, etc. who insisted on resisting the Qing Dynasty and restoring the Ming Dynasty did not dare to consider themselves to have &quot;come from the arms of the mother of the Yangming School&quot; &quot;Nurture them out&quot;, but their motivation to resist the Qing Dynasty actually came from the Yangming School. It can be seen that Cheng and Zhu were powerful in the Qing Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[对话上野千鹤子：学术是弱者的武器]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259304]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Who is Chizuru Ueno?

Ueno believes that men often show contempt for women, while women show self-loathing: &quot;If I am 100% not misogynistic, there is no need to be a feminist, because I no longer need to fight. Feminism means constant People who struggle with inner misogyny.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, netizens have often habitually incorporated it into their own life situations to explain the underlying causes of many unpleasant events in life, such as secretly filming women Private photos are uploaded online, gender discrimination in the workplace, product advertising creates body anxiety, celebrities &quot;cheat&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Publisher Chen Xiying published a collection of conversations between Chizuru Ueno and manga artist Nagako Tamafusa in 2021 &quot;From &quot;Feminism from Scratch&quot; has actual sales of more than 200,000 copies and continues to be printed. In Chen Xiying’s impression, after the word feminism entered China, everyone was still relatively unfamiliar with its connotation and denotation. However, &quot;Feminism from Scratch&quot; is a popular work that integrates daily life into Examples are readily available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dialogue in the book basically revolves around women&#39;s &quot;parental shortcomings&quot;, from the length of the skirts of female students&#39; school uniforms to the fact that women are often accused of &quot;revealing clothing&quot; in sexual harassment cases; from the plots of popular TV series to the dilemma of female childbearing; even when talking about the media&#39;s shaping of teenagers, it makes readers realize that the setting of Shizuka in &quot;Doraemon&quot; both attracting men and rebuking men is also a kind of &quot;misogyny&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese publishing industry published seven Ueno books in 2022, including the best-selling book &quot;Starting at the Limit&quot;. Since 2023, Ueno has published more than ten books in China, including serious academic works, as well as relatively light popular readings and dialogue collections. The content covers Chizuru Ueno&#39;s areas of concern in the past forty years. For example, &quot;Women&#39;s Thoughts&quot;, which combs the ideological context of Japanese women&#39;s studies, &quot;Unpaid Housewives&quot;, which cares about the &quot;unpaid&quot; work of housewives, and &quot;A Man&#39;s Old Queen&quot;, which focuses on the issue of elderly care...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Beijing In an Internet celebrity bookstore that mainly sells best-selling books, Southern Weekend reporters saw that the most conspicuous place at the entrance was Chizuru Ueno&#39;s &quot;Women&#39;s Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Feminism from Scratch&quot;, &quot;Misogyny&quot; and &quot;For Survival&quot;. &quot;Thoughts&quot; and other works are placed together with popular and practical books such as &quot;How to Deal with Divorce&quot; and &quot;Common Knowledge of Civil Code in Marriage and Love&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SrcR5l7rtqhN3frsIcAX3tA9Zg3p67jAex2MFCJF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SrcR5l7rtqhN3frsIcAX3tA9Zg3p67jAex2MFCJF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255379&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chizuru Ueno&#39;s teachings have great influence in Chinese academic circles and the public sphere. Lu Weiwei, a professor at Southeast University who had invited Chizuru Ueno as a visiting scholar, was influenced by her and established a gender research group at the school. The most subscribed female podcast program &quot;Random Fluctuation&quot; on the Xiaoyu App started talking about Chizuru Ueno in the first episode.

It is a misunderstanding that many people have about single women, so it has offended many people on the Internet. Netizens spontaneously posted in defense of Chizuru Ueno, believing that the three bloggers did not understand what feminism was and that such questions were very &quot;misogynistic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;I like communicating with people from the bottom of my heart&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On social platforms, Chizuru Ueno shows off her iconic red hair.

For example, she once strongly criticized the gender injustice in Japanese society, exposing the reality of how women are coerced by &quot;maternal love&quot; and extracting &quot;surplus value&quot;, and said: &quot;Shout when it hurts&quot; Pain, human dignity begins here.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I got to know Chizuru Ueno through Professor Toyo Suga of the University of Tokyo. Suga is a famous Japanese folklorist. He told me that Ueno plays an important role in the whole of Japan. Her influence in the field of humanities and social sciences ranks among the top five, so I must read more of her works.&quot; Lu Weiwei, a professor at the School of Foreign Languages ​​at Southeast University, told Southern Weekend reporters. As one of Ueno&#39;s earliest researchers and translators in China, Lu Weiwei was originally engaged in folklore research. In recent years, she has also taken gender studies as her main research direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Weiwei has systematically read more than 30 works by Chizuru Ueno. She concluded: &quot;Ueno and his peers established Japanese women&#39;s studies, and things that were not included in academic vision in the past began to be taken seriously. Research, she identified such an academic field.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retiring from the University of Tokyo, Chizuru Ueno has been very active, and her research has gradually shifted to issues such as elderly care and care. Lu Weiwei recalled: &quot;When I visited Teacher Ueno in Tokyo in July 2023, she also gave me three new books. She is 75 years old and is still actively working and writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Lu Weiwei planned The &quot;Todai × Todai&quot; (abbreviations for the University of Tokyo and Southeast University respectively) series of lectures invites Ueno to give lectures at Southeast University in 2019. Classes run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day, and Ueno often takes the initiative to ask for extra classes. From gender studies to aging studies, Chizuru Ueno &quot;teaches everything&quot; in almost all fields of her research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After finishing the course at Southeast University, Lu Weiwei accompanied Ueno to visit several cities such as Xi&#39;an, Harbin, Changchun and Beijing, and gave sharings at different universities. After 18 days of contact, Lu Weiwei got a deeper understanding of Ueno: &quot;She is very curious and very considerate. I praised the umbrella she brought with her for its practicality and beauty, and she gave it to me before leaving.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media person Qing Qingzi planned and published a collection of dialogues between female scholars, which included her in-depth interview with Chizuru Ueno in 2021. During the exchange, Ueno not only expressed her own opinions, but also listened carefully and listened carefully to the interview. The situation in China is of great interest. Since the video interview was very long, Chizuru Ueno even ordered a cake and said, &quot;If we meet, we can eat it together.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingqingzi felt that Ueno was a very candid scholar. Although she said that she did not want to expose her personal side, she was still very willing to expose herself when the conversation was enjoyable. After getting to know each other through interviews, Qingqingzi and Ueno maintained email communication like friends. &quot;Ueno really likes to communicate with people from the bottom of his heart.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, just a few days after Chizuru Ueno’s discussion about being single and getting married became a hot search topic on Weibo, the Japanese media “Shukan Bunshun” published an article titled “Chizuru Ueno, the founder of single education, naturalizes” The article &quot;Marriage&quot; broke the news that Chizuru Ueno and the late historian Shirkawa Daiyoshi had registered their marriage. Some people began to question Chizuru Ueno, believing that her words and deeds were inconsistent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 days later, Chizuru Ueno responded by publishing the article &quot;The 15-Hour Bride&quot; in the &quot;Woman Public Theory&quot; magazine to clarify the cause and effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seikawa is 23 years older than Ueno. His wife has passed away and his son has lost contact with her. Ueno has taken on the responsibility of taking care of Seikawa and helping him manage his assets. This relationship is exactly what Ueno wants to study for his retirement issues in his later years. Through practice, she hopes to establish an effective mutual-help relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, because Ueno is legally not related to Shikawa, he cannot sign the consent form for the operation at the critical moment, nor can he help him handle complex property matters. He is subject to Japanese family law. In order to facilitate the process, Various problems before and after Sechuan&#39;s death forced her to apply for marriage. Their marriage only lasted 15 hours before Sechuan passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t intend to hide this, but there was no reason to disclose it in the first place. Everyone who knows already knows, and my friends are not the kind to sell their friends&#39; privacy. Villain. But if there are outsiders spreading some false rumors, it would be better for me, the person involved, to tell these stories to everyone personally, so I wrote this article.&quot; At the end of the article, Chizuru Ueno wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Chizuru Ueno&#39;s new book &quot;Marry Me&quot; was published. In this book, she analyzed in detail her views on issues such as marriage and childbirth. On the cover of this new book, there is this sentence written: &quot;Towards a society where you can freely choose whether to marry, get married, or have children!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is no longer impossible to live without marriage&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can you briefly introduce the background of your writing &quot;Marry Me&quot; and what kind of opportunity it was for you to write it? Have you decided to talk specifically about the issue of being single and not getting married? I&#39;m also curious, has there been any change in Japan&#39;s unmarried group since this book was first published? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Among the female population of the same age, I belong to the less than 5% of unmarried people. Japan&#39;s lifelong non-marriage rate has continued to rise. By 2020, the non-marriage rate for men was 28.25% and for women was 18.81%. The government calls this statistic &quot;never-married.&quot; But I call it &quot;not married&quot;. Because &quot;unmarried&quot; means &quot;not yet married&quot;, implying that &quot;sooner or later you will get married.&quot; However, since there are so many people who are not married, it means that &quot;not getting married&quot; is not a stage of life, but a way of life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you get married or not, you have children, you don’t have children, you get divorced... There are more choices, which is a good thing. Rather than saying that this book had an impact on society, it is better to say that changes in society created needs that prompted the publication of this book. Because before this, those unmarried men and women have always suffered discrimination and were always asked &quot;Why don&#39;t you get married?&quot; This book aims to encourage those unmarried people to live an upright life, so I chose &quot;Not Married, Again&quot; how? &quot;(Editor&#39;s note: the original title of the Japanese version of &quot;Marry Me&quot;) is the title of the book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The marriage rate in Japan is also getting lower and lower. Do you think that behind the scenes? What is the reason? Are there different reasons why men choose not to marry and why women choose not to marry? If this continues, people&#39;s understanding of marriage will inevitably change. Do you think we have reached such a point now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Not only because marriage is no longer an attractive option, but also because I want to start a family. The cost is simply too high. That&#39;s why the number of men and women who don&#39;t get married will increase. Men and women show an asymmetry in their reasons for choosing not to marry. Men cannot get married, and women do not want to get married. In the past, marriage was a necessity of life for both men and women, and it was impossible to live without marriage. But in today&#39;s Japan, marriage is a &quot;life surplus asset&quot; that makes life richer. People&#39;s expectations for their spouses have also increased a lot compared to the past. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once said, &quot;Compared to not getting married, I I want to know more about the reasons for getting married.&quot; How do you understand women who enter into marriage? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Having sex because we are in love, having children and becoming parents out of our own will, this experience can make us Life is more abundant. However, many men and women get married and have children when they reach a certain age just for reasons such as obeying traditional customs, &quot;because of parents&#39; requirements&quot;, &quot;because of society&#39;s requirements&quot;. If they have never seen their parents have a happy married life, how can their children be motivated to get married? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If women had more choices, they would not choose to marry against their will. And if their married life is very unhappy, they can also escape from it. For this reason, men must make changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You were also exposed to marriage rumors a while ago, until you later made a statement State the cause and effect of the matter. What impact did this have on you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am still opposed to the (Japanese) marriage system. Unfortunately, the barriers to Japanese familialism laws are too thick, so I had no choice but to take advantage of the system to do something. To this day, I still deeply regret it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Marriage will not greatly change a woman’s life, but childbirth will&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When discussing marriage issues, we must also face the issue of fertility.

What do you think of this issue? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no inevitable relationship between marriage and childbirth. However, many people get married for the purpose of having children.

In China, some cities have begun to provide policy support for unmarried mothers such as settlement. There is a sentence on the cover of the Chinese version of &quot;Marry Me&quot;: &quot;Towards a society where you can freely choose not to marry, to get married, or to have children!&quot; Is this kind of social form possible? What efforts do people need to make? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Many unmarried single mothers mostly do not actively choose not to get married, but after learning the news of pregnancy, they make themselves The pregnant man ran away. However, they did not choose to induce labor, but chose to give birth to the child. The background condition is that he has the support of his parents in his hometown. Of course, there are also some women who actively choose to become unmarried single mothers because they have certain financial strength. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand of the Japanese women&#39;s movement is to &quot;establish a society where women can give birth and raise children alone.&quot; However, society still does not provide enough support to single mothers, and even assigns &quot;three, six, or nine&quot; categories to widowed single mothers, divorced single mothers, and unmarried single mothers. Only recently has discrimination between these categories been gradually erased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people believe that policies to support single mothers will encourage men&#39;s &quot;irresponsible&quot; mentality. There is indeed a problem at this level, but the government allocating a certain amount of tax money to support single mothers means that our society has a collective responsibility in raising the next generation, and this collective also includes men who pay more taxes. Some Nordic countries will impose mandatory alimony on the man who got the woman pregnant. If the man is unwilling to pay, the state will advance the payment for him and then hold the man accountable. Japan does not have such a system, which is really a headache. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For many women who are married and have children, they have to work, You have to take on housework; but if you don’t work, you can’t gain so-called “independence.” This seems to be a dilemma of modernity? Do you think there is a solution to this dilemma? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chizuru Ueno:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are four ways to share women’s family responsibilities: First, the first point is that men should also assume the same family responsibilities; the second point is that the state should provide public childcare services (such as providing nurseries, etc.) to reduce the childcare burden of citizens; the third point is to use the income earned by both parties from working together to hire someone to do housework; the fourth point is, Relying on the power of (maternal) grandmothers, but this approach simply shifts the responsibility from one generation of women to another. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, none of the above four methods exist.

I also met and talked to many women who were leading different lives. I have experience living in Germany. Both Japan and Germany were defeated countries in World War II, but what kind of relationships did they establish with their surrounding countries after the war? I was struck by the obvious difference between Germany and Japan on this point. To this day, Japan still has not been able to establish full trusting relations with neighboring countries such as South Korea and China, which it has invaded before.

&lt;p>;“地下偶像”拥有怎样的独特魅力？为何它会在今年强势吸粉、快速兴起？它与传统的偶像产业有何不同？作为一种舶来文化，它在中国的本土化发展面临着哪些考验？围绕着这些疑问，本刊记者近日走访了相关粉丝、运营者与新晋地下偶像，带大家进一步了解“地偶”这一略显新鲜的概念。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/046339fad3ec9f1b89ea0efa4819e3c0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/046339fad3ec9f1b89ea0efa4819e3c0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255294&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;什么是“地下偶像”？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;台上全开麦唱跳、台下沉浸式互动、“特典会”近距离“切聊”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;今年春天的一个周末，小章（化名）第一次去线下观看了“地下偶像”的拼盘演出，由此“入坑”开始追起“地偶”。在那之前，她对“地下偶像”这个词仅是有所耳闻。一个偶然的机会下，她在社交平台上看到了“地偶”的活动信息，了解到其表演内容中有自己平时喜欢听的日语歌曲，由此产生了兴趣，便与朋友一同去了现场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“很元气、全开麦真唱、感染力强”，这是小章第一次观看“地偶”演出的最大感受。 “感觉很开心！”小章感受到了演出者的真诚与努力，同时也被其中一位小偶像圈粉了，“感觉她的风格比较特别一些，很亮眼。”她回忆道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，当天观众的应援方式也给小章留下了深刻印象：“会有一群人把一个观众扛起来，从观众席的后面冲到舞台前与小偶像互动。”热烈的应援场面让其深感震撼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高度的互动感、各种有趣的应援方式也成为地下偶像演出的一种独特魅力，让观众和粉丝感到自己亦是这场演出中不可或缺的一部分。另一位“地偶”粉丝小洁（化名）告诉记者：“地下偶像让人觉得参与度更高，或者说（与偶像）距离更近一点，（和偶像的）互动会更多一点，他们在台上跳，在台下跳的观众也有很多，气氛更好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/6c019e1a06776ae7a95f3dfd96a5e51a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;856&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/6c019e1a06776ae7a95f3dfd96a5e51a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255295&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，“地偶”的观众中也不仅有闹腾的“社牛”群体。小章提到，那场演出的主办方为台下观众设置了分区，包括“静静观演区”“自由区”以及“女性区”三种。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“自由区”内，粉丝们会进行热烈的应援和互动，比如刚才提到的“起飞”——将观众托举起来“飞”向舞台；“静静观演区”则是为了内向的“i人”群体准备的，大家无需整活，只想默默在台下欣赏偶像的表演；而小章选择待在“女性区”，这部分观众会挥舞荧光棒为偶像打call，但远没有“自由区”那么激烈。分区观演的设置，确保了在观演过程中，不同个性的观众都可以沉浸其中，避免互相干扰与碰撞冲突。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;演出结束后，小章在接下来的“特典会”上，拥有了第一张与偶像的合照。 “特典会”是与地下偶像团体演出一同举行的活动，粉丝们可以在“特典会”上购买到偶像的相关周边产品，并通过购买“特典券”，来获得与偶像合照、近距离交流的机会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/14549802ae615da467c2d59460e18ef7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;421&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/14549802ae615da467c2d59460e18ef7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255299&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小章告诉记者，地下偶像演出的主办方会定期邀请各个地下偶像团体来做拼盘表演，演出票价按活动规模大小，从几十至200元不等（偶尔也有免费场次），票房的收入为演出主办方所有。而偶像团体公司与成员的收入则主要依靠粉丝在“特典会”上的消费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她向记者介绍，“地偶”粉丝将与偶像拍摄拍立得照片称为“拍切”（由拍立得的日语音译而来），偶像还会在“切”（照片）上留下专属签名涂鸦。拍一张带有偶像签名涂鸦的“切”，均价在80-100元左右；不带签名涂鸦的“切”，一张均价约为40-60元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;购买一张“特典券”，除了能够得到与偶像拍摄一张拍立得照片的机会，还意味着粉丝能拥有一分钟左右与偶像近距离聊天的机会，所以特典会也被称作“切聊会”（拍切+聊天）。小章告诉记者，粉丝在与偶像交流的同时，会有工作人员在旁边掐表计时。许多粉丝为了争取到更多与偶像接触的时间，会一次性买十几甚至几十张特典券。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;为什么需要“地下偶像”？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;情绪价值、高性价比、双向奔赴&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;谈起“入坑地偶”的原因，小章强调了“全开麦真唱”与“舞台感染力”的重要性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前，她也去观看过某些“地上”偶像团体（与“地下”相反、会在主流媒体上曝光的偶像艺人）的线下演出。为了保证演出质量，观众鲜少能看到全开麦唱跳的舞台。 “相比之下，&#39;地偶&#39;的舞台感染力更好一些，开麦唱歌真的很重要。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/db78036bddb3d20628f09a8334734652.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;393&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/db78036bddb3d20628f09a8334734652.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255296&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过地下偶像的舞台，小章能够感受到这些小偶像们是发自内心地喜欢唱歌跳舞。 “看到这个人在为自己热爱的梦想努力、在舞台上发光，自己也感觉有受到鼓舞。”或许许多人心中都曾有一个“偶像梦”，却碍于种种原因无法实现，“看见他们拼搏的样子就会觉得很美好，觉得自己也要努力一些（过好自己的生活）。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管地下偶像的唱跳水平参差不齐，部分成员还存在很大的进步空间，但在小章等粉丝们看来，敢开麦真唱就是一种值得肯定的态度，“至少他们很努力地在台上去展示自己。而且我觉得她（小章的偶像）唱歌是有进步的，能明显感受到。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;粉丝小洁在接受记者采访时，将追星的本质归结为“获得情绪价值”：“我们追偶像的目的，不是说我们的审美有多高，需要他们有多强的唱跳水准，只是追一个情绪价值。看偶像会让我们的生活更有趣一点，每个周末会更充实一点。工作那么累了，总得想着点什么来支撑下去。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e0574545470994e52f13ffa9b3659f74.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;434&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e0574545470994e52f13ffa9b3659f74.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255297&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在与记者的对话中，两位粉丝不约而同地提到，比起喜欢那些活跃在公众视野的主流偶像，追“地偶”拥有更高的性价比，能让她们在同等的付出下，获得更多的情绪价值。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;譬如“地上”偶像团体SNH48同样以“面对面的偶像”为运营模式，拥有剧场公演和与“特典会”类似的“握手会”，但其价格要远高于“地偶”。原价仅98元的门票价格被炒高，热门场次代抢费几十到几百元，而如果要第一排之类的VIP位置则需要竞价，动辄需要上千元。一张握手券（可与小偶像握手聊天10秒钟）便需要二三十元，签名券一两百元，合影券则要六七百元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;显然，当“地偶”提供合影、签名、面对面交流等服务时，粉丝可以用更少的花费收获更为丰富的情感体验。毕竟“地偶”拥有的粉丝数量远不及明星艺人，他们大多对自己的追随者有清晰的印象，会记得几乎每位粉丝的样貌、喜好、交流过的话题等种种细节，也有更多的精力和情感去作出回应，达成一种真正意义上的“双向奔赴”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e2ed8f51cdc6b930124e9867fa606f9c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;407&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/e2ed8f51cdc6b930124e9867fa606f9c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255298&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小洁向记者分享，自己曾因购买“特典券”累计达到一定数量而收获了一次粉丝福利——让偶像给自己写信。 “因为我之前给她写过一封信，她就写了一封回信。”在那封写给偶像的信中，小洁提到了自己每次去观看偶像演出时开心的心情，而这些内容也在回信中被偶像一一提及，“她跟我说（在回信中写到）其实收到我那封信的时候，刚好是她很不自信、很迷茫的时候，她说是我的那封信给了她很多力量。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，偶像也在心中诉说了她对这份职业的坚持与热爱，追梦多年的心路历程，“她说每次站在舞台上的时候，都会有一种手脚发麻的兴奋感。之前她的粉丝很少，也想过到底要不要继续下去，也迷茫过很长时间……但是最后她想明白了，只要享受站在舞台上的时刻就好了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小洁提到，相比起主流的明星艺人，“追地偶”的感觉更加纯粹。由于地下偶像未在媒体上曝光，接近素人的状态会更加真实松弛，没有公司的约束、人设的包装、大众的审视，粉丝们能在与偶像的交流中感到“像朋友一样的亲切感”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;谁在成为“地下偶像”？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;刘夏俊：“成为地下偶像后，我清楚地知道了是谁在为我应援”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;曾参加过《创造营2019》的唱跳偶像刘夏俊，在今年经历了“从地上转向地下”，成为男子“地偶”团体“搬砖汪汪队”的队长，从而拥有了再次登上舞台、与粉丝们近距离接触的机会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/c7291f74ef43b361586608e4792f9681.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/c7291f74ef43b361586608e4792f9681.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255300&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;刘夏俊（中）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘夏俊告诉记者，自从《创造营2019》后，他就鲜少再有上舞台唱跳的机会。起初，他作为前公司的艺人做着各类采访、拍摄的工作，后受疫情影响，公司解散重组，他的工作内容变成了直播。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但很快，并不适应直播的他意识到自己真正想做的事还是在舞台上唱跳，于是与公司解约，身份再次转向舞团成员与舞蹈老师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年初，刘夏俊身边的一位朋友得知有男子“地偶”团体正在招募成员，便立刻推荐刘夏俊去报名。 “他说看到报名要求的时候，就觉得这像是为我量身定做的——&#39;擅长唱跳、热爱舞台&#39;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由此，刘夏俊开始逐步了解“地偶”这个职业。 “这件事最吸引我的一点就是能上舞台。”在搜索资料、线下观摩后，其对舞台的热爱和向往打败了所有犹豫和顾虑，最终他决定尝试看看。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，刘夏俊成了国内第一支男子“地偶”团体“搬砖汪汪队”的队长。该团体一共有六名成员，其中有学生，也有朝九晚五的打工人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘夏俊透露，团队的排练时间一般定在晚上九点以后，大家都很努力地相互磨合。 “舞台方面，我还是按照曾经（创造营时期）的要求去要求自己的，甚至要比以前更好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;5月27日，“搬砖汪汪队”顺利迎来了首次演出。刘夏俊还清楚地记得，当天有许多从《创造营2019》播出时就开始喜欢自己的粉丝到场给自己应援打call，这让他非常感动：“很多4年前的粉丝到现在还是很支持我，陪伴了我很久。那一瞬间我真的觉得我做对了这件事，没有辜负他们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一名曾经的“地上偶像”，在转向“地下”的过程中，刘夏俊也在慢慢地适应调整新身份，不断学习新技能，比如在演出结束后的“特典会”上要如何与粉丝们近距离交流、应该和大家聊些什么话题；当有粉丝倾诉生活烦恼时该如何与他们沟通；在“切”（照片）上签名涂鸦时应该画些什么图案……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/120132533396b7f88e39091203bc3585.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/120132533396b7f88e39091203bc3585.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255301&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除此之外，在刘夏俊看来，做“地偶”更独特的地方在于，他可以从粉丝那里收获更直观、更具体、更即时的反馈。偶像与粉丝之间的关系从偏单向的输出，变成了双向互动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在参加《创造营》的时候，我知道有人喜欢我，但&#39;粉丝&#39;更像是个概念，是带着一定距离感的。但是在做地下偶像的时候，我能够非常清楚地知道是谁在为我应援，昵称、形象，甚至她的情绪、她的故事。我可以知道大家为什么会喜欢上我，我今天的演出有什么不够好的地方。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当被问及“什么样的人适合做地偶”时，刘夏俊同样提到了“情绪价值”这个词。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得要做地下偶像，必须得是一个非常真诚的人。你要热爱这个工作，尊重这个工作，真诚地去面对所有支持你的人。唱跳能力可以不断成长，但态度是最重要的。”他谈到自己对“偶像”这份职业的理解，“偶像的职责就是让粉丝开心，要给粉丝带来好的能量，（向他们提供）&#39;情绪价值&#39;对一个偶像来说是大过一切的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“地下偶像”的未来在哪？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;对话演出运营方&amp;amp;团体制作人&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;除了像刘夏俊这样拥有舞台经验的艺人以外，还有大量热爱唱跳舞台的素人在近年加入了“地偶”这个行业。但需要注意的是，地下偶像作为一个兴起不久的产业，目前尚未发展至成熟阶段。不少相关报道都不约而同地提及，绝大部分地下偶像的收入情况并不可观，大多数“地偶”都在以兼职的形式“为爱发电”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘夏俊向记者透露，自己从一开始就没有将“地偶”视作一种挣钱方式，“其实（现在）大部分收入还是靠做舞蹈老师和舞团演出，地下偶像这份工作更多的是出于一种热爱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拥有一定粉丝基础的刘夏俊尚且无法仅通过做“地偶”来养活自己，何况那些需要从零开始积攒人气的素人偶像。虽然越来越多的人正在加入其中，但以当前的受众规模，“地偶”尚未发展成一个能赖以谋生的稳定职业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于2021年开始从事主办“地偶”演出的小刘（化名）告诉记者，自己一直将“地偶”团体当作真正的商演艺人来对待，如果邀请他们参与拼盘演出，就会报销其差旅费用，确保来演出的团体不亏本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&#39;特典会&#39;我们要分一些成，但会保证你只要来了就有一定收入。”小刘透露，这样的操作方式与行业内大部分情况不同，“其他演出主办方基本都是让你自己承担演出成本，但基本上大部分人（在特典会上的收入）是负担不了自己差旅费的，所以做团体很容易赔钱，也会造成（地偶的）收入很不稳定。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/a17d7695c9f01ab1fb67614e8a3d3049.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;636&quot;

&lt;p>;“我们感觉有很多孩子，可能是未成年或刚成年，还有刚毕业的大学生，他们完全不知道社会险恶的一面，会被人骗，白白地给别人打工，拿到的分成非常少。”小刘还透露有些公司甚至会私吞活动方提供的差旅补贴，“让主办方报销酒店费，实际上给成员住青年旅舍。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小刘希望通过制作团体，找到真正有潜力的“地偶”成员，同时也能为他们提供相对好一些的待遇，保障他们的生活基础。 “我们会给他们报销所有演出的差旅费，还包括日常排练、服装、做歌等等费用，都由我们来承担，给他们的分成收入也会比业内普遍水平高一些。”小刘告诉记者，目前除了“地偶”外，他还从事着其他方面的业务，相关收入也在支撑着他继续做地下偶像，“因为我们不是指着这个（地偶）挣钱，所以只要不是赔得特别狠，我们就可以做。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;地下偶像作为一种舶来文化，还面临着本土化落地的考验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;粉丝小章在接受采访时提到，当前不少“地偶”团体的演出内容仍以翻唱日本地下偶像的歌曲为主，即便是原创曲目，也有不少是日语歌。 “（演出翻唱）版权问题肯定是有的，但可能是因为（国外的版权方）也很难来国内追溯。”小刘告诉记者，自己的团体也在筹备中文填词的原创歌曲，来丰富演出内容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了演出内容的本土化，“地偶”行业在迅速的发展和扩张中还存在着诸多问题，比如受众的多元化。小刘在接受采访时提到，当前国内的“地偶”受众，有很大一部分人都是从别的文化圈层中“爬墙”过来的，他们的审美取向、追星习惯五花八门，该如何兼容共处？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再比如，他深知这个行业需要相关条约来规范，但其也直言：“它本身是一个&#39;地下文化&#39;，如果用&#39;地上&#39;的方式过多干预，可能就没有大家喜爱的那种自由度了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在不少像小章这样的粉丝“希望更多人可以了解、接受这个小众文化”的同时，也有许多人提出质疑和担忧：将“地偶”推广出圈，在某种程度上与“地偶”的本质似乎是相悖的……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管一切还在摸索之中，有待我们逐步改善以达到某种平衡。但值得肯定的是，正在自由生长、迅速扩张的“地下偶像”，在内娱选秀停摆的当下，为遇冷的偶像行业提供了一种新的机遇与可能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;它让我们看到“追星”不仅是粉丝对偶像的仰慕和追随、对亲密关系的构建和想象，也是双向的、平等的、共创的。明确的营业规则与近距离的互动体验，让享受舞台的偶像也能看清台下众人的模样，让粉丝的付出得到真实而具体的回应。在“地下偶像”的世界里，“双向奔赴”更容易兑现。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;电影取材自1993年的“中俄列车大劫案”，将中国的真实历史案件与商业类型元素结合，已经开发成功的先例有《湄公河行动》和《红海行动》。 《莫斯科行动》在电影工业化方面颇有追求，耗时半年多还原当年俄罗斯的诸多真实场景，将地下水宫、中俄列车换轨站、火箭基地1:1呈现出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;制片人桂侑铭说，当时制作团队刚看完《拆弹专家2》不久，很喜欢这部影片，“跟我们想要的好像有点相似”。如果放在1980年代，这个人选可能会是吴宇森或麦当雄。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时，（联合）监制刘德华帮忙递了剧本，邱礼涛看完很快作了决定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自1980年代进入香港电影工业开始，邱礼涛在片场担任过摄影、剪辑、编剧、导演，几乎涵盖所有工种。他极为高产，执导过近八十部电影，横跨动作片、警匪片、犯罪片、恐怖片、喜剧片、爱情片等等，与此同时，摄影出身的他也时常成为其他香港导演的“救火队员”，口碑极好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年，包括国庆档上映的《莫斯科行动》，中国内地上映了邱礼涛拍摄的《扫毒3》《绝地追击》《暗杀风暴》等四部电影，还有数部影片已经拍摄完成等待上映。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;港片落寞，邱礼涛却片约不断。 2019年的《扫毒2：天地对决》和2020年的《拆弹专家2》均取得超过13亿元的票房，为近年来港产片罕见的票房成绩，《拆弹专家2》更是当年的救市之作，位列2022年豆瓣评分最高的十部华语影片之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;邱礼涛一度被视为港片复兴的中流砥柱——他在香港电影工业体系的黄金年代经历过严苛的训练和塑造，并在行业低谷期始终坚持很高的拍片频率，到今天还能给观众带来“最原汁原味的港片”。但2023年暑期档，邱礼涛的三部影片票房成绩均不理想，《绝地追击》耗资一亿元，票房却不足三千万元，为他惹来“烂拍”“行活导演”的非议。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和邱礼涛导演见面是在2023年9月底。北京大望路附近酒店的一个小套间里，邱礼涛一头长发，穿了一件黑夹克。和惯常不同，他没有穿带摇滚元素的T恤衫。视频拍摄的仪器搭了好一会儿，摄像出身的邱礼涛没有上前搭手，而是靠在窗边休息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;采访中，他声音洪亮，带着微笑，有问必答。听到不明白的普通话词汇，就指一指记者面前的笔记本，“你写给我看看”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Fi95Cw8gIzFhHf8WqseP9Fp9EN2whwQpmotkgBQa.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月底，邱礼涛在北京接受南方周末记者采访，他谈到自己“十年前就想拍奥本海默的故事”，还想拍肖斯塔科维奇和昂山素季的故事。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南瓜视业供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;邱礼涛对南方周末记者说，《扫毒2》和《拆弹专家2》取得成功后，找他拍片的数量其实和过去一样多。即使香港电影光景困顿时，都有人找他拍戏。 “说数量，以前少一点，但是也不少，也不少的意思就是我接不完，我还是有一些要推。但是这几年找我拍的都是大制作，差别在这里。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“超人”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;桂侑铭与邱礼涛第一次见面是在西双版纳。当时，他和编剧陈大明带着《莫斯科行动》的剧本前去，还在拍另一部戏的邱礼涛已事先做好功课，拿着笔记本，逐条谈自己的想法，最主要的意见是缩减剧本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1993年的中俄列车大劫案曾轰动一时，苏联解体后，承担中俄经济往来的K3列车上运载着无数“跨国倒爷”，抢劫、强奸案频频发生。编剧陈大明亲历过那段历史，记得当时电话亭里聊的全是倒卖彩电、吉普车。 1992年，他到莫斯科待过六个月，亲眼见过戴着苏联卫国战争勋章的老人在乞讨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;邱礼涛希望还原那个年代的人和风貌。电影里的警察和劫匪都是背井离乡的人，长久以来，他都想拍摄中国人在外漂泊的题材。比如当年到北美和马来西亚的劳工。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/u4MErr0xLRjh1yKi9hfAxF515WvyRbCtGwP3fesB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/u4MErr0xLRjh1yKi9hfAxF515WvyRbCtGwP3fesB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255318&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;中俄列车大劫案发生的年代和其中漂泊海外的中国人故事，都吸引着邱礼涛执导电影《莫斯科行动》。图为该片剧照。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（片方供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《莫斯科行动》拍摄期间，桂侑铭近距离体会到邱礼涛团队的效率。如果开机时间是早上8点半，他的车通常8点15分到，“他一下车，Jason（执行导演温振威）就跑上去跟他说，导演这个是这样摆的，那个是那样摆的。”8点半准时开机第一个镜头，“然后拍、拍、拍”，中餐半小时，“继续拍、拍、拍”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，新冠疫情仍在蔓延。桂侑铭记得，邱礼涛没有感染过新冠病毒，只感冒过一次。从7月拍到10月初，拍六休一，基本上每天在剧组工作14小时，“完全是超人”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电影研究者、影评人开寅是邱礼涛的影迷，2021年初夏，他到云南西双版纳的《绝地追击》剧组探过班。让开寅印象深刻的是，邱礼涛滴酒不沾，即使制片人和投资方来了也只喝白水。吃完饭，他到点离席，说第二天还要拍戏。 “我想象不出来他是怎么和人打交道的……不会让人觉得别扭，大家还觉得他挺和蔼的，也愿意投钱给他做片子。他肯定有一些自己在社交上或者为人处事上比较有意思的技巧。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“邱导我可以代表他说话：&#39;不好意思，我拍戏的时候不喝酒的，OK？当然不是我不喜欢喝，只是拍戏的时候我不喝酒，OK？&#39;”桂侑铭向南方周末记者解释，“邱导很诚恳地说这些，大家都很OK的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在桂侑铭看来，另一个导演和团队需要150天才能完成的任务，邱礼涛可能只需99天。他拍过近百部电影，“恐怖片、动作片、文戏什么都拍过”，再加上是摄影出身，对于镜头的摆放、团队的合作了然于心，很少需要在现场停下来想一想，也很少补拍重拍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《莫斯科行动》里有一场戏剧冲突很强的歌剧院戏，涉及复杂的镜头调度。台上有七十多人奏交响乐，台下还有七百多名群众演员，演员在其中走来走去，但邱礼涛每一个镜头都两三条就搞定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我说导演你要不要再拍几条，他说不需要，有了。将来剪出来就是很好，没有浪费。”桂侑铭说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们不用担心拍的东西是有用还是没用。如果每天都在担心任务没完成，或者花了太多钱了，或者花的钱跟出来的东西完全不匹配，那还有什么空间把东西做得更好。”桂侑铭解释，这就是为什么很多投资方认为跟邱礼涛合作压力会小很多的原因“用到的每一分钱一定会在银幕上展示出来，没有任何交学费的可能性”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在西双版纳现场，开寅感受到一种邱礼涛高效的调度能力。后者经常会在大脑里同时运转好几件事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如拍这个镜头时，会想那边山上的特效，下一场戏车怎么走。有一场戏，前方三四十米在拍警匪激战的枪战场面，他同时在为另一个洪水从山上冲下来的画面实验水的流量和放水位置。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每当前方的枪战戏喊“cut”，帐篷里的邱礼涛就撩开帘子，拿着对讲机指示山上的工作人员放水，测试效果，等到前面的机位布光调好了，他又把帐篷关上拍下一场，争分夺秒。到了下午，水的位置调整好了，摄影机便马上挪过去拍这个镜头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;搏命&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;1981年至1984年，邱礼涛在香港浸会大学传理学院读电影。他最初学新闻，因为受到《总统班底》（港译《惊天大阴谋》，根据水门事件揭发人自传改编的经典电影）影响，想成为调查记者，翌年受到老师影响，转修电影。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那个年代，同学们毕业前都向往去香港电台实习。因为香港电台电视部拍制的电视节目《狮子山下》（张敏仪、许鞍华等执导），是每一个电影系学生都梦想拍出的作品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;邱礼涛也去香港电台面试过，没有成功。他去学校安排的亚洲电视当助理编导，上了一天班，就被告知不用来了。邱礼涛小时候得过小儿麻痹症，行动不便，后来才知道，这是电视台体谅他的“一番好意”。经过几位老师力荐，他才得以继续上班。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果连实习三个月的能力都要因为身体状况被怀疑，日后要进入电影圈，只能搏命。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;入行之后，邱礼涛做过摄影助理，后来成为黄泰来导演的摄影师。 “香港电影工业1960年代起飞的时候，形成的是一个片场学徒制度。”开寅向南方周末记者介绍。正如纪录片《龙虎武师》中展示的那样，在动作戏占主导的香港电影黄金年代，大量武行都是贫苦清寒出身，没有机会读书，依靠体力和血汗维持着“东方好莱坞”的运转。邱礼涛是当时行业里少有的大学生，但他很快投入高强度的劳动证明自己。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1980年代当摄影师时，邱礼涛试过搬一支灯上小山坡，如果是2.5K，话事人便问够不够光，不要等会儿又要换。如果搬支4K的，他们可能又说，4K那么重，2.5K的就好，来回折腾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和南方周末记者见面这天，邱礼涛走路跨步极大。这也许是一种常年形成的习惯，开寅解释，在胶片年代，一个35毫米胶片的胶片盒本身就有好几公斤重，摄影师常常扛着十几公斤东西在运动，而且手不能抖，“我很难想象他是怎么做到这一点的……他肯定是比别人做得更勤奋”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《莫斯科行动》的动作指导李忠志出身成家班，是香港著名动作指导，多次获得香港电影金像奖、台湾电影金马奖最佳动作设计奖。他和邱礼涛1980年代就在片场认识，一个是武行，一个是摄影指导，用他的话说，邱礼涛是“比一个腿脚方便的人还要走得快的人”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他向南方周末记者回忆，2000年后，邱礼涛有一次在喜马拉雅山拍片，“那个地方空气很稀薄，走路不能快，一快就很快没气。可是拍完一个镜头，就看到他在雪地里一个人跑，下个镜头之后，又马上开始走下去”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也是邱礼涛经历过的年代对他的塑造。巅峰时期，香港电影年产量超过两百部，美国学者大卫·波德维尔在《香港电影的秘密》中形容，这个六百万人居住的城市，拥有全球规模数一数二的电影王国，“输出的电影之多，只仅次于美国”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1980年代至1990年代前半期香港电影工业高速运转时期，参与者工作量巨大。最近一次采访中，邱礼涛说那时可以三天不睡觉，每天放饭那15分钟补觉，撑过醒来后的10分钟就好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得邱礼涛在1980年代经受的这种训练是很重要的，而且他比别人更清楚，你要在这么特殊的电影环境里一直处于上升状态，只有做得更有效率才行。所以他的口碑从1980年代末作为摄影师开始就是以效率见长，能一次过绝不两次。”开寅解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“才艺有限”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;正式入行前，邱礼涛向往拍摄的《黄土地》和《童年往事》这样的电影，但他很快明白这在香港当时的环境中是不被允许的。开寅形容那时普遍的行业氛围不是追求艺术品质和思想表达，“商业电影就是一个商业产品”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了1990年代下半期，受亚洲金融危机、盗版盛行、好莱坞冲击等多重因素影响，香港电影开始走向衰落。拍完《阴阳路》系列后，邱礼涛有过一段心理低潮。他向南方周末记者解释，这就好像在内地影视工业里，忽然一段时间某种类型题材——比如古装、穿越不能开工了，那么这些从业者会面临紧张和不安——他担心再没下部电影可拍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;行业低谷期，邱礼涛完成了具有作者表达的电影。那时，观众已经对传统的动作、武侠题材电影感到乏味，1990年代，作为制片人的李修贤开发了用更低成本拍摄血腥三级片的奇案系列。 1993年，邱礼涛的代表作《八仙饭店之人肉叉烧包》上映，这部影片和《的士判官》和《伊波拉病毒》后来被称为“香港Cult片变态三部曲”，但是三级片的商业类型元素隐含着作者对香港社会底层和边缘者的关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得这个题材帮了邱礼涛很大的忙，他意识到可以做点不一样的，因为人物本身很出挑，题材非常冷血，或者非常残酷。”开寅说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于工多艺熟，邱礼涛这时已经在大量小成本实践中磨练出一套“经济美学”。开寅解释，摄影师出身的邱礼涛，懂得怎样用摄影机的运动和角度去弥补制景和服化道的成本缺陷。 “邱礼涛让所有人的脑子都转了一下机，我们不用拍像成龙似的满香港开着车到处追、到处撞才能吸引观众……你只需要给我一个意念性的暴力就能代替刺激。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;影评人林震宇认为，自《八仙饭店之人肉叉烧包》开始，“邱礼涛部分定性为较激烈的社会问题电影里，集中处理、展现极端血腥画面，对生命的折磨（包括人和动物）毫不留情，他九十年代初期的电影志达到一个疯狂失控的状态，九十年代末至2000年的电影，则把残酷化为黑暗的讽刺符号”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开寅认为，贯穿邱礼涛不同片子的核心基点是一个发自本能的愤怒情绪。这可能来自他受到摇滚乐、无政府主义运动的文化影响，但对于观众来说，这是一种对日常生活的解脱。 “你可能在日常生活中积累了很多愤怒或不满，没有办法以正常的形式发泄出来，你看一部电影，这种情绪被有目的地释放出来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年，邱礼涛在香港岭南大学取得文学研究博士学位。在《一个电影导演的文化思考与实践》一书中，邱礼涛曾解释，他称为“拍电影作为文化研究”的想法萌生于1980年代末。他正身处澳门为一部商业电影卖命，“那一刻我在想：为什么要拍电影？电影应该有更多可能性……于是，我拍了一些电影：关于被人视为&#39;厌恶性&#39;行业的殡仪从业员故事《阴阳路3之升棺发财》、关于边缘青少年的《给他们一个机会》和关于被歧视社群的《性工作者十日谈》。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《拆弹专家2》也是将商业动作片与社会表达结合成功的范例。一位观众在豆瓣网这样形容这部电影：你能看出它的主创经历过严苛而完整的工业化训练，不让人疲倦，还有恰如其分的爽。如果深挖，又给你思考人和社会、正义与邪恶关系的空间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在南方周末记者的采访中，邱礼涛回应了许多外界的争议。谈到1年内有4部戏密集上映，他说这在香港过去是常事，曾经同一天电影院里有3部他的电影在上，“观众都习惯了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他反驳烂拍的说法，并认为说他赶工并不准确。他抬一抬头回忆，挨着数——“《暗杀风暴》是2018年拍的、《扫毒3》是2021年拍的、《莫斯科行动》是2022年拍的、《绝地追击》是2021年拍的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你可以说我有些multitask，同时做很多东西……可是《绝地追击》我们弄这个剧本弄了一年多，如果出来都不好，这是我们的才艺有限，我也可以承认，但是花的时间不是人家想象得那么短，也跟其他的制作一样得长。能够快一点我希望能再快一点，能多拍一点就多拍一点。”邱礼涛说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;同行者&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在邱礼涛的故事里，似乎很难绕开他的同伴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的搭档多是这个行业里的老“法师”，除了李忠志，摄影指导陈广鸿曾担任《英雄本色》的摄影师，也是邱礼涛的多年搭档，从《阴阳路》《竞雄女侠秋瑾》……一路合作至《莫斯科行动》，他年过七旬，“在现场跑来跑去，像个年轻人一样。”桂侑铭说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开寅形容邱礼涛团队有种异乎寻常的默契，甚至很难知道他们之间是怎么沟通的。因为他们很少说话，却对彼此的需求心领神会。合作多年，李忠志知道邱礼涛需要的是真实的质感，《莫斯科行动》中有一场人从火车里摔出去的镜头，原本剧本里没有，邱礼涛便询问，如果加进去，对你的整套动作设计有没有影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“摔出去第一会好看，第二震撼性更大，对观众有点刺激。”李忠志理解邱礼涛的意思，于是在火车里走来走去，考虑设计什么动作更合理。 “那个玻璃那么小，又要合理地摔出去，最后想的就是在火车包间里撞那个门，门砸碎玻璃，那个人被推出去。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/yoUie951kErBJFzaNXG2Th8X9sAhQvMpUAQLa5d9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/yoUie951kErBJFzaNXG2Th8X9sAhQvMpUAQLa5d9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255317&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;电影《莫斯科行动》开头的列车打斗戏，融入了邱礼涛的临场创意。图为该片剧照。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（片方供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李忠志是陈木胜导演的黄金搭档，他认为两位导演很像，都是可以“拍戏不睡觉的人”。区别在于陈木胜导演会把人“榨到最干”，邱礼涛的方式则更温和。在片场，桂侑铭发现即便十分熟悉，刘德华和邱礼涛却总是小声交流，有商有量，“非常之专业”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今李忠志的武行演员几乎都是内地人，现在香港的武行少，“慢慢都断层了”。他拍戏时，有时十个月都在怀柔。新冠疫情期间，执行导演温振威长期帮邱礼涛处理在内地的工作，时间长了，团队的一位前辈说，这两年见他比见自己的妻子都多，“慢慢大家就很像一个大家庭”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在行业的寒冬，一些人会承袭着过往的专业，也在共同体中汲取温暖。邱礼涛曾说：“有班底就要保证一直有工作，没有频密的工作，很难能凑成自己的班底。所以有时为了维持班底，只要不太违背原则的工作，也会接来做。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从这个意义上讲，开寅认为邱礼涛也许拍过质量平庸的电影，但他不认为是烂片——因为他的态度是认真的，没有刻意糊弄片方、糊弄观众。 “正因为有邱礼涛这样的导演，他在不断地开工拍片，不断地把新人纳入这个工业，才能逐渐把他们培养成人才，并以此维持香港电影工业的基本运作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;温振威2014年毕业于香港浸会大学，从基础的场务做起，逐渐成为邱礼涛的执行导演。工作当中，邱礼涛向后辈反复强调，“先不要学那些花里胡哨的东西”，“比如做副导演，你要懂看剧本，拆剧本，你要懂很多事为什么这样安排那样安排，先把这方面的功夫练好”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;邱礼涛成长于胶片年代，他会告诉后辈，胶片年代的遗产之一便是不能乱拍，因为一开机就是钱。 “邱导经常跟我们说一个概念，就是我们不要觉得现在预算充足，就可以很随意。我们还是要保持精准，把钱花在刀刃上。”温振威说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我幸运的是拍片数量比较多，但如果你问代表性（导演），我很信服的有，但我觉得我还不是，起码对大部分电影影迷来说，我肯定不是香港最优秀的导演”，他向南方周末记者坦言，这几年想拍好片的欲望比以前大很多。因为以前怕没得拍，怕别人觉得这个行业在走下坡路；可是拍出来票房不好，被观众骂，作为导演不是没有感觉，但不会抑郁跳楼。但现在他会觉得，电影比人长寿，“你不要留一些不好的东西在世界上”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么一直保持这么强烈的拍片动力，邱礼涛的答案常常是在片场充实，感觉在“活着”。他向南方周末记者回忆，1980年代刚入行时，因为身体缘故，妈妈总担心他在外面工作很辛苦，“可是她不知道我在片场里面很多人照顾”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大卫·波德维尔认为香港电影创造了1970年代以来全球最富于生气和想象力的大众电影。当南方周末记者问，最想拍的好电影是什么样的？邱礼涛回答了四个字——雅俗共赏。 &lt;/p>;
