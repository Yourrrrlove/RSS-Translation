In such a long process, the ups and downs, grievances and resentments between China and the United States are a very complicated record. Since China switched to welcoming the world, the entanglement between China and the United States is probably more complicated than the relationship between China and any other country in history, and has far-reaching consequences. &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div >;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被渴慕的军训丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259426]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh57DFsDOpHt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh 57DFsDOpHt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangxi Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology 2023 freshmen military training demonstration&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.infzm.com/contents/258988&quot; title=&quot;How is hard-core military training accomplished&quot;>;How is hard-core military training accomplished&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interview with Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidian&quot;&lt;/span>;) and Guilin Institute of Aerospace Industry (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guihang&quot;&lt;/span>;) as a person in charge of military training, I wanted to understand the difficulties of organizing hard-core military training, but I always failed to do so. The two schools borrowed simulated weapons and combat vehicles without much trouble. The tactical training seemed to come naturally. The local garrison area and military training and education base are willing to open their doors to the school and can deliver realistic equipment and a sufficient number of active or retired military personnel to the new students participating in the training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in addition to these objective factors, I feel that there is a strong spiritual power that allows the hard-core military training in these two universities in Guangxi to be implemented smoothly. In the minds of students participating in special warfare training, military training is not an obligation that is forced to be completed, but a life experience that is desired. One kind of person looks forward to the sense of relief when everything ends from the first day of military training; the other kind of person hopes to pursue the intrinsic value of military training and is eager to continue it even after the military training ends. I think that when I participated in military training as a student, I belonged to the former; but many training students in Guilin universities fell into the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Shen Hong was interviewed, he was a little shy. Huang Yilong, chairman of the Patriotic National Defense Education Association, often said that Shen Hong was an outstanding representative of the Red Army&#39;s demining gunners. Upon hearing such compliments, Shen Hong would either bury his head in the ground or look at the street lights in the distance, deliberately hiding his smile from me. Different from the occasional erratic expression, even if the person had already stepped out of the queue, for more than 20 minutes, Shen Hong&#39;s simulated gun was fixed on his chest in a standard gun-holding posture from beginning to end, without moving at all. Two weeks of freshmen military training and two weeks of daily association training seemed to have carved his rock-solid movements into a habit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the hardships of special warfare training, Shen Hong always downplays: &quot;There are bruises on elbows, knees, legs, and feet, but they will be over with some medicine.&quot; &quot;While leaping forward, I suddenly heard something The body cannot react to the enemy&#39;s instructions on the left and right, so I keep practicing this movement and practice harder. I will do it wrong at first, but after practicing for three or four days, I can reach the standard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with these, the &quot;soldier&quot; Identity has more appeal to Shen Hong. He was born in Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County, Guangxi. He is a freshman this year and has been following war movies and spy dramas for more than ten years. Recalling the time he spent watching TV with his father, Shen Hong&#39;s tone raised a few notches, &quot;Chinese soldiers are very handsome.&quot; The first time he knew that his father, a farmer, had been a soldier was because he saw his marching kettle. &quot;That&#39;s a unique kettle in the army.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shen Hong is convinced that if he meets the recruitment standards, he will definitely join the army after graduation. For him, this military training is not only a required course according to the syllabus, but also a serious preparatory exercise before officially joining the army. What attracted him to join the tactical company was not only the rich firearms training, but also the &quot;soldier&#39;s pride&quot; that comes with pressure. In Shen Hong&#39;s eyes, his teammates are also &quot;people with a strong sense of family and country, who speak directly and boldly.&quot; &quot;I like to be friends with people who can tell their true feelings.&quot; He also longs for the future life in the military camp: if he is bitten by ants during training on the grass, a comrade will happily hand him a dose of ointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, it was already dark when the Guihang military training performance ended. The special operations team members who had no chance to ride in the armored vehicle during the performance climbed into the armored vehicle one by one in groups of eight or nine. They sat in a small circle on the roof of the car, arms around each other, singing songs as the chariot moved forward. Everyone&#39;s face was covered with tired camouflage makeup, but the singing was still loud. They were like battle-hardened soldiers returning in triumph. Marching to the center of the playground, the armored vehicle suddenly stopped, and the team members staggered, as if they were waking up from a dream. But when they climbed down from the car, they saw other team members sitting cross-legged under the street lamp in the distance, noisy and lively, so they ran over. The WeChat messages, photos, and words of their comrades remained forever in the camouflage-colored dream. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“最后一代务农人”：他们正在消失的技艺、生活方式与价值观]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259340]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the afternoon of the fourth day after returning home during the National Day holiday, my mother and I went for a walk. We met Grandma Yang in a vegetable field near the river. She was planting radish seedlings with her hunched back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother told me that Grandma Yang is 81 years old and is the oldest person in the village. Grandma Yang’s wife has passed away many years ago. Her two sons are developing in Wuhan, the provincial capital, and she lives alone. I saw that there were daikon, carrots, beetroot, and cabbage planted in the field, so I asked Grandma Yang why she planted so many. She said, &quot;Four months later, the children all went home, and together they had 9 mouths.&quot; Zi realized that the Spring Festival would be in four months. She also added, &quot;Not only do they come back to eat during the Chinese New Year, I also have to prepare some for them to take with them when they leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing that the radishes I planted earlier were not growing very well, I asked Why, she told two reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, many farmers have gone to cities to work, many fields are deserted, bushes are everywhere, and there are many more wild boars, badgers and other animals than before. Just like the numbers of people, they have Instead of sneakily eating crops including vegetables at night, they can also freely invade vegetable fields, valleys, and sweet potato fields during the day. During the day, the old man can come to the vegetable fields with a stick from time to time to guard them and drive away wild animals. , at night, she had absolutely no choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, due to the long-term use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers, the soil structure of farmland has changed. The soil has become seriously compacted, fertility has dropped sharply, and the output of various crops, including vegetables, has dropped sharply. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In fact, we can’t go back&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After telling Grandma Yang to be careful, my mother and I continued walking. There was a large field of rice fields in front of me. My mother asked me which one belonged to my family. I guessed twice, but my mother shook her head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I suddenly felt ashamed. I didn’t even know where my own farm was. Probably since I started working in 2008, every time I go home, my parents rarely go to the fields to do farm work, but stay with me. Of course, I rarely have the opportunity to go to the fields. As time went by, I forgot the exact location of the fields at home. Seeing that the rice was golden yellow, I suggested harvesting it the next day and helped cut it. Unexpectedly, my mother was very worried about my rice cutting skills. &quot;It&#39;s better to wait until you return to Guangzhou. Your dad and I will take our time. If you haven&#39;t gone to the fields for many years, it will be bad if you cut your hands.&quot; I was speechless, because the fact is that although I go home often, I rarely work in the fields. I am no longer an important labor force in the family like when I was in elementary school and junior high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I work at a university in Guangzhou. I have a long summer and winter vacation. I go home for many more days every year than other young people in the village. For example, my brother started his working career after dropping out of school in his second year of high school at the age of 17. He basically works outside all year round, except for about half a month when he goes home during the Spring Festival. My brother is 44 years old and has been working for 27 years. Now, he has bought a house in Wuhan, and his sister-in-law and two nephews also live in Wuhan permanently. The eldest nephew is studying in college, and the sister-in-law takes care of the younger nephew who is in elementary school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, my family of four is in Guangzhou, and my brother’s family of four is in Wuhan. We have all been actively or passively involved in the wave of urbanization, and it is difficult for us to return. The hometown is developed or settled. In fact, we can&#39;t go back because we are no longer an &quot;agricultural population&quot; and have been engaged in &quot;non-agricultural industries&quot;, which has nothing to do with my brother&#39;s household registration in his hometown. No matter whether we enjoy the various benefits or treatment of authentic Guangzhou or Wuhan citizens, we are already veritable (new) Guangzhou people or (new) Wuhan people. Guangzhou or Wuhan is our permanent residence, and it is the place where we and our children A place to eat, drink, have sex, and have basic necessities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My brother and I are born in the 1970s. What are the people born in the 80s and 90s who are younger than us in the village doing? Where now? A small number of people have left their hometowns by studying, but most of them, like my brother, work outside all year round. What they have in common is that they are away from home all year round, and they only come home for ten and a half days during the Chinese New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are those born in the 1960s who are older than us doing? There are eight people born in the 1960s in my village. Four of them went to the city to work with their children, either taking care of their grandchildren who were in school or working for their sons who were construction workers. Two of them opened decoration companies, starting in Wuhan and Xining respectively. The last two are in the education industry. One is a teacher at a university in Wuhan, and the other is the principal of a village primary school in his hometown. It is not difficult to see that the eight people born in the 1960s have basically left the countryside and agriculture, and they all only go home during the Chinese New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people born in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s have all moved into the city and are currently working hard in the city. Do they have any plans or signs of returning to the village in the future? I feel minimal. They have been in the city for many years, and their food, culture, and habits have already been highly urbanized. The post-80s and post-90s generations have experienced the rinsing of urbanization. They can no longer live without these things in shopping malls, KTVs, cinemas, fast food, and game arcades. Even Uncle Xia, who was born in 1962, said, &quot;Although I have been farming in my hometown for more than 20 years, I am no longer used to going home because life in my hometown is too inconvenient and the city is too convenient.&quot; In Northeast China Brother Wen, who works part-time, also mentioned, &quot;The winter at home is too cold and I am not used to it. I have stayed in Harbin for 32 years. Although the outdoor temperature is low, the indoors are heated and very comfortable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Farmers Vs Peasants&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It goes without saying that the only people who are still farming in their hometowns are those born in the 1940s like Grandma Yang, and those born in the 1950s like my parents. As children have gone to the city to go to school, many women have also joined the migrant workers, and the post-60s generation who went out to make a living in the early 1980s have adapted greatly to urban life. In the past, the &quot;386199&quot; army, which mainly constituted the rural population , now only the lonely &quot;99&quot; is left, and the corresponding specific groups are those born in the 40s and 50s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I would like to express that this group of people is truly the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot;. In particular, the author does not use the concept of &quot;farmers&quot;. In my opinion, concepts such as &quot;farmers&quot; and &quot;workers&quot; have distinct political and identity attributes. In the context of the use of the word &quot;farmers&quot;, there are often several contrasting groups, such as &quot;which group does farmers correspond to?&quot; &quot;Farmers are in rural areas, and workers are In the city&quot;, this is not the case. In essence, they are just differences in industry or professional division of labor. There are no political or identity differences or oppositions. A similar situation exists with the word &quot;worker&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As times have changed, we are more willing to use concepts that are familiar and easier for ordinary people to accept, such as &quot;migrant workers&quot;, &quot;migrant workers&quot;, &quot;migrant girls&quot;, &quot;farmers&quot; and &quot;migrant workers&quot;. Whether they are &quot;farmers&quot; or &quot;laborers,&quot; they are all industrial workers/laborers in the true sense of the word. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The skills of farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As &quot;farmers&quot;, this group of elderly people are naturally well versed in various techniques and techniques of farming or rural areas and agriculture. They have been familiar with agricultural seasons since they were young. , know when to spring plow, when to raise seedlings, when to sow seeds, when to fertilize, when to weed, when to harvest, and what to use to store crops. They know how to use ashes from stoves or firewood piles as fertilizer, and they also know how to use human, chicken, pig and other manure as an important supplement for crop nutrients, instead of just relying on pesticides or chemical fertilizers to improve soil fertility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They will use the corner land in front of and behind the house to grow some vegetables, or reclaim idle or abandoned land in the mountains that is full of rocks or has been deserted for a long time to grow things. Before building a house or choosing a cemetery, they would ask Feng Shui masters to take a look; they invented bamboo beds for cooling in the summer, drying cages for heating in the winter, and chamber pots for using the toilet at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of them have been standard rural craftsmen since they were young, such as blacksmiths, painters, oilers, carpenters, quilters, tailors, midwives, barefoot doctors, fortune tellers, and witch doctors. When the village was renovated, they reminded young people not to easily remove the ancient trees at the entrance of the village, and strongly recommended that the old ancestral hall in the center of the village be retained. When family members have stomachaches, diarrhea, or other three diseases and two pains, they will go to the fields to find Houttuynia cordata and mugwort leaves, and use them to soak their feet, bathe, smoke them, or boil them in water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is no exaggeration to say that there are countless skills that they are familiar with or master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the vast majority of them have a very low level of education, with a high proportion of illiterates or semi-illiterates, but this does not hinder their deep understanding and familiarity with agricultural technology, rural memories and agricultural civilization. They may have never spoken about circular economy, ecological agriculture, intensive and economical land use, intangible cultural heritage, etc. in textbooks or propaganda slogans, nor do they know how to express them, but they have been practicing them all their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This illustrates the truth that culture and civilization often or usually have little or not much to do with educational level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot; has made significant contributions to the inheritance of agricultural technology, the continuation of agricultural civilization, the harmony of families, and the country&#39;s urbanization and modernization. It is they who have succeeded their forefathers and ancestors, passing on from generation to generation, that agricultural civilization can be carried forward and passed on; it is they who guard their hometowns and rear areas so that their children and their younger generations can enter the city calmly and confidently Work hard to create a new life for the new generation; it is the kindness and hard work of them and their children that created the miracle of China&#39;s low-cost industrialization, urbanization and modernization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The lifestyle and values ​​of farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In terms of lifestyle, the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot; generally have a thrifty character, such as eating as little as possible and eating as much as possible. How many people eat leftovers for pigs, dogs, chickens and other livestock and poultry? Although they are very pleased with the various express delivery out of filial piety and respect for their children, they occasionally complain. They feel that their children spend money like water and spend money lavishly. . The acquisition and cultivation of thrifty character is certainly related to the most difficult and difficult years they experienced, but in that era of extreme material poverty, without frugality and frugality, there was no way to achieve the accumulation of material and wealth, as well as capital accumulation. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;capital accumulation&quot; here can be understood as &quot;without money, unable to pay tuition, even if the children are admitted to college, they will not be able to go to college. As a rural person, the biggest ambition is to &#39;jump out of the farm gate&#39; , as well as the future glory of the family and the glory of the ancestors, naturally they cannot be fulfilled.&quot; The assumption of the above statement is that children are the most important investment area of ​​the family, the expenditure on raising children is the investment cost, and the future development and returns of the children are investment income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of values, the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot; are very &quot;selfless&quot; and &quot;selfless&quot; to the extreme. The whole meaning of their lives lies in contribution and dedication. Many of them spend most of their lives or their entire lives living for others and their families. They have gone through untold hardships and have been stuck to the land all their lives. They have never or rarely left their hometowns and have been doing farm work all their lives. The so-called &quot;face to the loess and back to the sky&quot; accurately refers to their generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of them have been the main labor force in their families since they were young. They work hard and save all their lives, build houses, marry and have children, and then live frugally to raise their children and provide them with education. When the children grow up, they still think about Give your children a subsidy to share the pressure of buying a house in the city or getting married and starting a family. A few people even endured the torture of acculturation and still chose to go to the city to cook for their children and take their grandchildren to and from school when they were in their twenties. Only when their grandchildren were older could they return home to the home they had been used to all their lives. . After returning home, they finally no longer have to be busy, but they find that they have already fallen ill. Some people choose not to tell their children because they are afraid of using their children&#39;s money. Some people simply do not go to the hospital for a physical examination, fearing that if the problem is found, it will cause trouble for their children. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since they are the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot;, they are the &quot;last generation&quot;. Just like many villages that have experienced and are experiencing decline and decline, the torrent of the times will not pity them because of their hard work or hardship. them, or keep them. The exit of the old and the emergence of the new has always been an inevitable law of historical development and evolution, and no one can stop it. We can feel desolate, but we still need to let go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[胡适之父胡铁花之死真相]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259328]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/26/cmE0watQ4X4hR3EdC4BMdX1zy6V3ZcKH0xoxzto7.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/cmE0watQ4X4hR3EdC4BMdX1zy6V3ZcKH0 xoxzto7. png&quot; data-key=&quot;255537&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Chuan (Hao Tiehua), the father of Hu Shi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1895, the Qing government ceded Taiwan. Hu Shi&#39;s father, Hu Chuan, was the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture at the time. Hu Shi recalled that his father was &quot;unable to &quot;Willing to release&quot; delayed medical treatment and died, and most academic circles gave a conclusion of &quot;death from illness&quot;. The author discovered from the diary of Yuan Chang, a disciple of Zhang Zhidong, that Hu Chuan was imprisoned and blackmailed by Liu Yongfu, which worsened his condition and died on the ship back to Xiamen. Liu Yongfu&#39;s final release was the result of Yuan Chang&#39;s request for Zhang Zhidong&#39;s intervention. Yuan Chang was killed in 1900 for speaking out. He was a loyal and upright person, and his record deserves attention. The content of Yuan Chang&#39;s record is consistent with Hu Shi&#39;s recollection, but the wording is slightly different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi&#39;s father&#39;s official name was Hu Chuan, also known as Shousan and Shoushan, also known as Tiehua and Blunt Man. He experienced twists and turns in his life. He went north to Ninggu Pagoda, south to Hainan Li District, and finally arrived in Taiwan. The governor of Dongzhili Prefecture. For a long time, people have been under the impression that Hu Chuan died of illness. Luo Ergang, a disciple of Hu Shi and the famous scholar who compiled &quot;Hu Tiehua&#39;s Manuscripts&quot;, also agrees with this theory. There are many people who hold this view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author also believes that Hu Chuan died of illness, but he died of an aggravation of his illness due to delays in treatment in captivity, and did not die of a normal illness. Hu Shi recalled: &quot;My father was in Taitung in charge of the defense of Houshan. Telegraphs were blocked and his salary source was cut off. At that time, he had suffered from beriberi and could no longer move his left foot. He stayed there until the third day of the fifth lunar month before leaving. Back Mountain, when they arrived in Anping, Liu Yongfu insisted on keeping him for help and refused to let him go. By June 25, he could no longer move his feet, so Liu Yongfu let him go. On June 28, he arrived in Xiamen. He could no longer move, and he died in Xiamen on July 3rd.&quot; (Hu Shi&#39;s &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;) Hu Shi later added: &quot;But in my &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;, I stated that my father&#39;s death was due to beriberi. It can be cured. My father originally wanted to rush to Shanghai to seek medical treatment, but because Liu Yongfu refused to let him go, it was delayed for nearly two months. It was not until he was critically ill that he was let go. He arrived in Xiamen on June 28th and arrived in Xiamen in early July. He died at the age of three. My original intention (and the opinion of my late brother and late mother) is that my late father’s death was due to Liu Yongfu’s refusal to let him go.” (Hu Songping’s “First Draft of the Long Chronicle of Mr. Hu Shizhi”, Volume 1 Page 27) The person accompanying Hu Chuan that day was Hu Shi&#39;s second brother Shaozhi, who was also responsible for carrying the coffin back home. The situation described by Hu Shi should come from his second brother. Hu Shi&#39;s addition is extremely important and is consistent with Yuan Chang&#39;s diary records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Yongfu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading Hu Chuan&#39;s &quot;Taiwan Diary&quot;, he wrote to Tang Jingsong on the 6th of May, requesting &quot;to open a vacancy and return to his hometown for medical treatment&quot; and &quot;recover as soon as he obtains Yuan Shuangqiu&#39;s observation book from South Anhui Province.&quot; This diary entry proves that Hu Chuo&#39;s intention was to return to the mainland for medical treatment, and that he had frequent correspondence with Yuan Chang. Yuan Chang&#39;s official position at this time was Guangtai Road, Ningchi, Anhui Province, referred to as &quot;Wannan Road&quot;. Because he was stationed in Wuhu, he was sometimes referred to as &quot;Wuhu Road&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;, Hu Chuan was &quot;imprisoned and deprived of food&quot; by Liu Yongfu, which caused his condition to worsen. He died on the ship, and only a corpse arrived in Xiamen. Yuan Chang was a student admitted by Zhang Zhidong when he was the deputy chief examiner of Zhejiang Province in his early years. Yuan Chang&#39;s &quot;Diary of a Sanren in Bixietai Mountain&quot; collected in &quot;Diaries of the Past Dynasties&quot; has the same content as Sun Zhimei&#39;s punctuated version of &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;. It is an abridged copy of reading notes and a small number of notes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the diary, in the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896), he met Chen Wenluo (Chen Zhongying) and recalled what happened the previous year. Yuan Chang wrote in 1896: &quot;Chen Zhongying once guarded Tainan. He talked about how his late friend Hu Shousan (biography) was an official in Taitung Prefecture. He asked Liu Yongfu for a bribe of 20,000 yuan for the commander-in-chief Liu Yongfu, but he was not allowed. He was imprisoned and had no food. Yongfu originally surrendered to the thieves. It is a true act of thieves. I went to Xia to beg the governor Zhang Gong to interrogate Liu, and released Huzhou as a pastor. Before crossing the Taiwan Strait to Xiamen, he drank wine on a ship. He was so angry that he could not pursue his ambition and became ill.&quot; (Compiled by Sun Zhimei, &quot;Yuan Chang&quot; (Diary, Volume 2, page 1224) Chen Wenluo was appointed as the prefect of Taipei in 1892. He had never been stationed in Tainan, but he obeyed the order to cross over in May. Chen Wenluo is a colleague of Hu Chuan. His official experience makes his testimony irreplaceable and authoritative, and he is closest to the historical scene. Jiawu and Yiweizhangzhidong were in charge of the governor of Liangjiang, and Wuhu Road was under the governor of Liangjiang. According to the diary, it was Yuan Chang who asked Zhang Zhidong to call Liu Yongfu to release Hu Chuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the governors of the late Qing Dynasty, Zhang Zhidong paid the most attention to Yi Wei&#39;s surrender. Tang Jingsong, the governor of Taiwan, and Liu Yongfu, the assistant commander of Taiwan Defense Nan&#39;ao Town, were all supported and commanded by Zhang Zhidong during the Sino-French War. , Hu Chuanze inspected the Li District of Hainan in 1887 on the order of Zhang Zhidong. These three people all have deep connections with Zhang Zhidong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation in Taiwan during the Yiwei period was very complicated. Zhang Zhidong, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, ostensibly complied with the imperial court&#39;s decision to cede Taiwan. He also secretly supported Tang Jingsong and Liu Yongfu in resisting Japan and protecting Taiwan, and provided money and weapons. However, after receiving a telegram from the imperial court to challenge him, he stopped and left Tang and Liu to their own devices. Decide on orientation. Tang and Liu were originally famous generals who fought against the French, but were misled by their fame. They initially decided to stay in Taiwan to fight against the Japanese. However, their military strength could not last long. Tang Jingsong soon sneaked back to the mainland, while Liu Yongfu was &quot;overshadowed&quot; by others. Liu Yongfu felt that he had been tricked by Zhang Zhidong. When most of the local officials had been transferred inland, it was impossible to detain Hu Chuan, the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture, to demand payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Liu Yongfu cut off support from the mainland, it was a relatively simple way to obtain military pay from local officials. After careful reading of what Chen Wenluo said about &quot;asking for bribes,&quot; I feel that it is more reasonable to interpret it as &quot;asking for salary.&quot; Liu Yongfu detained Hu Chuan and &quot;deprived him of food and drink in captivity.&quot; However, Hu Chuan had no cash in his hands, and it was very difficult to raise wages as the Japanese troops advanced deeper and deeper. Yuan Chang from Wuhu Road asked Zhang Zhidong for help and called Liu Yongfu to release him. Hu Chuan died on the ship returning to Xiamen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Chuan died because he was imprisoned by Liu Yongfu and fasted, which delayed his treatment and his condition worsened. This was not a normal death. During the Sino-French War, Tang Jingsong took the initiative to sneak into Vietnam and fight side by side with Liu Yongfu. He had a deeper understanding of Liu Yongfu. In 1884, he reported to the court through Cen Yuying, the governor of Yunnan and Guizhou, saying that Liu Yongfu &quot;valued wealth too much, treated his subordinates with little kindness, and showed no mercy.&quot; No discipline.&quot; (Page 91 of Volume 1 of &quot;The Telegram of Duke Zhang Wenxiang (Unpublished)&quot;) Linking this phrase with the way he treated Hu Chuan in 1895, another side of Liu Yongfu&#39;s character becomes apparent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在何种情况下，以色列会使用核武器？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259428]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/lPGP575q0cEcOl9oyhbIVi2CCvaUQuFNCyKKvSjE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/lPGP575q0cEcOl9oyhbIVi2CCvaUQuFNCyKK vSjE. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255391&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The northern Gaza Strip was attacked in Sderot, Israel, on October 23, 2023. Thick smoke rising after Israeli air strikes &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Israeli Knesset member &quot;Tali&quot; Gotliff (Revital &quot;Tally&quot; Gotliv) actually told the media that Israel should use nuclear weapons to retaliate against Hamas&#39;s attacks on Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gotliff also wrote on her social media: &quot;Jericho missile! Jericho missile! Strategic alert. Before considering troops entering. Doomsday weapon (used)! This is mine Viewpoint. May God bless us with all our strength.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She later publicly declared that &quot;only an explosion that shook the Middle East can restore this country (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;means Israel&lt;/span>;) dignity, strength and security! It’s time to kiss the end of the world. Launch powerful missiles without limit. Don’t level a neighborhood, smash and level the entire Gaza…nothing Show no mercy! Show no mercy!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, this is an outright nuclear threat. Gottliff is a lawyer and an opponent of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Her remarks have always been known for being extreme and crazy, so her extreme remarks this time were not regarded by anyone as a serious nuclear threat. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we have to admit the fact that Israel is indeed the only country in the Middle East that possesses nuclear weapons, and it almost decided to use nuclear weapons to save the defeat in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there is now a lot of public opinion that if anti-Israel allies such as Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah join the war, Hamas&#39;s goal of completely destroying Israel is expected to be achieved. But even if we do not take into account the fact that the combined conventional military strength of these opponents is still far behind that of Israel, as well as the fact that two US aircraft carriers are within easy reach, and only consider the existence of Israel&#39;s nuclear power, if Israel is completely defeated, this war will be The possibility of escalation to a nuclear war cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So is Israel ready to use nuclear weapons in reality? To answer this question, we first need to understand what kind of nuclear power Israel has and what is the positioning of its nuclear strategy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Israel does not accept the supervision of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Israeli government has always implemented a vague nuclear strategy, neither admitting nor denying the possession of nuclear weapons, and has not announced the deployment of its nuclear weapons to the outside world, the outside world is very concerned. It is difficult to know exactly how many nuclear weapons Israel possesses and whether the nuclear weapons are in a state of war readiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The international arms control research community now generally believes that Israel possesses at least 90 nuclear weapons and also retains key nuclear materials that can produce 200-300 nuclear weapons. Although Israel&#39;s nuclear weapons are very small, it is one of the very few countries with a triad of nuclear strike capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel has the Jericho medium-range ballistic missile with a range that can cover the entire Middle East and parts of Africa and Asia. This system is considered the core of Israel’s land-based nuclear strike force, among which the latest Jericho The Type 3 missile has a range of up to 4,800 kilometers, enough to cover Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, and even Moscow, the capital of Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both the Israeli Air Force’s F-16 and F-15 fighter jets are capable of carrying nuclear bombs. The outside world even generally believes that Israel’s customized F-35 fighter jets will have the ability to drop nuclear bombs. It is expected that the Israeli Air Force’s There are at least 30 aerial nuclear bombs similar to the American B-61 type in the arsenal. This is the core of Israel&#39;s first-hand nuclear strike force. It maintains a very high level of combat readiness and can launch nuclear attacks from the air at any time, posing a threat to surrounding hostile countries. Very big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel is also one of the very few countries with underwater nuclear forces. Although it is not equipped with nuclear-powered submarines, the Dolphin-class conventionally-powered submarines in service in its navy are equipped with nuclear cruise missiles. The Israeli Army and Air Force Even if they no longer exist, the submarine force can still carry out doomsday strike missions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This triad of nuclear strike capabilities enables Israel, despite its small land area, to possess nuclear combat capabilities that surpass those of Britain and France. It is one of the few countries that can carry out preemptive nuclear strikes against major deterrence targets. If Israel really faces the risk of national annihilation, it is very likely to use nuclear weapons at the last moment in a desperate move. In fact, Israel&#39;s nuclear deterrent took shape after the Fourth Middle East War. This was also one of the strategic considerations for secular Arab countries such as Egypt to normalize relations with Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Congressman Gotliff’s statement that nuclear weapons should be used in Gaza is obviously just a personal statement. No matter how crazy Israel is, the radiation fallout after the nuclear explosion is an unacceptable and catastrophic consequence for Israel, which is very close. However, if the war expands and Iran directly participates in the war, then Israel&#39;s use of nuclear weapons is not an impossible option. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, Israel and the United States jointly conducted exercises to attack Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities, and Israel&#39;s combat plan is likely to include the option of launching a nuclear strike against Iran in extreme circumstances. This Hamas attack is generally considered to be the worst situation Israel has encountered after the Yom Kippur War. If Israel had prepared for a nuclear strike in 1973, it is not ruled out that there will be relevant plans this time. What&#39;s worse is that the number and means of use of the Israeli military&#39;s nuclear weapons have now far exceeded those of the past. Therefore, the international community should be alert to the possibility and harm of Israel preparing to use nuclear weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一碗海鲜面和便民热线]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259434]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;During the holidays, my husband and I joined in the fun and went to an island with the outdoor club. When we arrived at the island, it was already lunch time, so let’s look for seafood noodles. Who let seafood noodles be my obsession? I turned into a restaurant and found that it was a fast food restaurant. I asked casually, &quot;Are there any seafood noodles?&quot;, and the answer was, &quot;Yes, you can prepare seafood by yourself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, I happily served myself chilled shrimp, clams and dragonhead fish. The store owner asked me if I wanted razor clams. I told me that I didn’t want to eat razor clams because they would cause abdominal pain. The store owner took my selected seafood to the kitchen. I also remembered the club leader’s reminder to ask how much it would cost to eat seafood noodles. Last time she went there to eat, she was overcharged a lot without asking, so she specifically asked the price. The boss paused and said it was 48 yuan. I was a little surprised and thought to myself, this seafood noodle has never cost more than 30 yuan this year, but now it has increased by more than 50%? After thinking about it again, 48 yuan is not a big amount, so I acquiesced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After waiting for a while, the seafood noodles arrived. Because I was hungry, I picked up my chopsticks and ate it. I barely tasted it, but I found a lot of things wrong with it: Why was there razor clams in it? I chose three dragonhead fish that are more than ten centimeters long. Why are there only three small sections? Why is the shell of the shrimp so crispy and the meat of the shrimp so dry? It doesn’t look like it’s fresh, but it looks like it’s been dried in the sun? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My husband ate fast food. He ate before me and paid for it after he finished eating. After eating, I felt dissatisfied and argued with the boss, questioning whether the ingredients were out of the bag. This is great, three or four people in the store surrounded us, talking all over the place, and arrogantly denying my doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I asked: &quot;Who is in charge of your store?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Me,&quot; the boss said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Okay, everyone else shut up. We will negotiate with you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boss asked: &quot;What do you want to do?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I said: &quot; Refund my money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asked: &quot;Full refund?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I thought about it and said, &quot;That&#39;s not true. I also ate the noodles, so I will refund 20 yuan. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boss&#39;s eyes widened and he raised his voice: &quot;What? Impossible! Just go and complain!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I really didn&#39;t think of complaining before, but when he said this, I It also became popular and I directly dialed the 12345 hotline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About an hour later, I received a call, saying that it was from the Market Supervision Bureau. They had arrived at the scene and asked me if I had complained about the store adding extra razor clams to the seafood noodles. When I heard this, I was very surprised that the packaging of ingredients was so fresh and refined. I quickly said, I will review the matter for you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After repeating it briefly and concisely, the other party said that he would wait for him to verify it before making any decision. After a while, a call came, saying that no dried shrimps were found in the kitchen, and the razor clams were put in by mistake. I had no corresponding evidence, so I would not handle it. I said, I don’t accept this result. The boss had no fear from the beginning and asked me to “just complain.” Did he know that your arms would be bent inwards? I will continue to complain to the next higher level department. The previous complaints were: 1. The price deviated from the market and was suspected of robbing customers; 2. Ingredients were swapped; 3. The attitude was bad. If you insist on this attitude, then add another one: local protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;50 minutes later, I got a call. First, the boss was willing to apologize to me for his attitude and the wrong ingredients, and second, he was willing to refund 20 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should we be happy that things have come to this? No, no, no, I&#39;m not happy at all. Not only does it taste bad to eat a bowl of seafood noodles, but you actually have to call 12345, and the market supervisor will make you a mess. Although the matter was finally dealt with, I always felt that without my &quot;threat&quot;, the matter would have been settled. It would be frustrating if the resolution of the matter depends on such &quot;threats&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always trusted 12345 because of her awareness of serving the people, because of her efficient work efficiency, and because of her responsive and well-organized style of doing everything. In my complaint, the corresponding functional department personnel rushed to the scene in more than an hour, and the work efficiency was not high. But if we talk about the matter, I think there are still flaws in the handling of this matter. If I had a fair heart and was not partial to local businesses and not perfunctory to foreign tourists, then I wouldn’t feel so sorry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That evening, we came to an internet celebrity village on this island. We saw someone eating seafood noodles, so we asked the price and were told 30 yuan. The seafood noodles were made by an old couple who were over seventy years old. I asked them what kind of seafood was put in the seafood noodles. The old woman replied that there were live shrimps, razor clams, clams, and a poached egg. We happily ordered two bowls of seafood noodles, and my husband ate all the razor clams in them. It felt good to enjoy the sea breeze, listen to the waves, and watch the moon rise little by little. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While we were eating noodles, I saw this old couple selling more than a dozen bowls of noodles. I did a rough calculation and found that a bowl of noodles costs about 10 yuan, so their income for a day is quite considerable. A bowl of seafood noodles costs 30 yuan. The store makes a profit and tourists can accept it. What a harmonious ecology! I can’t understand why some businesses still want to rip off customers. Are they afraid of losing their own business? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a retired teacher)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt; /span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

My first friend in kindergarten was named Fu. I couldn&#39;t contact her for many years. I named her this name to commemorate her. &quot;Dolphin&quot; came from my dad jokingly saying one day that I looked like a dolphin tossing and turning on the bed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But I didn’t expect that netizens could associate “pig” with “dolphin”. I have been unable to lose weight because I have hypothyroidism and thyroid disease. Growing up, I was always called a &quot;fat pig&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I planned to shoot a video of riding the high-speed train in the early stage. I didn’t dare to go to a place that was too far away. My friend said that I would go to Qingyuan, which is less than half a mile from Guangzhou. Hours. I said try it and went straight over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After I squeezed into the high-speed train seat, I suddenly found that it was much higher than the next door. My butt was a little nervous, and my lower back was very tight because of the fat. The skirt I was wearing was a little puffy, and I didn&#39;t dare to close the armrests for fear that my body would overflow like water, which would be very embarrassing.

They may comment &quot;I like you&quot; or &quot;You are beautiful&quot;. There are also many plus-size sisters who say that they have also encountered this problem and have been called &quot;fat pigs&quot; since they were children. It feels like we are an ordinary group, but we are also a group that cannot speak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As soon as we go out, we will be discussed. We can&#39;t even maintain a peaceful mind. It just so happens that everyone is silent. Maybe everyone thinks they are an exception and no one will help us if we speak out.

I was spat on by an old man in a village in the city before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Once, I was waiting for the bus on the side of the road, and a couple next to me was discussing me. The woman said, &quot;If you were so fat, would you still love me?&quot; The man said, &quot;How could you be as fat as a pig? I will love you.&quot; They got on the bus with me and talked to me all the way on the bus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some time ago, I was suddenly grabbed by someone at the subway entrance. It was a girl about my age. She asked me how much I weighed, and I said 286 pounds. She said, &quot;You are still eating like this. No wonder you have gained so much weight. It is easy for you to die like this.&quot; Although I look big, I am always the one who cries when we quarrel with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people also say that if I were a boy, I might not be said like this. Because in popular belief, taller boys are more likely to be beaten violently when provoked, but girls may tolerate it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I cannot participate in many occasions&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sometimes, it is easy for others to do it It&#39;s hard for me to do things. I will think about whether I want to do it in advance to avoid encountering very embarrassing points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, when I enter the subway, I rarely sit. I usually stand in the corner, because when I sit down, I will occupy 1.5 seats. Sometimes as soon as I sit down, the person next to me will automatically bounce away. Another reason is that fat people do sweat easily and wear less in summer, which makes them embarrassed if they meet others. I have never stepped on other people&#39;s toes since I was a child, nor have I ever gone out of my way to squeeze past others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have never been to other cities, and I have never been on a plane until now. I&#39;ve always been so crowded when taking high-speed trains. The plane is even narrower and may not be able to accommodate me. I broke two swivel chairs while sitting on them at work. I also backed out of the elevator silently before because I was overweight. It was very embarrassing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are even more embarrassing things. I was renting a house once. I didn&#39;t want to damage the landlord&#39;s mattress, so I replaced it with my own thin mattress. As a result, when I sat down, a butt-sized hole appeared in the synthetic board underneath and it sank. The bed board had to be recycled. When the staff lifted the bed board down, I covered my face and tried to find a crack in the floor to crawl in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I don’t often go to dinner parties. I will check in advance whether the stools in this store can accommodate me. There are some plastic stools in food stalls. It is easy for us to fall when we sit on them, and even break other people&#39;s stools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I go out to stay in a hotel, I am always worried that the bed will collapse, so I will check the bed in advance. There is nothing that I can settle on casually. Although it is a bit exaggerated to say this, it is true. Every time I travel, I will read a lot of things in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is also one of the reasons why I am relatively introverted, because I cannot participate in many occasions. Sometimes when everyone goes out to play, I can’t play this or that. As friends, they don&#39;t want me to be alone. They might stay with me, but I don&#39;t want that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also gyms chasing me to sell cards, and I will be surrounded when I walk on the road. They all think of me like a big customer, the kind of long-term card holder. In fact, I do this, I have always had a fitness card, and I bought it from different places. Since 2016, I have been applying for an annual pass near the school and going there whenever I have time. I did it after work, and it turned out to be a very expensive course, costing more than 100 yuan per class. In the end, the gym ran away, and I still had more than 20 classes to attend, which was a huge loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am so familiar with their sales techniques that I can recite them by heart. Not long ago, a salesperson from a health care product store took me to play games in the store, and I had a lot of fun. happy. Then he came out with a product that said he would lose weight after drinking it. They thought I was easy to deceive, but he did make money from me. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Life is all about losing weight”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have a bad memory, and occasionally I feel sad when I think about some sad things. One day, they asked me what I had experienced in losing weight. I cried while thinking about it. I remembered many experiences and couldn’t stop crying. Being fat has indeed put a lot of psychological shadow on me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am from Cantonese and grew up in the south. People around me are as thin as poles. But when I was in the second grade of elementary school, I weighed 80 kilograms and looked round. In junior high school, I weighed 120 kilograms and was 1.68 meters tall. When I weighed more than 160 kilograms in high school, my classmates called me macho. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;My brother has been thinner than me since he was a child. When we go out, they all say that I steal all my brother’s food. In fact, I don’t. We both eat the same thing all the time. thing. When I was in school, my classmates would treat me as a strong man, carrying books, water and things, and I would be asked to throw a shot put at sports events. But in fact, fat people are not necessarily strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;My whole life is to lose weight. I have been trying to lose weight, but I have never succeeded. I am very depressed. As long as you eat a little bit of carbohydrates, your weight will quickly increase, and exercise will be useless. Looking at the food outside, you can’t buy this one, and that one is high in calories. For example, I don’t eat sugar-fried chestnuts, and I can’t touch the fried rice noodles, rice noodles, and rice rolls that are very common in Guangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was in college, in order to better integrate into the group, I went on a diet to lose weight, and I did lose more than 20 pounds. However, I had health problems, hair loss, and physiological problems. Period is also disordered. And when I&#39;m hungry, I get panicky and feel exhausted. I couldn&#39;t keep on losing weight for various reasons, and that kind of giving up has been in my life for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Last year, I signed up for a weight-loss training camp, where I trained for three months off-duty, and the tuition was 15,000 yuan. Among the 60 students, there are maybe six or seven who are similar in size to me, and we encourage each other. I get up at around 7 o&#39;clock in the morning and do aerobics, do strength barbell and dumbbell exercises in the afternoon, and ride spinning bikes in the evening. A group of people are like a disco. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Practice for four to five hours every day. There are only three spoons of rice in one meal, paired with a small grid of vegetarian dishes and a small grid of meat. But because I ate too little, I wasn’t able to exercise vigorously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the third month of training, everyone was coughing, but they still did aerobics while coughing. The whole private room was filled with the sound of coughing, which was very loud. So a plus-size girl doesn’t want to lose weight? Doesn&#39;t she want to work hard? We persisted for 3 months, but in the end I only lost 22 pounds. I asked the coach, I didn’t eat anything secretly, why couldn’t I lose weight? He said, &quot;Just don&#39;t eat it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later I went to the hospital for a check-up, and 11 tubes of blood were drawn, and insulin resistance and hypothyroidism were found. My function is poor and I lose weight slower than most people. Maybe a normal person loses one or two pounds a day when losing weight, but I only lose one or two pounds a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2022, Fu Doudan participated in a weight-loss training camp.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am indeed rejected in many environments and cannot be accommodated at home. Sixty percent of the reasons are because of my figure. My parents may tell others about how awesome their son is, but they never tell others about it because they feel ashamed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So I rarely go home and I don’t dare to go back. People say it every time. Many relatives would advise me to lose weight, and I could recite what they had to say. My mom would point to a plate and ask me, &quot;Do you know what this is? Your face is so round.&quot; You knew she was joking, but knives always cut through the heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I retreat to the point of no return, I will only jump into a bigger pit, and I will really jump. For a period of time, I was ostracized at work and had tense relationships at home. I couldn&#39;t lose weight, and I felt very frustrated. Our company is on the 18th floor. I stepped on the railing and wanted to jump off. It happened that a friend I met from work nearby sent me a message asking me if I wanted to go out for an ice cream. That message suddenly woke me up, and it seemed like someone cared about me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I think I may really have no way to survive. I ate alone, walked alone, hid in the house and didn’t want to see anyone, had a few breakdowns, was depressed, and spent a year in a very silent state. That year. My brother calls once a month and he only asks, are you okay? Still alive? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Until later, the relationship with my family eased a bit and I slowly came out of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Do something you are afraid of&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Change started from a field activity . I used to build a team with people from the company, and dozens of people went to ride mountain bikes and off-road vehicles. As soon as the game started, everyone ran 100 meters away, but my motorcycle kept stalling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I was also very anxious and didn’t want to fall behind. The coach next to me said impatiently, “It’s very dangerous for you to do this. Don’t drive. I’ll refund your money.” .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;My colleague couldn&#39;t stand it. He said to the coach, &quot;If they don&#39;t know it, you teach them. Why do you ask them to come down?&quot; I was very moved. , no one has supported me like this for a long time. After the coach taught me, I just started driving and my car crashed again. The coach said again, &quot;Don&#39;t drive. Come down and I will refund the ticket and the insurance to you.&quot; I said if you let me try again, just try again. That time I really drove up, even though I stalled the engine more than a dozen times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Did you know? When we reached a very high altitude, my car almost turned over. The slope is very steep, and the car has to rush up quickly. My weight may slow down the speed. But later I saw that it was not only me who couldn&#39;t pass that stretch of road, but also many other people, some of whom were too light, and the car really overturned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After reaching the top of the mountain, several coaches asked me to take a photo. I thought they were joking on me again, but I heard a coach say, &quot;This girl is great. She kept stalling at the beginning, and now she is driving here, and she is really great.&quot; He praised me, and I felt warm in my heart that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fu Doudou rides an off-road motorcycle.

Others may have ups and downs in their lives, but I have always been there. Volt. In short, this incident made me feel brave for the first time, and also made me reflect on the fact that some things cannot be stopped. If I gave up at the beginning, I would not have that sense of accomplishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another time, a friend from the gym caught me hiking and made an appointment to go to a relatively high scenic spot and climb hundreds of steps. At first, I didn&#39;t dare to go up. There was a sister who pulled me on every level. Every time I went up a dozen or so steps, I looked back, thinking about how I would get down later. In the end, I lay down on the steps and tried to go down. Move down step by step. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They helped me, but I said no. I was afraid that I would fall down with you, and my heart rate soared to 180 that day. But every time I do something I dare not do, I gain more courage. Later, I also challenged myself to ride roller coasters and merry-go-rounds, and attractions such as the Chain Bridge. I couldn&#39;t accept it before. I was always worried that it would break if I went on it, so I tried it later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am indeed afraid of all kinds of things. Maybe my life was all about losing weight before, but now I want to do some things that I&#39;m afraid of and enrich myself with other things. I also hope that the group of &quot;plus-size girls&quot; will stand up, be brave, and be seen by everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 18:25:11 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深秋青海：如诗如画]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259290]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家烟草专卖局原局长凌成兴落马，反腐震荡至烟草系统最高级别]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259432]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/JQJFMogZw7WnI1B7dpthiLXvmzRWXL7acvFQXdak.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/JQJFMogZw7WnI1B7dpthiLXvmzRWXL 7acvFQXdak. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255746&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ling Chengxing once proposed to &quot;prevent (tobacco control) from becoming expanded, one-sided, and absolute.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 23, 2023, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection reported that the former Party Secretary and Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration Ling Chengxing is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently undergoing disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that three days ago, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced that the Eighth Central Inspection Team will inspect the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration’s party group work mobilization meeting, which will “highlight the supervision of the ‘top leaders’ and leadership teams and conduct in-depth investigations. Corruption issues in key positions and key areas.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this year, many former officials of the State Tobacco Administration have been dismissed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Zehua, former member of the Party Leadership Group and deputy director, was investigated in July, and Zhang Hong, former director of the Department of Science and Technology, was investigated in July. Ling Chengxing is the highest-ranking official dismissed from the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration since its establishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Zhao Hongshun, a former party member and deputy director, was investigated in February 2019, and Pan Jiahua, a former party member and leader of the disciplinary inspection team, was investigated in January 2022. Zhao Hongshun was sentenced to life imprisonment in June 2020, and Pan Jiahua was sentenced to 11 years in prison in April 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The starting point of official career&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before Ling Chengxing was investigated, the tobacco system had been continuously shaken, and many department and bureau-level cadres were dismissed intensively across Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu and other places, among which Jiangxi, the starting point of Ling Chengxing&#39;s official career, was the hardest hit area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 1, 2023, Li Benjian, a former division-level cadre of the Jiangxi Tobacco Monopoly Bureau (Company), underwent disciplinary review and supervisory investigation. According to Caixin reports, this person once served as Ling Chengxing’s driver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 6, Zheng Wei, Party Secretary, Director and General Manager of the Guangdong Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau (Company), was dismissed. He was previously the General Manager of China Tobacco Jiangxi. On the same day, Fu Wujun, the first-level business manager of the Human Resources Department of China Tobacco Jiangxi, was subject to disciplinary review and supervisory investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanggao County in Jiangxi Province was the starting point of Ling Chengxing’s career. He started working in 1980 and was promoted to the Standing Committee and Deputy County Magistrate of Shanggao County at the age of 27. Thereafter, he served as director of the Jiangxi Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, and eventually became a member of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and executive deputy governor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Ling Chengxing was elected as a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress in Jiangxi. A media person who interviewed Ling Chengxing at the Two Sessions told Southern Weekend reporters that during the discussion, everyone still called Ling Chengxing &quot; Governor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retiring in 2018, Ling Chengxing was still very concerned about his hometown Shanggao. His only public appearance after retirement was to visit the water supply company in his hometown accompanied by the local county party secretary, county People’s Congress director and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Area hardest hit by corruption&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From 2013 to 2018, Ling Chengxing served as a member of the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group, and Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure, China&#39;s cigarette sales fell by 2.4% in 2015, the first decline since 1995, equivalent to smokers reducing their consumption of 60 billion cigarettes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that the tobacco tax will be raised by 6 percentage points starting from May 10, 2015. The price and tax rate of the cigarette wholesale link will be increased from 5% to 11%, and the price will be increased by 0.005 yuan/cigarette. A specific tax is levied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the trend of declining sales, Ling Chengxing, who has always been low-key, took the initiative to accept an interview with the &quot;Study Times&quot; sponsored by the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, proposing to &quot;prevent (tobacco control) from becoming expanded, one-sided, and absolute.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the National Two Sessions in 2015, this also became the focus of reporters’ questions. What is the expansion of tobacco control? Ling Chengxing replied: &quot;Let me give you an example. Some people say that bone hyperplasia is caused by smoking. I think this has no scientific basis. What do you think?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, China&#39;s cigarette sales stopped falling and rebounded. rose, with 47.378 million boxes sold throughout the year, an increase of 0.8% compared with 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the discussion of tobacco control, the tobacco industry’s government-enterprise integration system has always been the focus of discussion. In the eyes of the tobacco control party, the government-enterprise integration system has become the biggest obstacle to tobacco control in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ling Chengxing’s predecessor, former Party Secretary and Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, Jiang Chengkang, made the biggest institutional reform of China’s tobacco industry by promoting the “separation of industry and commerce” at the provincial level, but the reform failed to continue. further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Ling Chengxing took office, he followed the previous ideas and rapidly expanded the scale of the company through mergers and alliances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first stop for his research after taking office was in Yunnan. After the merger of Hongyun Group and Honghe Group, the newly established &quot;Hongyun Honghe Group&quot; became the largest group after Altria Group, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco. , the world&#39;s fifth largest tobacco group after Imperial Tobacco. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 30, 2013, a symposium on cultivating major brands of Yunzhen cigarettes was held in Mile County, Honghe Prefecture. Ling Chengxing, who had just taken over as the director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, issued the tobacco &quot;Policy Agenda&quot; for the first time: Adhere to &quot; &quot;Three Stabilities&quot; (the guiding ideology determined at the beginning of the year remains unchanged, the goals and tasks remain unchanged, and the work measures remain unchanged); maintain the &quot;Three Stabilities&quot; (stabilize the leadership team, stabilize the cadre team, and stabilize the morale of the employees); think, plan, and practice &quot;Three major issues&quot; (where are the dividends of tobacco industry reform, where is the potential for development, and where is the goal of catching up). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ling Chengxing also implemented a number of reforms during his tenure. Starting in 2014, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration issued the &quot;Key Points of the Market-oriented Reform of Cigarette Marketing&quot; for four consecutive years, but it was limited to the marketing level, focusing on &quot; How can commercial enterprises truly reflect market demand, how can industrial enterprises meet demand in a timely manner, and how can industrial and commercial enterprises respond to market demand in a timely manner?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike the previous &quot;foreign troubles&quot; in which China Tobacco faced direct competition with foreign brands, Ling Chengxing faced more internal management pressure. During his tenure, many major cases occurred in the tobacco system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, a scandal broke out in the Henan Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, and many people including the former director were arrested. There is also the case of Yang Weizu, chairman of Yunnan Ruisheng Group, who is associated with the Yunnan Tobacco Science Research Institute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, at least a dozen central officials in the tobacco system have been eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Ping, Party Secretary and General Manager of Hunan China Tobacco Industry Co., Ltd., was investigated in October 2020 and was suspected of accepting bribes of 413 million yuan and misappropriating public funds of 135 million yuan. This case is known as the most serious job-related crime in the tobacco system since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A disciplinary inspection cadre analyzed the causes of corruption in the tobacco system to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The tobacco system is different from other vertically managed departments. It is a system that integrates government and enterprises, and the path to realize power is very difficult. Short, all links are accompanied by indicators, which results in power being permanently concentrated in the hands of a few people and the lack of effective supervision, making it more difficult to fight corruption in the tobacco system.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tobacco Bureau even controls the money bags of local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An interesting detail is that during the National People’s Congress in 2015, a mayor publicly appealed to Ling Chengxing that he wanted to improve the quality of cigarette production. “It used to be that Septwolves were basically OEM, and the taxes and profits of Septwolves were relatively low. It would be great if the next step is to produce Chinese cigarettes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was refuted by Ling Chengxing on the spot, &quot;That&#39;s impossible. China Tobacco is a banner of the tobacco industry.&quot; The mayor said with a smile that “it may not all be the pen of the (old) governor” and suggested that better equipment could be invested in production. Ling Chengxing still insisted, &quot;When you come to engage in Zhonghua Cigarettes, you will immediately destroy the Zhonghua Cigarettes (brand).&quot; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the mayor continued, &quot;While the (old) provincial governor is in the position of the General Administration, a certain city&#39;s tobacco industry chain tax revenue can reach 10 billion yuan.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that this media record at the time was preserved under Ling Chengxing&#39;s instruction. According to an insider, &quot;He may have just wanted to show that he rejected the other party.&quot; The mayor who made this request was dismissed soon after because of his involvement in the Su Rong case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“啥都不用干”是最大的福气吗？ ]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259230]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Many people have said &quot;I don&#39;t want to work&quot; when they are sleepy or frustrated, but these words are probably inappropriate. Really, if we don’t have any mines or pie from the sky, what else can we do if we don’t move bricks honestly? But there are indeed some people who regard &quot;no work and someone to support you&quot; as the highest ideal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A blogger said that since childhood, her aunt has indoctrinated a bunch of little girls, including her, with the idea that girls are &quot;blessed&quot; and can enjoy a good life without doing anything. . Not only do you not have to do anything, but you marry a good family and you don&#39;t even need to take care of the children yourself. That is what you are blessed to do. This concept is close to &quot;labor equals shame&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all have inertia and a desire for comfort. In our subconscious, we may have had the image of just lying down and enjoying ourselves. When I was a kid, I experienced the intense itching pain all over my body after harvesting and threshing rice and wheat by hand. I also had &quot;plans&quot; to stop working. But honestly, just think about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The extravagant and luxurious life in books and movies is described in the wonderful lyrics of &quot;Huang Liang Meng&quot; by the Pingdiao Luozi Theater Company in Handan City, Hebei Province: &quot;Endless generosity, endless power; Endless delicacies to eat, endless money to spend; endless carols to listen to, endless gifts to receive; endless wealth to enjoy, endless New Years to live.&quot; Ordinary people can just think about it, and really educate themselves like this Children, that&#39;s really gone astray. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For ordinary people, when they are minors, they are supported by their parents, and when they become adults, they have to support themselves and their families on their own. If you want to live a good life, you can only accumulate it step by step. This is the first meaning of work for most people: to support their families. In order to achieve this goal, many people work very hard and may not be in a career they like, but they persist because this job can bring acceptable returns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is very painful to do a job that you don&#39;t like for a long time. A friend told me that the joyless days at work day after day were really a torture. But even so, we can&#39;t &quot;just leave&quot;, we can only wait for the opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My friend’s words moved me deeply. The reason why people should work hard is because work should have a second meaning: combining it with one&#39;s own talents and interests, making the work itself a source of fulfillment and happiness. Many writers have been doing writing work for a lifetime based on their talent and interest. I have also been a media commentator for many years based on my talent and interest. This is a blessing. There is also a kind of work that may seem heavy and tiring, but it may be something that workers like to do. For example, blacksmithing is not acceptable to most people, but in reality there are people who work very hard at it. I also heard a car mechanic say that although it may be tiring and dirty all day long, it is a job that interests him and cannot let him go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the values ​​that ordinary people should uphold, try to do meaningful work and live a meaningful life. In other words, a livelihood should be one that can not only meet the purpose of earning money to support the family, but also satisfy interests and hobbies. Accordingly, we not only get practical benefits, such as income and evaluation, but also spiritual satisfaction. This sense of gain is the spiritual source that enriches us in this world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people envy the financial freedom of wealthy families, but they only know one aspect but not the other. Even among the envied few &quot;giant pandas&quot; in society, most of them do not relax their requirements for their children. Instead, they pay more attention to providing high-quality education and scientific employment guidance to their children, and to promote their children to pursue a decent and respectable career. jobs and better realize the value of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually, these families need their children to inherit the family business. In order not to be left behind for this goal, they are motivated to help their children avoid becoming &quot;waste&quot; and &quot;dandy children&quot; who only consume high amounts of money and live in vain. Look at the young people who have inherited the family business of wealthy parents today. Which one has not experienced the nourishment of a good education and the tempering of basic work. Many people have the ability to protect their children from dust, but they still let them start from the &quot;workshop&quot; and perceive the meaning of life. This is true wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the many second-generation rich people do not sit around doing nothing all day long, eating, drinking, and waiting to die as some people imagine. In other words, people who are more &quot;qualified&quot; than ordinary people to do nothing work harder than you. What other reason do you have for fantasizing about “doing nothing”? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don’t forget, if you really have nothing to do, you will definitely fall into emptiness. If a person does not &quot;fill&quot; his life with meaningful things, he will easily fall into emptiness and become as light as a feather. In this case, even if you get a fortune one day, you will not be able to control such wealth. In Yu Hua&#39;s novel &quot;To Live&quot;, he explained the story of a swinger brother who lost his family fortune by gambling. How many such folk narratives are there? After the demolition in my hometown many years ago, the &quot;second generation&quot; became rich instantly. However, it is not uncommon for them to lose their property overnight due to gambling, dissoluteness, and being cheated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am obviously middle class or even poor, but I still always want to live a &quot;fairy life&quot; like a powerful or wealthy family, just enjoying myself and not working. To put it mildly, this is unrealistic, but to put it seriously, it is unrealistic. This is a lack of self-awareness. This idea is difficult to realize. In short, humans are animals of meaning, and meaning is the food of the spiritual world. On the basis of establishing a good life, people should do meaningful work or career to nourish our spirit. Under the sun and on the earth, we should still let ourselves &quot;sink&quot;, settle down, and become human plants that are truly not afraid of wind and rain. This principle applies to both the second generation of rich people and the children of ordinary people. Meaningful work or a meaningful career is the &quot;key&quot; that helps a person lead to a happy and transparent state. Only when you find a sense of presence and cultivate your character in your work or career, can you follow the trend. For, gradually improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
