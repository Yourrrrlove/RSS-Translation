The current Cultural Relics Protection Law was promulgated in November 1982. It has been revised five times and was comprehensively revised in 2002. Cultural relics work in the new era is facing new situations and new tasks. Some new situations and new problems have emerged in the field of cultural relics protection. In order to adapt to the needs of the development of cultural relics undertakings, revisions are urgently needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, the revised draft of the Cultural Relics Protection Law was submitted to the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People’s Congress for its first review. The revised draft implements the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and reflects the new requirements for cultural relics work in the new era; insists on putting protection first and further improves the cultural relics protection and management system; properly handles the relationship between protection and utilization and promotes the rational use of cultural relics; takes multiple measures simultaneously to increase Increase penalties and severely crack down on illegal acts that destroy cultural relics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 23:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[长安最饶丨本草物色]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258773]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/17/sTw5HeYzjhS9pdXvXJOMaY4B285th4QWtAU8QY0Q.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/sTw5HeYzjhS9pdXvXJOMaY4B28 5th4QWtAU8QY0Q. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254312&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tribulus. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Historical Records&quot;, among the aristocratic families that record the rise and fall of various vassal states, Wei State is known for its civil strife. The bottom line of the king&#39;s lack of morality is also eye-catching. This important vassal state in the early Zhou Dynasty that collected the remnants of the Yin Dynasty and lived in the ancient Shang Ruins in Heqijian, despite the warnings of Zhou Gong&#39;s three imperial edicts and the beginning of Kang Shu&#39;s good governance, for most of the subsequent time, fathers and sons killed each other and brothers died. The paragraph goes on and on, and Confucius&#39;s sentence &quot;You must also correct your name&quot; comes from it. Among them, the one most criticized by historians is the so-called Xuanjiang Rebellion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xuan Jiang is a famous beauty. She is the daughter of Duke Xi of Qi and the wife of Duke Xuang of Wei. The overlord Duke Huan of Qi is her brother, and the famous Lady Xu Mu is her daughter. She is regarded as a specimen of beauty&#39;s misfortunes. It is said that the five generations have been restless, and chaos started from Jiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duke Xuan of Wei had an affair with his concubine Yi Jiang and gave birth to his son Ji. Make him a prince and marry Qi&#39;s daughter for him. Before they got married, Duke Xuan heard that Qi&#39;s daughter was stunningly beautiful. He fell in love with her in a second and was so flirtatious that he immediately cut off her husband and took over the house without any worries, so that he could marry someone else for the prince. Qi Nu gave birth to sons Shou and Shuo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Yijiang committed suicide because he fell out of favor. The daughter of Qi, also known as Xuan Jiang, who became the first wife, and her son Shuo slandered Duke Xuan and framed the prince. Duke Xuan was dissatisfied, so he ordered the prince to go to Qi as an envoy and sent people to intercept and kill the prince on the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shou told the prince the truth and persuaded him to escape, but the prince refused because he could not violate his father&#39;s orders. So Shou took the crown prince&#39;s banner and went to be killed on his brother&#39;s behalf. The prince arrived shortly after and announced that he should kill me, but he was also killed. So Gongshuo was declared the crown prince. After the death of Duke Xuan, Shuo ascended the throne as Duke Hui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Hui Gong&#39;s family slandered the prince and replaced him, the Wei people were resentful, so they rebelled and made his younger brother Qian Mou the king. Hui Gong fled. Later, Duke Xiang of Qi led the princes to attack the guards on the king&#39;s order, Qian Mou fled, and Duke Hui was restored to power. Duke Xiang of Qi asked Xuan Jiang to remarry Ji&#39;s other brother Wan, and they gave birth to three sons and two daughters. However, the root of the slander has not been eliminated, and civil strife in Weiguo still occurs one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Placing blame for civil strife on women is a common tactic in traditional narratives. In fact, Jiang, who was in the vortex of scratching and superimposing, was also killed, which is enough to create another meaning of anxiety about appearance. Admittedly, the victim himself was not perfect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Book of Songs, which is called Si Wuxie, has many reflections on this incident, such as &quot;Xintai&quot;, &quot;Two Sons in a Boat&quot; and &quot;Wang Youci&quot;. &quot;The wall has thorns&quot; says:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wall has thorns and cannot be blocked. What you say in the middle is unreasonable. What can be said is ugly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wall has thorns and cannot support it. What Zhong Wei said cannot be specified. What can be described in detail is long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wall has thorns and cannot be restrained. The words in the middle are unreadable. It can be read, but it is insulting to say it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confucian scholar Zhu Xi said: Ci is also called tribulus. Sprawling, thin leaves, triangular seeds, stinging. Pharmacist Tao Hongjing described that it grows on roads and walls, with leaves spread all over the ground and seeds with thorns, shaped like rhombus but small. Chang&#39;an is the most affluent place, and many people walk with wooden shoes. Nowadays, the military is made of cast iron to cover the enemy&#39;s roads, and it is called iron caltrop. &quot;Book of Changes&quot; says &quot;according to tribulus&quot;, which means it can cause severe damage. &quot;Poetry&quot; says that &quot;the wall has thorns and cannot be blocked&quot;, which is used to stave off filth. The prescription is very rare. Li Shizhen explained from the perspective of sound training: Tribulus means disease; Quinoa means benefit; Ci means thorn. It hurts people very quickly and is very beneficial. Materia Medica also has names such as Qu Ren and Zhi Xing, which are all derived from its ability to hurt people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most common man in Chang&#39;an said that he had no choice but to wear wooden shoes for protection due to the proliferation of herbs. The caltrops made of cast iron bear witness to the early development of bionic weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shizhen’s analysis of Tribulus terrestris varieties: Tribulus terrestris leaves are like young honey locust leaves, neat and cute. Tribulus terrestris is shaped like red-rooted rapeseed and fine water chestnuts, with a triangle and four spines, and is actually a benevolent plant. The white Tribulus terrestris has pods that are about an inch long, with inner seeds as big as sesame seeds, shaped like sheep kidneys and tinged with green. People today call it Tribulus terrestris. Distinguish this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is mainly treated under the column, where the herbal medicine breaks the crux and accumulates, sore throat and breast difficulty. Taking it for a long time will build muscles, improve eyesight and lighten the body. It can be used to treat various wind ulcers, vomiting and pus, and remove dryness and heat. It induces abortion, and the woman&#39;s milk is released. Treats wind secretion and roundworm abdominal pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the prescription is rarely used, there are quite a few conveniences in the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to take: One stone of Tribulus terrestris seeds, collected when ripe in July and August, dried every day , pound it to remove the thorns, and pestle it to remove the thorns. Take two qian for each dose, mix it with fresh water, and take it three times a day. Do not let it die, and it will cut off the grain and lead to longevity. After taking it for one year, it will not be cold in winter or hot in summer. In two years, the old man has become younger again, his hair has turned white and black again, and his teeth have fallen out again. If you take it for three years, you will be light and live forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Induced labor: difficult labor, the fetus is in the abdomen, cannot be coated and the fetus dies. Take four liang each of Tribulus terrestris and Fritillaria as powder, and take three qian in rice soup. Do not take it for a while, then take it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ascaris heartache: vomiting water. On July 7th, pluck Tribulus terrestris seeds, dry them in the shade, and burn them into ashes. Eat them first and take Fang Cun Dagger three times a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirty years of blindness: Liver-tonifying powder: Harvest Tribulus terrestris on July 7th, dry in the shade and pound into powder. Take Fang Cun Dagger with water after meals, for two days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tooth shakes: pain and shock. Grind 5 qian of raw Tribulus terrestris into half a bowl of dilute water, dip it in water and add salt to warm it and rinse it, it is very effective. Or use the roots to burn the ashes, and the teeth will be firmly attached. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nasal congestion and watery discharge: I have not smelled any fragrance for many years. Take two handfuls of tribulus and boil half a cup of it with a large cup of water when a cart runs over it. Lie on your back, put rice in your mouth first, and pour the juice into your nose. If it is blocked and re-administered, one or two polyps appear like red chrysalis, which will heal immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scars on the face: combine Tribulus terrestris and Shantouzi into powder, mix with vinegar, and apply it at night to wash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vitiligo: 6 liang of Tribulus terrestris seeds, raw and pounded into powder, take 2 qian for each soup, twice a day. After one month, the roots will disappear, and after taking it for half a month, red spots will appear on the white areas, which is a miracle effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are not only the secrets of the gods that the winter will not be cold but the summer will not be hot, the old man will be reborn and his teeth will fall, the valley will be broken and the valley will be immortal, as well as the desperate and chronic disease of thirty years of blindness, as well as the emergency that prompts the birth of lower clothes, and more Shaking teeth, stuffy nose, and vitiligo are common and difficult diseases that are common in daily life. However, the prognosis of more effective or even miraculous effects, as well as the description of the situation described in the prescription, cannot be ruled out. Yun Er can present a mirrored ironing post. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[爱上长者饭堂的年轻人，图什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258867]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;Visit:&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Clean and hygienic prices are not expensive&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Elderly The canteen is popular among some young people&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The braised pork with pickled cabbage, stir-fried pork with cauliflower, green vegetables, corn and carrot soup...

It uses boiling, stewing, steaming and other methods to make the ingredients soft and easy to digest, and focuses on less salt, less oil and lower fat.

This provides a loophole for the proliferation of AI-generated books. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Who is writing my biography?&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Dang Luo Li When Ciaran Jones discovered a biography of himself on Amazon, he had a strange question. He flipped through part of the book and it showed that he lived in an academic family, his father was an affable scholar and his mother was a teacher. The book is almost comparable to his own memoirs, except that the information in it is &quot;total fantasy&quot;, he told the Guardian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Rory&#39;s father is a BBC television director, and his mother also works at the BBC. One day, he discovers the emotional stories of his parents in a shoebox containing letters, and thus uncovers the truth about his family&#39;s history. These stories are recorded in his real memoirs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the biography about him, Rory had never heard of the biographer, but he soon discovered that the book was generated by AI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lori’s experience is not an isolated one. According to multiple foreign media reports, AI-generated books are flooding Amazon. These books range from biographies, cookbooks, popular science books to travel guides, etc. Some of the misinformation in some of these books can even be life-threatening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The New York Mycological Society (NYMS) publicly stated that many AI-generated mushroom foraging popular science books on Amazon and other e-commerce platforms contain many erroneous descriptions, which may mislead the public into eating poisonous mushrooms, &quot;meaning of life and death.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“A&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;has crushed Amazon”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In June, writer Caitlin Lynch posted on social platforms, pointing out that among the top 100 best-selling Amazon teen contemporary romance e-books, only 19 are normal books, and the rest are AI-generated &quot;nonsense.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also attached a screenshot of a book called &quot;Waiting for You to Love Me&quot;, with a black and white photo of a seagull on the cover. Previously, the book was ranked No. 90 on Amazon&#39;s top 100 bestsellers list in the Teen Contemporary Romance category. The two one-star reviews below also pointed out that it is a book generated by AI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;AI has defeated Amazon.&quot; Lynch wrote in a tweet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report by the New York Times in August, travel guides have also become one of the main categories where AI books are flooding. In March, traveler Amy Korsky purchased a travel guide on Amazon for her upcoming trip to France. When she entered a few search keywords &quot;travel&quot;, &quot;guidebook&quot; and &quot;France&quot;, a top-ranked &quot;France Travel Guide&quot; caught her attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the author page, the author of the book, Mike Steves, is a &quot;famous travel writer.&quot; There are more than a hundred five-star reviews on the book&#39;s interface, and the guide also promises itineraries and recommendations from locals. So Amy Kolsky placed the order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To her disappointment, when she received the book, she found that the descriptions inside were vague, the text was repetitive, and the itinerary lacked an itinerary that looked like it had been copied and pasted from Wikipedia. She returned the book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The New York Times discovered that things are not simple. They were unable to find any previously published works by the so-called &quot;author&quot; of the book. Even the photo of the &quot;author&quot; on the interface looked strange, such as abnormal elements near the ears, crooked clothes, etc., which seemed to be photos generated by AI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the results of the AI ​​detection tool Originality.ai, Mike Steves&#39; book was almost certainly AI-generated. In addition, the New York Times found that AI-generated books have also begun to penetrate cooking, programming, medicine, gardening and many other categories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In many media reports, AI-generated books not only bring misleading information to readers, but also cause great trouble to real authors. In August, writer Jane Friedman stated on her blog that some “junk books” had been uploaded to Amazon. Her name was listed in the author column, but she did not write these books. They were extremely misleading. Most likely generated by AI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has been blogging since 2009. Many of the contents are public and can be used for AI model training. So when she reads the first page of these &quot;fake books,&quot; it&#39;s like she&#39;s reading a self-generated ChatGPT reply. To make matters worse for her, these &quot;fake books&quot; were added to her Goodreads profile, which could easily be misleading. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After she complained about this on social platforms, some authors responded that they had had similar experiences. &quot;People keep telling me they bought my new book and it has my name on it but I never wrote it,&quot; one author said. Some authors reported 29 books with similar situations in just one week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The scary thing is that this can happen to anyone with a reputation, a status, a need, and someone sees a way to profit from it.&quot; In an interview with CNN , said Jane Friedman. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Effectively allowing &#39;junk books&#39; to exist&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Amazon after Rory discovered that his biography was AI-generated Sent him an email with a recommendation that said, &quot;You might like this book.&quot; This made Rory angry that Amazon&#39;s algorithm thought this was a book he wanted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;They are essentially allowing &#39;junk books&#39; to exist and recommending them to the people who hate them the most,&quot; Rory told the Guardian. Although Amazon later removed the book, many titles passed through a filtering system designed to weed out low-quality books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the appearance of many AI-generated books on the Amazon platform has a lot to do with the abuse of its own self-publishing system KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing). In 2007, Amazon created KDP to allow anyone to self-publish and sell books on Amazon. Currently, it offers more than 45 language options. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the Amazon KDP platform, authors can freely choose to self-publish e-books or paper books. After completing the upload process of self-published books, Amazon can pass the review and sell them in about 72 hours. Self-publishing a book on this platform is free, however, if publishing a physical book, the printing costs are deducted from the royalties earned from each book sale. Generally speaking, authors can receive royalties of up to 60% for paper books and 35% or 70% for e-books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, many tutorials using AI to generate books have appeared on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok. Their topics range from a wide range of topics, and many users can quickly master AI generation from them. book method, coupled with the convenience and benefits of Amazon’s self-publishing function, it is difficult to avoid the abuse of this function for AI book publishing and sales. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September, Amazon introduced new rules and guidelines on its KDP community page after receiving complaints from many authors. The new regulations require authors to answer the system’s questions about whether the work is generated by artificial intelligence when publishing their work. In its content guide section, Amazon has also added content about AI, including definitions of “AI-generated” and “AI-assisted.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Guardian&quot; report, due to concerns about artificial intelligence, Amazon introduced new rules that limit self-publishers to publish a maximum of three books per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even though the new regulations have been released, some impacts have already been caused. In the wake of the Jane Friedman scandal, books bearing her name were removed from Amazon and her Goodreads profile. But the process wasn&#39;t smooth, and Amazon initially refused to stop selling the books. Jane Friedman believes it was ultimately her popularity and reputation in the writing and publishing world that prompted Amazon to pull the books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With the deluge of AI-powered content now posted on Amazon, sometimes with misleading or fraudulent attribution to authors, how can working authors be expected to spend time every week for the rest of their lives policing this? What&#39;s the content?&quot; she asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And even if those books no longer appear on her Amazon or Goodreads pages, their impact remains. Jane Friedman wrote on her blog: &quot;Unfortunately, even if you remove these crazy books from your official profile, they will still be with your name...and you have no idea about it. But there is nothing we can do.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[毕业生求职，“我全都要”容易实现吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258810]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Affected by the economic environment and the number of graduates, the employment situation of college students graduating this year is severe. Although my friend Xiaoyan, a recent graduate student, received several offers (job opportunities), he was not happy at all, but became even more anxious. After some inquiries, he found out that none of these jobs seemed to meet the standards of his ideal job. How to choose a suitable job is a question that every graduate needs to think about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of economics, there is a famous &quot;Mundell&#39;s Impossible Triangle&quot;. This theory is that the country cannot simultaneously satisfy the independence of monetary policy, the stability of exchange rates, and the free flow of capital, and can only choose two of them at most. Similarly, in the job market, I think there is a similar &quot;impossible triangle&quot; law. It involves three conditions: salary level, work platform and relative stability of a job. It is difficult to achieve at the same time, and only two of them can be met at most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let me briefly introduce the basic information of this friend: Xiaoyan comes from a rural family in a provincial capital in the northwest. He graduated from a 211 university with a bachelor&#39;s degree and a doctorate from a well-known 985 university in Beijing, with excellent grades; he published many publications during his studies. He has written SCI papers, participated in many national-level projects, and won many high-level competition awards. The three offers he got each have clear characteristics. His first job was as an official in the national ministries and commissions. He had a household registration, a good job platform, and a relatively high social status. However, his income level was in a first-tier city like Beijing, and there might not be much left after excluding expenses. Faced with the high housing prices, he was more than satisfied. The second job belongs to a monopoly institution in the industry, with a staff and a guaranteed income, but the platform is average, and there are more restrictions on job-hopping in the future; the third job is in a 211 university in my hometown, with a high level of scientific research platform and strong academic strength. The job is rich and the working hours are relatively free. The only drawback is that with the reform of universities and institutions, this job has no establishment and the employment period assessment pressure is high. He is worried that in the future he will face the outcome of promotion or resignation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Xiaoyan’s final choice has not yet been determined, I suggest that when he is looking for a job, his first priority is to learn to lower his expectations for a specific factor, rather than falling into a &quot;I want it all&quot; situation. As far as these three jobs are concerned, if he prefers a stable working environment within the system, he should probably lower his salary expectations. The first job may be the best choice; if he pursues better salary and treatment, he needs Compromise on the requirements of the work platform, so that the second job may be more suitable; if you yearn for a better scientific research platform and are interested in academic development, Xiaoyan can try to be less optimistic about the establishment of this indicator and challenge the third university teaching position. The job is not bad either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the moon waxes and wanes, and work also has its flaws. For most graduating college students, the jobs they find basically conform to the &quot;impossible triangle&quot; law. Therefore, when necessary, we need to identify the needs and learn to make trade-offs, so that we can feel less anxious and face the severe employment environment calmly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a doctoral graduate in 2023)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Along the railway line are apple orchards in the harvest season. In some areas, branches and leaves covered with red fruits are brushing against your hands, separated by the glass windows of the train. That kind of surprise is really quite strong. To really touch an apple, you have to go to the station supermarket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aomori’s apple production accounts for half of Japan’s national production. It is the birthplace of the world-famous Fuji apple, as well as twenty or thirty other varieties of apples. The &quot;world&#39;s best&quot; apples grown in Aomori weigh more than 500 grams each, and some can reach 1,000 or even 1,500 grams. When we were shopping in the supermarket, we saw that those Aomori apples were also huge. They were sold one by one for about 500 yen each, which is equivalent to about 30 yuan in RMB. It&#39;s a little more expensive, but it&#39;s juicy and tastes sweet. The three of us bought a shared meal while changing trains at a small station, and we were all full. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While in Aomori, of course I had a destination - go to Kaneki to see Dazai Osamu&#39;s former residence &quot;Seiyangkan&quot;, and also went to Towada to visit the famous Towada Museum of Art. As for Basho&#39;s whereabouts, it has to reach a climax after this cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We turned around from north to south, took the bus from Aomori to Sendai, and then transferred to the main route to Matsushima Kaigan Station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bajiao chants: &quot;On a summer moonlit night in Songdao, the clear water is my clothes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Basho and Zeng Liang’s trip to Oshu, he said, was purely a whim, so he didn’t care about Wu Tianbai’s hatred. This whim was mentioned in his preface, because the Moon of Songdao appeared in his heart, tempting him to go on the road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Tian&#39;s white hair is a reference to Bai Juyi&#39;s &quot;I arrived in Dongluo on the 9th last year, and I came to Wuxiang on the 9th this year.

The ancient Japanese traditional color name is pine leaf color. As the name suggests, the color of pine leaves is a dark green that is evergreen all year round. Among the traditional Japanese colors, there are several colors related to pine leaves, including sea pine color, which is a green that is close to black; and sea pine brown, which is a dark green mixed with brown and yellow, which is a calm and pretty green. Then there are sea pine blue, yellow sea pine tea, blue sea pine tea, etc., which in my opinion are various derivatives of pine leaf color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Oku no Homichi&quot;, Basho would occasionally note that he had reached a certain &quot;singing pillow&quot;. The word &quot;Utabu&quot; means a place of interest that has appeared in Japanese Waka since ancient times. At the top of Japan&#39;s singing pillow, there are three scenic spots: Amanohashidate, Matsushima and Itsukushima (also called Miyajima). These three major attractions have been famous since the early Edo period. For me, Matsushima feels more literary because of Basho&#39;s description in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;. Basho&#39;s &quot;aphasia&quot; was particularly interesting. He shouted, &quot;Matsushima! Ah! Ah! Matsushima!

It is composed of 260 small islands, large and small. They are named because they are covered with black pine and red pine. The four colors here are blue waves, white sand, limestone, and green pine. The colors are quite bright and harmonious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, 2019, Wei Dong, Yan Ning and I set off from Hachinohe in Aomori to Matsushima. Take the bus from Hachinohe Station to Sendai, then transfer to the main line to Matsushima Kaigan Station. A very small station platform stands in the middle of the railway. When we arrive at night, the biting cold wind blows from all sides of the platform. After all, it is already autumn. The sun is warm during the day, but disappears at night. We quickly got on the shuttle bus between the hotel and the station, turned a hill, and arrived at the hotel &quot;Daguanzhuang&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large rectangular building lying on its back, with a huge lobby extending to both ends of the building. This large-scale resort hotel is almost identical and can be found in Hakone and Hokkaido. I highly doubt it was done by a designer. When you see a hotel of this size, you know how popular Songdo is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you enter Songdo at night, you can’t see much. When you wake up in the morning and open the curtains, you will be greeted by a 180-degree sea view. Beautiful indeed. Her pure and simple beauty is suitable for people like Basho who are in a light and lonely state of mind. Basho also lives in Songdao facing the sea, on the second floor (we live higher than him on the third floor). He said, “Opening the window and facing the sea, the so-called traveling and sleeping in the wind and clouds, the wonderful feeling is indescribable. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I carry &quot;The Secret Path of the Oku&quot; with me. When I arrived at Songdao, I read the chapter about &quot;Songdao&quot; in the book carefully. Basho sighed, &quot;According to old legend, Fusang ranks first in the scenery of Songdao, and its coverage is not inferior to that of Dongting and West Lake. From the southeast, the sea enters the bay, and within three miles of the bay, it surges like the tide of Zhejiang. There are countless big and small islands, and the towering ones point directly to the sea. Outside the sky, prostrate ones are crawling on the waves. Either two layers overlap, or three layers are piled up; the islands on the left and right are either separated or connected; those with burdens and those with hugs are like loving children and grandchildren. The pines are lush, the tide is blowing, the wind is blowing, the branches and leaves The curves are natural, but appear to be the result of manipulation. The scenery is natural, with the appearance of a beautiful woman condensing her makeup. Could it be that the mountains were only made by the gods in ancient times? Who can use the colorful brushes of the heavens to achieve their beauty? Really?&quot; (Translated by Zheng Qingmao)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bajiao has never been to China, but he is not reluctant to borrow the scenery of China. Through reading Chinese classics and paintings, ancient Japanese literati became quite familiar with and intimate with Chinese scenic spots such as the West Lake, Dongting Lake, and Qianjiang Tide. A matter of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the winter of 2018, my friends and I visited the Sumio Goto Museum of Art in Furano. I vaguely remember that he seemed to have a painting of Songdao, and it was a very long painting. I remember that I took a photo (Special note, many art museums in Japan are not allowed to take photos of exhibits, or can only take photos of some of the exhibits. I strictly abide by this rule. Photography is allowed for all exhibits in the Goto Juno Museum of Art) ). In November 2019, after returning home from a trip to Oshu, I turned on my computer to check, and I found this painting. I was very surprised. Isn’t this the view we saw from our room in Daikanso? I think Goto Juno stayed at Daikanso when he visited Matsushima, and it was one of the rooms on the third floor of our row facing the sea. This painting by Juno Goto was painted in 1987 and is called &quot;Morning on Matsushima&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ud8QPlbfKJzhSCfAI3lRj04aLAniveD7G2jmoqTK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/ud8QPlbfKJzhSCfAI3lRj04aLAniveD7G2jmoqTK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254356&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Autumn leaves at Entsu-in Temple, an affiliated temple of Zuigan-ji Temple. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, I stood in front of the window in the early morning and looked at the Matsushima sea view in front of me, and I thought of the Japanese cultural essayist In a passage from Hakushu Masako, she said, &quot;Japan is an isolated island in the East, and the good and the bad are all in the word &#39;iso&#39;. This isolated island is like a wind-swept corner of world culture. No matter what it is, as long as it passes through the hands of the Japanese, it will It will transform into something more indescribable, delicate, and dense.” I agree with this statement. There is no clear distinction between cultural forms, but there are completely different differences in rhythm, speed, and texture. Japanese culture is a condensed representation of world culture. Strong winds and waves transported various cultures to this island country in the Far East, and that&#39;s where it ended. Then, after being eliminated and transformed, they were condensed into a crystallized cultural form. Its static and density are completely different from mainland culture and corridor culture. The wind and waves stop here, but they are condensed in it, like a drop of amber between heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the scenery of Songdao in front of the window, I suddenly remembered these. During the trip, generally, abstract words will continue to stimulate my thinking, while visual beauty will make me quite distracted. Songdo is an exception. It seems that this is indeed an unusual Songdo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Small Path of the Oku&quot;, Basho&#39;s disciple Zeng Liang recited a haiku, &quot;On the pine island, the cuckoo should use the crane&#39;s body to sing throughout the bay.&quot; This haiku was engraved. The stele was erected at the entrance of Zuiyan Temple, juxtaposed with the &quot;Bajiao stele&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The core of Songdo is Zuiam Temple. Basho and Zeng Liang visited Ruiyan Temple in the summer, and they thought it was peaceful and peaceful. We arrived in mid-autumn, and the tranquility was still there, with the subtle yellow and red colors of autumn mixed in with it. The smell of the sky must be completely different. The sky in all four seasons is really wonderful, equally clear and high, but the autumn sky is more profound and vague, like a pair of eyes with deeper sockets, which is different from the other three seasons. Starting from Sendai Station, I saw Matsushima red foliage tourism promotion posters posted all the way. They were overwhelmingly popular. The poster selects the red leaves of Zuigan Temple, or to be precise, the red leaves of Entsuin Temple, an affiliated temple of Zuigan Temple. The courtyard of Yuantongyuan is winding and graceful. It is a courtyard specially prepared for autumn. It is planted with maple trees, which will be full of red in late autumn. What was it like when we arrived? Take the marathon as an analogy. The starting gun of Hongfeng has already sounded. Some runners have already rushed out, but the huge team is still at the starting point. Imagine that as soon as we walked away, the red leaves in Yuantongyuan would start running wildly on a large scale until the whole garden was burning. It would be impossible not to feel a little sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zuigan Temple is an important temple of the Rinzai Sect. It was built in 828 AD. There is a room in the temple where Emperor Meiji once stayed, which is specially marked. After walking around the main hall and cloisters along the tour route, my attention was focused on the garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once the autumn light settles, it is gray-blue. Especially in the morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning from Songdo, I often looked at the photos of the dry landscape garden at Zuiganji Temple. A wonderful scene separated by light. In the shadows, the white sand turns into a clear gray-blue. There are tiny wind and thunder in the wrinkles of the sand. The dark and light moss has a wonderful sense of exquisiteness. Beyond the shadows, in the strong light, the white walls and rocks, and the pine trees rolling down the cliff outside the temple, with the cluster of red leaves as the boundary, have lost their tension here and calmed down. But this stillness seems to be broken at any time, if the light changes slightly. As a result, those watching couldn&#39;t help but hold their breath. Therefore, it is right to freeze it into a photo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Art philosopher Professor Arthur Danto has studied Basho very well and believes that the texture of Basho haiku is &quot;quiet, concise, as crystal clear and cool as a diamond&quot;. He once said that he wanted to be like Basho. Basho&#39;s journey is a pilgrimage to art, nature and the heart. He is humorous, self-deprecating, proud and lonely, but has a strong sense of humility. He regards his ancestors, nature and the very act of tapping the ground with his feet. They all have very pious thoughts. His practice has been successfully completed in the process of practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Danto once said it well. He said, &quot;...Bashō, as an individual, exists in such a reality where the expression of personality and the disappearance of personality are unified. It is neither worldly nor independent. So out of the world; as he mocked himself, he was like a bat, neither a mouse nor a bird, but a hybrid shape-shifting creature between two animal states of existence. I was always moved by his travel notes . These travel notes are a symbol of the restlessness in his body. He always starts from a feeling or a hope for the end, with no intention of returning, in order to seek some ultimate escape. In the end, he discovers that escape itself is an achievement.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;As for Basho, I once said that I regard him as a literary lover. In other words, I want to be like him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“中国草”与“东方神药”的丝路之旅]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258912]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;With the arrival of the rainy season, the incidence of malaria on the African island of Sao Tome has begun to rise.

On the 16th, he drove a small truck and brought back a load of Juncao oyster mushroom waste from the China-aided Juncao Technology Demonstration Center in Fiji. This waste mushroom material can be used as organic fertilizer for fruits and vegetables on the farm. Two months ago, under the guidance of Chinese Juncao technical experts, Kumar was still planting Juncao on the landslide on the farm&#39;s river bank to control the worsening water and soil erosion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative was proposed, one after another &quot;small but beautiful&quot; projects that benefit people&#39;s livelihood have been implemented in countries along the initiative.

These giant grasses are several meters long, with thick stems, wide leaves and well-developed root systems. Even the tallest people in the crowd feel as if they are walking into a reed marsh as soon as they enter the grassland, and they are instantly overwhelmed by the green. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local people often pronounce Juncao as Junkao according to their English pronunciation habits. In fact, Juncao technology is an original technology that China has completely independent intellectual property rights. Until now, the international English name of Juncao is &quot;Juncao&quot; in Chinese pinyin. In 2001, China&#39;s first foreign aid Juncao technology demonstration base was built in Papua New Guinea. So far, this technology has been promoted to more than 100 countries and regions around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 22, 2023, the China-Pacific Island Countries Juncao Technology Demonstration Center was unveiled and launched in Fiji. Lin Xingsheng, an expert at the National Juncao Engineering Technology Research Center of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, came to Fiji in January this year. Since then, his tasks have become even heavier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In Fiji, Juncao can be used as high-quality feed for livestock and poultry, and can also be used to cultivate edible fungi—traditionally, it is a high-quality culture material for growing mushrooms.” He told Southern Weekend reporters that their Work includes production, scientific research, demonstration, training, promotion, etc. Since the implementation of Juncao technology in Fiji in 2014, more than 2,300 local Juncao technical talents have been trained, more than 700 farmers have grown Juncao mushrooms, and more than 1,000 farmers have developed Juncao farming, ending Fiji’s inability to The history of mushroom production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Juncao is full of treasures and can be used for many purposes.&quot; Lin Xingsheng said that in addition to &quot;replacing wood with grass&quot; as a culture substrate for edible and medicinal fungi, Juncao can also be used as a culture medium for cattle and sheep. and other livestock feed, effectively alleviating the dry season feed shortage problem in the arid western Fiji area and promoting the development of local animal husbandry. In addition, Juncao grows quickly and has a well-developed root system. It can also be used to prevent local soil erosion and improve saline-alkali land. Planting one hectare of giant fungus in Fiji can absorb more than 100 tons of carbon dioxide, which is an effective way to combat climate change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August 2023, with the help of Lin Xingsheng and other experts, Juncao was planted on the river bank of the farm of Kumar’s family, a local in Nadi. Just over a month has passed, and clumps of green grass have grown on the originally bare steep slopes. After entering the tillering stage and jointing stage, Juncao will grow faster and faster. Lin Xingsheng is &quot;confident&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Soil and water loss was very serious on the landslide before. When it rained, the sediment would rush into the river. Planting Juncao can effectively solidify the soil and store water. This is why we carry out Juncao slope protection and bank protection in Fiji to prevent soil and water loss. One of the demonstration sites of ecological governance.&quot; Lin Xingsheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the tall Juncao, Artemisia annua looks particularly &quot;weak&quot;. The ancient name of Artemisia annua is &quot;裣&quot;, which means &quot;grass that treats malaria&quot; and was first recorded in &quot;Shen Nong&#39;s Materia Medica&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 1,700 years ago, Ge Hong, a Taoist priest and medical scientist in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, left a record of artemisia annua against malaria in &quot;Emergency Prescriptions&quot; - &quot;A handful of artemisia annua, soak it with two liters of water, and wring it out. Just take it.&quot; This 15-character ancient prescription has inspired generations of Chinese medicine practitioners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tu Youyou, a researcher at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, was also inspired by this, changing the extraction method from high temperature to low temperature, and finally successfully discovered artemisinin, which has benefited millions of malaria patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 30, 2021, the World Health Organization announced that China had passed the malaria elimination certification. According to disclosed data, the number of local primary cases of malaria in China has dropped from 30 million per year before the founding of New China to &quot;zero for four consecutive years.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the advancement of the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s anti-malarial experience with Artemisia annua has also been introduced to other countries in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sao Tome and Principe (referred to as &quot;Sao Tome and Principe&quot;) is an island country in the west of the African continent with a population of about 220,000. The year here is divided into dry season and rainy season. Among them, during the rainy season from October to May of the following year, the humid and high temperature weather is very conducive to the breeding of mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are an important vector for the spread of malaria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 17, Huang Xinan, an associate researcher at the Artemisia Research Center of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, who is carrying out anti-malarial assistance in Sao Tome and Principe, told Southern Weekend reporters that while the rainy season has just begun, they must speed up monitoring and control. pace. Currently in Sao Tome, a village can be classified as an epidemic source village if there are more than 3 cases of malaria patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, a hospital in Água Grande, São Tomé City, reported three malaria cases. On October 16, they deployed manpower to carry out a large-scale malaria epidemic prevention and control operation in key epidemic source villages. Screening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Generally, we will determine the source village through feedback data from hospitals, epidemic control centers and other channels, and then work with malaria prevention team members to carry out case screening, drug distribution, mosquito disinfecting and other tasks.&quot; Huang Xinan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, in Liberdade, Dashui District, São Tomé City, the China Artemisia annua anti-malarial project team adopted a &quot;source elimination and malaria&quot; program that prioritized removing the source of infection to conduct an anti-malarial pilot . Prior to this, this village with a population of more than 600 had 300 to 400 malaria cases every year. After three rounds of medication, the team continued to carry out measures such as monitoring the floating population and investigating the infection rate. During the long rainy season that followed for eight months, there were no local cases of malaria infection in Liberty Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The success of the Free Village pilot has given the Sao Tome and Principe government and local WHO officials greater confidence in defeating malaria. Because of its immediate therapeutic effect, the Artemisia annua compound medicine distributed by the expert team was also called the &quot;Oriental Miracle Medicine&quot; by the villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/geojCBVSi5UwUXjMZ5rz4X4lMnNTkoO2NsMuWGgN.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1706&quot; height= &quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/geojCBVSi5UwUXjMZ5rz4X4lMnNTkoO2NsMuWGgN.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254646&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;With the help of Chinese Juncao technical experts, Juncao was planted on the river bank of Kumar&#39;s farm. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Business opportunities&quot; and connections&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Juncao mushroom cultivation project is It brings business opportunities to local farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Xingsheng, leader of the expert team of the China-aided Fiji Juncao Technology Demonstration Center, gave an example. The Fiji Juncao Center provides technical training to local farmers and provides fungus bags full of mycelium. After farmers receive the mushroom bags from the center, they can cultivate the mushrooms under the forest or in the shade of the shed by covering the soil with soil. They only need simple management measures such as simple watering and maintenance, lifting the film for ventilation, and the first crop of oyster mushrooms can be harvested in about 7-10 days. , you can have income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Fiji, ordinary farmers only need to plant 10 square meters of Juncao oyster mushrooms in front of and behind their houses. If they plant 4 times a year, they can harvest 1,200 kilograms of fresh oyster mushrooms and earn 20,000 Fijian dollars. The equivalent of RMB is almost over 60,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is much higher than the annual income of ordinary local farmers, so the locals call the Juncao project ‘quick money, easy money’ (money is easy and fast).” Lin Xingsheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Rwanda, a country in central and eastern Africa, the economic benefits of growing mushrooms also attract ordinary farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Xiaobin, leader of the expert team of China’s Juncao Technology Demonstration Center in Rwanda, told Southern Weekend reporters that Rwanda has a large population but little land and underdeveloped industry. Local workers have low incomes, with an average daily income of only 9 yuan. Through the simple and easy-to-operate Juncao technology, ordinary people only need a small piece of open land and basic care to grow cash crops that make money quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with previous local mushroom growing technologies, China’s Juncao mushroom growing technology has low cost, high yield and easy operation, and is welcomed by many mushroom growers. In neighboring countries adjacent to Rwanda, such as Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mushroom merchants also go to border trading points to purchase fresh mushrooms. The ever-expanding domestic and foreign market demand has also stimulated the enthusiasm of mushroom growers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to growing mushrooms in mushroom bags, some people are also studying mushroom bag production technology to achieve &quot;technical localization.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Nadi, Fiji, farmer Ashniel is an expert at growing mushrooms. Not only did he fully master the management technology of Juncao mushrooms, he also learned to produce mushroom bags independently. At the same time, he also modified a humidifier to adjust the humidity in the mushroom-producing place. The oyster mushrooms he grows have thick flesh and good quality, which not only attracts many people to visit and study, but is also favored by customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Rwanda, many locals who come for training are college students with higher education. After completing their studies, they started their own business and sold fungus bags to local farmers for a fee. According to preliminary statistics, there are about 50 local companies and cooperatives that independently produce mushroom bags. According to Chen Xiaobin, in Rwanda, Chinese Juncao technology is a symbol of high-quality mushrooms. Mushroom growers or mushroom bag manufacturers will rush to put the &quot;Juncao Technology&quot; label on their products when promoting their products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the introduction of Juncao mushroom cultivation technology, Chinese mushrooms have also quietly integrated into the local food culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Xiaobin of the Rwanda Juncao Technology Demonstration Center said that every time when training students, teachers will arrange cooking classes to demonstrate various ways of eating mushrooms. &quot;Such as deep-frying, stir-frying, mushroom soup, etc.&quot; After students read it, they will also make innovations based on local eating habits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Fiji, mushroom growers process the mushrooms and add cassava flour and other materials to turn them into mushroom drinks. In Rwanda, Sambusa (the Chinese call it Triangle) is a traditional pasta made of dough and stuffing. Bao), in addition to regular fillings such as potatoes, beef, and onions, recently the hot-selling mushrooms have also been added. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Eastern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea (referred to as &quot;PNG&quot;), the first stop for &quot;Juncao going overseas&quot;, the Juncao and upland rice industries have become the second and third largest industries in the region after coffee. three major agricultural industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early 2000, China&#39;s Fujian Province and Papua New Guinea&#39;s Eastern Highlands Province signed a sister province agreement, listing Juncao and upland rice technology as Fujian Province&#39;s assistance projects to Eastern Highlands Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Yingxing, leader of the expert team of China’s Juncao Technology Demonstration Base in Papua New Guinea, told Southern Weekend reporters that over the years, the Juncao project’s promotion area in Papua New Guinea, the number of participating farmers, training personnel, and experts have increased significantly. improve. Currently, subdivided projects such as Juncao mushroom cultivation, Juncao livestock husbandry, and upland rice cultivation have been promoted to many provinces in the country, benefiting more than 10,000 farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report by the &quot;PNG Courier&quot; on October 4, 2023, this project has become a model for the &quot;One Belt, One Road&quot; cooperation between China and Papua New Guinea. The friendly relations between the new Eastern Highlands provinces played an important role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/DcAQuuhEf58ZJEm5CWhquZSmUTKwD0tQyhU0KgGe.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1706&quot; height= &quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/DcAQuuhEf58ZJEm5CWhquZSmUTKwD0tQyhU0KgGe.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254645&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In Nadi, Fiji, the oyster mushrooms grown by farmer Ashniel have thick flesh and good quality.

In 2020, the region accounted for 95% of the global total of malaria cases and 96% of the global malaria deaths. An estimated 80% of malaria deaths in the region occur among children under 5 years of age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2006, Deng Changsheng, an associate researcher at the Artemisia annua Research Center of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, provided anti-malarial assistance in the African island nation of Comoros. He saw from preliminary survey data that at that time, about 60% of outpatient cases in medical institutions in Comoros were malaria. More than half of the hospitalized cases were malaria patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It can be said that malaria was the most troublesome health problem in this country at that time.” He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Comoros at that time, many residents were accustomed to collecting rainwater in cellars during the rainy season for use in the dry season. During field research, Deng Changsheng saw mosquito larvae crawling densely in the water cellars of many residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poor drinking water environment is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the spread of malaria. Even in recent years, the malaria situation in Africa is still not optimistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Song Jianping, director of the Artemisia annua Research Center of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, told Southern Weekend reporters that in 2017, the team conducted random checks among about 150,000 people in the Est-Mono region of Togo, Africa. Among more than 2,000 people randomly checked, the infection rate among the sample population was as high as 80%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to extremely high infection rates, many African countries have very weak anti-malarial medical systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many African countries have a common problem, that is, there is no primary medical care, or there is an urgent shortage of emergency doctors.” According to Song Jianping, people with malaria are unable to seek medical treatment for various reasons after they develop symptoms. Some residents need to spend their own money for tests and high-priced drugs; some residents have inconvenient transportation and cannot reach regular hospitals. If it cannot be detected in time, it will be impossible to achieve the effect of early treatment and early prevention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, Chinese artemisia annua anti-malarial experts, including Song Jianping’s team, have launched artemisia annua anti-malarial campaigns in African countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Comoros, his team implemented a campaign of universal administration of artemisinin compound to eliminate the source of infection, curbing the country&#39;s malaria epidemic and achieving zero malaria deaths. In Papua New Guinea, only one year after the project was implemented, the average population infection rate was 0.07%, a decrease of more than 99%, and zero malaria deaths were achieved. In Sao Tome, the project team has gradually established a three-level anti-malaria system of &quot;Ministry of Health - County - Village&quot; in São Tomé and Principe. According to the malaria incidence rate and the number of outbreaks, targeted early intervention is carried out in high-incidence villages to suppress malaria outbreaks. Popularity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Over the years, these programs have been verified by millions of people in many countries, and there is very rich clinical data. The data proves that the Chinese programs are effective and immediate. For compound artemisia annua anti- We are very confident in our plan to combat malaria,&quot; Deng Changsheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Jianping believes that malaria prevention and control is a complex and huge task. In terms of the drug itself, the compound artemisia annua antimalarial regimen has its own advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that the team is constantly optimizing the drug ratio in anti-malarial drugs so that it can maintain the advantages of artemisinin’s high cure rate while reducing adverse reactions and taking rounds as much as possible. Suitable for large-scale drug administration sites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The incidence rate of adverse reactions of some drugs is as high as 20 to 30%, which can cause fear in patients.

After the expansion, the types of personal pension insurance products include exclusive commercial pension insurance, endowment insurance, annuity insurance and tax-deferred pension products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/8eefa46488519beb1678d58511f85dc7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;734&quot; height=&quot;556&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/8eefa46488519beb1678d58511f85dc7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254620&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;(Picture source:&amp;nbsp;China Bank &amp; Credit Insurance Co., Ltd.)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above 18 items are included in personal pension Financial tax-deferred pension products are provided by China Pacific Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Taiping Pension Insurance Co., Ltd., Ping An Pension Insurance Co., Ltd., Taikang Pension Insurance Co., Ltd., Taiping Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and Generali Life Insurance Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Kaiyuan Securities research report shows that the integration of tax-deferred commercial pension insurance into personal pensions mainly helps policyholders of tax-deferred pension insurance to coordinate and unify the third pillar tax preferential policies and reduce the personal income tax rate when receiving them. , which is conducive to the further improvement of the personal pension system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, on August 31, the State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau issued the &quot;Notice on Matters Concerning the Connection between the Pilot Program of Personal Tax-Deferred Commercial Pension Insurance and Personal Pensions.&quot; The main content of the &quot;Notice&quot; includes clarifying the work requirements, business adjustments, product management, policy transfer, etc. in the process of connecting the tax-deferred pension insurance pilot and personal pensions, and also clarifies the customer information confirmation and strengthens system construction for China Banking and Credit Insurance Co., Ltd. , as well as requirements for business operations, announcements and information submissions of tax-deferred pension insurance pilot insurance companies. In principle, all work should be completed before the end of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industry insiders said that personal tax-deferred pension insurance highlights the &quot;burden reduction&quot; effect, and the tax burden after retirement is lighter. The expansion of the list means that the connection between the tax-deferred pension insurance business and the personal pension system is progressing in an orderly manner, in line with work expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2018, the Ministry of Finance and other departments jointly issued the &quot;Notice on Launching the Pilot of Personal Tax-Deferred Commercial Pension Insurance&quot;, launching the pilot business operation in the country. The pilot areas are Shanghai, Fujian and Suzhou Industrial Parks, and the maximum pre-tax deduction amount is 6% of personal taxable income or 12,000 yuan per year, whichever is lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ping An Securities stated that the pilot policy is not attractive to low-income people, and the tax benefits are limited for those who can enjoy tax benefits. Under the personal pension system, there are more product choices and simpler tax deduction procedures. The two types of products have similar attributes and share tax preferential quotas. The integration of tax-deferred commercial pension insurance into personal pensions will straighten out the relationship between tax-advantaged pension insurance. Relevant procedures will be simplified to make it easier for investors to understand. At the same time, it will further enrich the selection of personal pension products and increase investors&#39; willingness to insure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the official implementation of the personal pension system in November 2022, personal pension insurance products have continued to expand. According to the official website of China Banking and Insurance Corporation, by the end of July 2023, the number of personal pension insurance products has increased from The initial 7 models were expanded to 48 products, and currently it has been expanded to 69 products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ping An Securities stated that residents’ demand for retirement savings continues to expand under the background of an aging population. However, since this year, long-term interest rates have remained low and volatile, many commercial banks have lowered deposit interest rates, the equity market has fluctuated greatly, and the returns of competing products have Rates have declined, and insurance products follow pricing interest rates, have guaranteed yields, and can provide protection against risks such as death, total disability, and disability, further highlighting their differentiated advantages. As an important part of the third pillar of pension insurance, commercial pension insurance is expected to achieve rapid development under the personal pension system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 17:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[社会学家刘汶蓉：年轻人的很多选择无法成为“现实选择”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258959]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details of relevant reports, please see: &quot;&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/258684&quot; title=&quot;Documentary &quot;The Nest&quot;: Why do two generations who torture each other still live together&quot;>;Documentary &quot;The Nest&quot;: Two generations who torture each other Why do modern people still live together&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The documentary &quot;The Nest&quot; focuses on a family of three in Shanghai. A young man born in 1985 graduated from school many years ago and lives with his parents in a 30-square-meter apartment. Husband’s room. Liu Wenrong, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, paid attention to this documentary. She is very familiar with such families. 2016 was the year when the documentary started to be filmed. She was doing research on intergenerational relations at the time and discovered the group of families that “gnaw at the elderly”: “There were already many such cases in 2016, but now the employment situation of young people is more difficult. Severe, and their expectations are different, so there are more and more people. The earliest was in 2005 or 2006, Shanghai started to &#39;gnaw&#39;, because housing prices became more expensive, and the elderly felt more and more pressure to support their children. When I came to college, there was a wave of discussion about the issue of &#39;gnawing at the elderly.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Wenrong began to pay attention to and study the intergenerational relationship issues in Chinese society when she was studying for her Ph.D. In the first decade of the 21st century, scholars engaged in qualitative research devoted a lot of space to discussing issues such as the decline of filial piety, the pension crisis, and intergenerational imbalance. Her doctoral thesis that year also stemmed from wanting to test the theory of &quot;the decline of filial piety,&quot; but it led her in another direction. In 2008, when she analyzed survey data from Lanzhou and Shanghai, she found that intergenerational relationships were getting closer, and that younger people were more likely to agree with the concept of filial piety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2012 to 2019, she and the research team visited Shanghai, Lanzhou, Dalian and other places, collected 137 family cases, and collected 11 family cases in the United States. Combined with the sample survey data, she finally came to the conclusion: Social transformation has strengthened the emotional structure of &quot;parent-child integration&quot; in Chinese families. The tradition of intergenerational mutual aid has shown strong resilience. Intergenerational ties still play a community role in settling individual lives and motivating daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During field research, Liu Wenrong met many Chinese young people who were supported and supported by their families. During her research in the United States, she communicated with local scholars and saw the contrast between Eastern and Western families. touch. In addition, she has the identity and experience of a mother, and her mentality has changed. In the past, she was disgusted with China&#39;s family culture and believed that &quot;moral kidnapping&quot; was too heavy. Now she believes that this is a warm system design. Chinese urban families bear the burden of young people&#39;s unemployment, marriage and childbearing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/G1B26cwWmFMgurABuZhU54FAwqVtFsddRwNjeouX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2160&quot; height= &quot;1215&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/G1B26cwWmFMgurABuZhU54FAwqVtFsddRwNjeouX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254708&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;em>;In the documentary &quot;The Nest&quot;, the protagonist born in 1985 (left) lives with his parents who are over 70 years old.

We must respect the inheritance of culture and transform it. This does not mean that transformation is What can be transformed requires profound ideological transformation, which is a relatively long process.&quot; Liu Wenrong told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Liu Wenrong has shifted her research focus to young people’s marriage and love, and is working on the topic “Research on the Trends, Dilemmas and Social Processes of Marriage and Love among Young People in Big Cities”. In an interview with Southern Weekend reporters, she talked about intergenerational conflicts in families in transition, the phenomenon of stay-at-home sons and daughters, and the plight of youth in the information society, among other topics. The following is his self-report:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Once children no longer get married and have children, it will be difficult for them to truly reconcile with their parents&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For those of us born in the 1970s, especially in our youth, we have very Strong motivation to leave home. why? Parental control is very painful, and the love we feel is very little, because when you have many children, your parents allocate very little time and energy, including financial resources. In this state, children do not need to be evaluated. It is almost a natural motivation, that is, they must study away from them at a very early age, and they must earn money to support themselves. This motivation is very strong. You must also get married, because once you get married, you can leave that family with confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this dynamic, it can be said that we were all a matter of survival at that time. We also want self-realization. Since childhood, we have thought about painting, singing, writing, etc., but most people just regard it as an ideal buried in their hearts. First of all, you must meet your own needs, find a job, get married, and have a support network of peers in society. Our support mainly relies on friends and classmates. This network is very important, and we are willing to spend time and energy to make such relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But today&#39;s young people have very little pressure to survive from their parents. They spend a lot of energy and thoughts on why their ideals cannot be realized, which makes them very powerless, because they The standard of self-realization is relatively high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I think young people will be unhappy if such words are said, I know that their experiences are different and they cannot understand. My research also found that it is difficult for generations to understand each other because they do not have similar experiences or similar social roles. They have to rely more on their parents because their parents are more mature than them. For example, a harmonious family relies on the compromises of the parents. Whether it is done naturally or shaped after reflection, it must have achieved profound ideological comfort and tolerance. Without this, it would be difficult, because the children do not have similar life paths and experiences, and it is difficult to reach spiritual reconciliation with their parents. Even if they also agree with filial piety and the importance of love, it is difficult to produce such a thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So this is also a dilemma that families have on people&#39;s spirits, especially now that after the transformation, the path of life is no longer standardized or copied, and each person is individualized. I later published a book specifically discussing the emotional transformation of intergenerational relationships in Chinese families. My final conclusion was to talk about the role of childbirth in the value recognition and emotional communication between two generations. Many young people only reach spiritual reconciliation with their parents after they get married and have children. If he has not become a parent, it will be difficult for him to truly understand his parents and let go of the harm his parents have done to him. Only when he stands in the same role and has his own emotional experience with his own children, can he truly realize the difficulties of being a parent and discover that no matter how good his intentions are, there are still many dissatisfactions and many unsatisfactory consequences. He cannot control the situation and cannot be a perfect parent. At this time, he can let go of some things his parents did in his upbringing and understand that the upbringing process is not easy. This reconciliation is actually very subtle. During my investigation, parents will naturally feel the tacit understanding between them (and their children), and they will feel relieved mentally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do Chinese parents care so much about their children getting married and having children? The issue of carrying on the family line is basically not emphasized by Chinese parents nowadays. They think it is a feudal idea, especially educated parents. But why do I still pursue this thing? I always feel that there is something wrong with it, that is, the difficult path of becoming a parent is not recognized. This is a huge loss in their value, and this sense of loss cannot be expressed in the modern value system. Parents don’t talk about these things on the Internet, and even in daily life, they don’t know why they are like this. In fact, it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t been recognized, and I don&#39;t know what I have been busy with all my life. But when children give birth to children, they get a kind of spiritual understanding and relief, and a recognition of value. This is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The vitality of Chinese family culture lies in inheritance, which is a cycle, not linear. But once children no longer get married and have children, it is actually difficult for them to understand the struggles in marriage and parenting, and it is difficult for them to truly reconcile with their parents psychologically. Therefore, I think the culture of voluntary non-marriage and childbearing that is emerging among young people is a very big challenge that Chinese families are currently facing in the social transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have all experienced a period of rapid economic development, and there was not such strong information dissemination in adolescence. We also naturally enjoyed the dividends of the development of this era without any deliberate reflection. But today&#39;s young people grow up in a completely different stage of social development, and they face very big spiritual challenges. We need more intergenerational understanding. We cannot say that today&#39;s teenagers are all hypocritical and nihilistic, that they are flat, have no ambition, or are lazy. In every era there are people who are unable to enter society because of some psychological or personality problems. But if this group of people is particularly large, it becomes a social problem. What we need is understanding and communication between generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, we are also worried about the issue of marriage and love among young people. The mainstream society is very worried, and the country is also very worried. Why are we not willing to get married? Why don&#39;t you want to have children? I think it is more important to understand that it is important to make young people recognize the path of marriage and having children from their hearts, and to tell them the significance of intimate relationships to people&#39;s mental health and long-term development. Because being unmarried and having children is mostly a form of self-protection for young people who are under a sense of risk. If they lack support, they can only focus on the present. Therefore, we need to think about the spirituality and psychology of family life in an all-round way culturally. Or, more society-wide discussions are needed so that everyone can have more understanding of the institution of marriage and intimate relationships, and create more possibilities and space for personal path choices. Our government has always said that it supports marriage and childbearing by providing money and time. I think there is also a need for more guidance on the value aspect, or for young people to recognize it more. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“What we worry about is that young people will never be able to leave the family”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In urban middle-class families, children born after 1995 are more likely to return to their parents. My article, &quot;The Return of Parental Rights and the Reconstruction of Filial Piety in Urban Families in the Transformation Period,&quot; is a response to the phenomenon that there are more and more &quot;mama&#39;s babies&quot; and children are willing to listen to their parents for many things and have a close relationship and emotional intimacy with their parents. In daily life, they are a little rebellious, but there is no conflict with their parents on major issues. Whether it is the concept of choosing a spouse, the concept of employment, or the concept of entering school, they seem to be very similar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For middle-class parents, they have completely changed the past &quot;paternalistic&quot; parenting model. In the article, I call it reflexive parenting practice, which is when parents reflect on the pain in their own growth experiences, form a parenting style based on love and emotion, and comprehensively plan and plan the growth path of their children. Help and hope your children will be happy and successful. On the other hand, even middle-class parents have different resources. Parents born in the 1980s and those born in the 1950s have not accumulated much wealth and are still under great financial pressure. But things are different after 1995. The economic situation of the entire society has developed greatly, especially those who are middle-class or above and have college-educated parents. They generally have better careers, better economic accumulation, and better knowledge accumulation. Socially The capital and economic capital are relatively good in all aspects, so I can devote myself to the upbringing of my children in an all-round way, and it is a kind of close parenting and intensive upbringing since childhood. This kind of intimate parenting uses emotional influence and guidance, and there is less brutal coercive control behavior. Therefore, children do not have so much tension and conflict with their parents when they grow up, and even in adolescence they still show a high degree of dependence on their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I feel that mental health problems are particularly serious among those born in the 2000s and 10s. This is of course related to academics, but it is also closely related to the long-term family structure, that is, the symbiosis between generations. The child was cared for and packed with love that took his breath away. Whether children are at school or at home, they are completely monitored. In this case, it will be difficult for children to be mentally healthy, and they will have a strong sense of powerlessness, so depression among teenagers is also increasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our Chinese familism is the state of parent-child integration, which has a strong instrumental function in life support. For example, in the process of my country&#39;s economic transformation, there has not been a large number of young people living in poverty, all of whom are supported by their parents. There has not been a large number of young people who cannot get married, have fallen into poverty, or even become homeless. This is all because of the lack of parental support in Chinese families. On the bottom, so this is a benefit in a tool sense. But now that we are in the second decade of the 21st century, what we see is more mental pressure and pressure on the development of young people. What we are worried about is that young people will never be able to get out of their families and are trapped inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan also has a similar situation. When economic development slows down or even stagnates, young people have fewer opportunities to obtain stable and good jobs and good marriages. Parents protect their children. They call it the phenomenon of &quot;staying single&quot;. They just stay with their parents, never get married, and some of them don&#39;t even work. I read some information and found that these children who have been single until old age are likely to fall into a state of singlelessness after the death of their parents, which is also a very big social problem. Will we also reach this point? What should we do when human survival is no longer a problem and development faces bottlenecks? Is it a way out for parents to protect their children? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have no objection to children having full-time jobs, but parents should be smart parents and their children should be smart children. There is no problem with periodic gaps, because now you have the conditions to pursue a better career, a higher education, and a better marriage partner. The period of adulthood will inevitably become longer and longer, but you must realize that you cannot Always like this. Childhood status is indefinite, but as a full-time child, there is a concept of a contract. I can terminate the contract and change jobs. It is a profession, temporary, not lifelong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both parents and children must make their own preparations for changing jobs or changing professional status. They cannot just accept this state of mind by saying &quot;I am fine this way&quot; and keep it like this. Unless you are engaged in a creative job, (for example) writing at home, but you still have to have a way to support yourself, because if your source of value is not independent, your self-efficacy will definitely be very low, and it will definitely be from a mental health point of view. Not a long-term solution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Westerners summarize the Chinese family as a corporation model - thinking that the Chinese family is a cooperative. In fact, a corporation is also an organization based on a rational structure and a business. Organizations and careers need to develop, and development needs to continue to grow. But I think these young people have not inherited this familialist view. They have reduced their efforts to build a larger intimate circle because the risks from the outside world are too great. In fact, for their families, there is no development and no future. In other words, between these two generations, it is over when it is over. This is not our Chinese familism tradition. He is just satisfied with his simplest idea of ​​filial piety, that is, I am a good person, I honor my parents, my parents love me, and I love them too. I work hard to make my parents live a good life, and that&#39;s it. The moral value of my life. Therefore, this &quot;return to filial piety&quot; is indeed the true state of mind of today&#39;s young people, but it is by no means a simple return to tradition. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;This trend makes people live a very abstract life&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, young people have relatively high demands, including the standards for marriage and love, which are very complicated. I support young people&#39;s spiritual pursuits and love pursuits, but it is difficult to add practical considerations to these pursuits. When I did research on marriage and love, I found that all the investigators had no way to avoid it. In the end, choosing a spouse was an economic indicator, but economics alone could not completely convince them, so they were very confused. The psychological complexity is very strong. Unlike those of us born in the 1970s who have a very strong drive to leave home, we really don’t think about it that much. Because families with many children at that time had limited resources and parents were generally impatient with their children, young people had to go to other places to go to school, get a job, get married, and build their own life network. Behind this was a motivation closer to survival needs, so they had to work hard. , the partner&#39;s pursuit of idealization and perfection is relatively weak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now the information and reference standards of the entire society are different. The current network and information dissemination are too developed, giving people a strong sense of powerlessness. You always feel that there are endless possibilities, but the reality is not like that. The people he refers to are always the best ones. He cannot be satisfied with the people and things around him, including himself, and lives a very unhappy life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, it will be difficult for young people to live in the concrete life in front of them, causing them to fall into a great sense of powerlessness. &quot;I will not settle, I will work hard&quot; is both a personality statement and a risk aversion. In fact, they don&#39;t work hard because there is no way to work hard. Human energy and strength are limited, and you can only work hard near yourself. As the old saying goes, you have to do it step by step. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was easy for us to do it at that time, but why is it so difficult for young people to do it now? It’s not that young people are bad, it’s because changes in the entire society have led to changes in people’s psychological environment. Therefore, if you want to do some reverse self-training, you must do it through deliberate, conscious, and profound self-discipline. You cannot do it if you follow this trend. Because under this trend, there seems to be a cultural environment that makes people live very abstract and unrealistic lives. And at that time, even if we were looking for a job, we didn&#39;t seem to feel uncomfortable or uncomfortable, because everyone was like this, it was not unacceptable, and most people were in this state. This is also the progress of a society. Survival is no longer a problem. Only now young people will think, &quot;I don&#39;t want to settle, I want to pursue my own most ideal state.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also the background of a risk society, which is caused by fear. This is also very important. We have to look at where a young person focuses his attention. The higher he focuses his attention, the more fearful he will be, and the stronger his sense of powerlessness will be. But this era is an attention economy, and what attracts people is always those lofty things. Consumerism and Internet culture are all like this. Most of them satisfy people&#39;s physiological stimulation and stimulate people&#39;s desires. This desire will temporarily make you excited or satisfied, or create a beautiful imagination, but it It will not support you step by step in life for a long time. That’s why I say that young people live very abstract lives. I don’t want to use other words, such as derogatory words such as impetuous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has become very difficult to &quot;adult&quot; now. It is very difficult to identify and stabilize oneself. Of course, people have to be in this process of getting to know themselves throughout their lives, but it is difficult for a young person to enter the next stage of growth because he cannot distinguish, cannot make a choice, and is always in this entangled state. And today&#39;s Internet culture, consumer culture, and games all make young people indulge in this stage more and more, and they remain underage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They have always been unable to distinguish between desires and ideals: in fact, they are satisfying their short-term desires, not walking on the ideal path, because they have not been implemented in reality. The atmosphere created by our culture makes them feel that they are on this road, creating the illusion that they are very pursuing, ideal, and struggling. In this way, they miss the best state of their life cycle and slowly and naturally slide. In fact, many studies have noticed, including Japanese research and surveys on youth, that it is not that young people plan to remain unmarried and have children. They firmly establish &quot;I am an unmarried and infertile person&quot; from the beginning. Yes, but it is not a big deal. most people. It&#39;s just that in the process of looking for a partner and exploring their own ideals, they slipped to the end of being single. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think young people still need to have a better understanding. It is indeed the influence of the entire environment. Social, cultural, psychological, and economic aspects are actually an oppression of the human spirit by the entire modernity. If you go further up, you will reach this (level), which is very obvious among young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Nowadays young people do not have the opportunity to fall in love for a long time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When you are in your twenties, you seem to have unlimited possibilities, and when you are forty, it seems that there are still many possibilities. But the fact that you are in reality and look around you and there seems to be no chance is very frustrating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did research on marriage and love, and found that young people think there are many opportunities and there are many platforms on the Internet. There seem to be a lot of choices, but in the end, none of them are choices, or there is no way to become a realistic choice. This is the dilemma of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This choice is different from what we had back then. Let me just talk about one point. It’s very interesting that college students don’t fall in love now, but high school students seem to still do it. But why don’t they fall in love in college? Moreover, they don’t seek help from their own units after they start working, because they will feel embarrassed if they fail! This reason sounds incredible at first, but when I think about it carefully, I think it is quite right. It is very rational. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Love requires time, emotional cultivation, and long-term contact with each other. My investigation revealed that they work very hard to go on blind dates every weekend and only once a week. They rack their brains to talk to people and even participate in various blind dates. But after the event is over, that person will no longer be around you. Even if you think this person is okay at the time, if he doesn&#39;t appear next to you within this week, you will see him again on the weekend at most. Many people will stick to it for two or three times and then it will be boring. And the key is that the conditions will not be so good that you will be desperate. The conditions may be okay, but if you think about it again, there are still many things you are not satisfied with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a rational measurement. If you measure based on conditions, you will always be dissatisfied. It is impossible for a person to be good at everything and fully meet all conditions. The long-term relationship does not depend on the conditions. Even if the conditions are average but there is love, they will be together. This is often the case. But now young people don&#39;t have this opportunity, they don&#39;t have the opportunity to develop feelings, because they have no daily contact at all, and even some events happen to touch you. In this case, if you don&#39;t have feelings, you will completely depend on the conditions, and you will always be dissatisfied depending on the conditions, so it will be difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This society seems to have a lot of choices, but in fact because you have no real contact, there are few opportunities and few options nearby. Moreover, they are afraid of entering specific relationships in real life. They are very afraid of the risk of relationship breakdown or unhappiness. They are worried about being hurt and entangled in the relationship. They are very worried and wary about investing in interpersonal relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know if this is a common problem among only children. That is, they have a strong sense of interpersonal boundaries. They are worried and afraid of complicated relationships, and naturally form a distance from others. They want to choose themselves wherever they go. come out. And in our era of having many children, we have been involved in various relationships since we were young, and we must have suffered a lot. However, it seems that we have naturally developed a lack of fear, thinking that this is a normal state, or developing a physiological response to cope with it. Okay, so are the skills. Nowadays, young people who are protected by their parents, or only children, do not have this ability, and they are not willing to get involved in interpersonal relationships. They think that is very low, they like to be alone, and they need their own space. So I think these are all changes of the times and a negative consequence of the progress of the times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of my students said that she just needs to be with her parents. There are indeed such children and such thoughts: I don’t need to establish such a strong and close relationship with anyone in this world. Because building a close relationship requires a lot of adjustment, a lot of discomfort, and very big challenges. Tolerance and various compromises between people, in short, they are not willing to do it. They think it is too complicated. They can play with it once or twice, but it is difficult to have in-depth communication. So I think they would rather go on a blind date. Some students even said, Teacher, it would be great if the country gave us a spouse. They are willing to follow dramas and have sex, and the sweetness of love is used up, and they no longer need to find the feeling of love in real life. Because there is no such perfect person, let him have that kind of emotion, thinking that two people are so sweet and in love with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at others falling in love, if you want to start a family, &quot;the country will send me one.&quot; So they are very receptive to introductions from their parents. Of course, their parents&#39; values ​​are relatively close to theirs, and they can coordinate their opinions on mate selection, so they accept their parents&#39; arrangements, which is completely different from what we expected at the time. What we originally thought was that with the development of modernization and the improvement of education, marriage must be a free love model. But it doesn&#39;t seem to be the case now. Love is love, but marriage is well arranged by parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this is not a large-scale survey, and it may be difficult to reflect it in a large-scale survey. But I have seen national survey data before, which shows that compared with the 1990s, the role of parents in their children&#39;s marriage decisions has increased after the 21st century. I think this is natural, mainly for economic reasons. Nowadays, when young people get married, they have to rely on their parents for every step of buying a house, giving gifts, and looking after children. In addition, young people&#39;s psychological dependence on their parents has also increased, so parents&#39; voice will definitely increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
