At the book rental shop in front of the school, he avoided Jin Yong, Gu Long, and Liang Yusheng, who were all reading, and picked up a copy of Freud&#39;s &quot;Introduction to Psychoanalysis.&quot; Later, because I despised popular philosophy, I read a few pages of Hegel&#39;s &quot;Little Logic&quot;. He has studied Shakespeare&#39;s sonnets and pondered the differences between ancient and modern English expressions. After watching &quot;007&quot;, he went to the bar to imitate James Bond and order a Martini. He was once a professional music student, playing the guqin since elementary school. He gained his rock and roll enlightenment from Radiohead&#39;s &quot;Ok, Computer&quot; and has been playing in the band for more than ten years. He mainly plays guitar, plays drums, is the lead singer, does programming, and plays bass. He was admitted to the Conservatory of Music, dropped out after one year and was admitted to the Beijing Film Academy. He struggled for nearly ten years to become a director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This all explains his excitement when he saw the novel &quot;The Pretender Revelation&quot;. &quot;Closing the book, I thought, probably no one is better at filming this than me. Clear yet euphemistic, hypocritical yet sincere, timid yet brave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the TV series &quot;Pretend&quot;, adapted from the novel of the same name, &quot;Revelations&quot; was broadcast, with a Douban score of 8.1, becoming his third Douban score of 8 after &quot;I&#39;m Very Good in a Foreign Country&quot; (2021, a score of 8.1) and &quot;Sanyue Has a New Job&quot; (2022, a score of 8.4) The above works.

In &quot;Sanyue Has a New Job&quot;, the protagonist Zhao Sanyue accidentally works as a makeup artist in a funeral parlor, witnessing the life and death of the deceased, and reflecting the portraits of all living beings. The story of &quot;Apocalypse of Pretending&quot; takes place in Beijing CBD. Investment banking elite Xu Ziquan and lawyer Tang Ying meet. While coping with the pressure of work, they try their best to maintain an elegant urban life. From testing each other to gradually letting go of their guard, they Come together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Mo, who was born in 1988, experienced similar difficulties. After graduating from college, he played the piano, made movies, wrote novels, became a teacher, and almost took the Ph.D. exam, saying that he &quot;wanted everything.&quot; Finally, under the guidance of his mentor, he carefully read the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; and &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;, calmed down to get inspiration from religion, and was more sure of the answer in his heart: &quot;I just want to do the work of expression and creation. I You can experience a different life.&quot; Being a director is his current way of expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/MBhjCuHSJicaNAGq0yKfmTzIsjDx8iMtxu5Jiqj8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/MBhjCuHSJicaNAGq0yKfmTzIsjDx8iMtxu5Jiqj8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250969&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills of &quot;The Apocalypse&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Mo&#39;s WeChat name is Mephisto (Mephisto), and his WeChat signature is: &quot;I can give you everything you want, but you just pay yourself.&quot; (I can give you everything you want, but you have to pay your soul.) They come from the poetic drama &quot;Faust&quot; created by the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the book, Faust is getting old, studying in a dark study for half his life, and feels extremely tired. At this time, the demon Mephisto comes and lures him to sign an agreement: to satisfy everything he had during his lifetime. Asked to take his soul until his death. This is also a bet between Mephisto and God. In pursuit of truth, Faust went through many hardships and traveled all the paths that humans have pursued. He often failed and sank, but he did not give up and finally gained salvation. Li Mo likes this work very much and has read it many times. He feels that Faust and Mephisto are the two sides of human beings. &quot;As people grow up, the soul seems to be less and less important. I wrote that sentence in my signature, hoping that all the people I know will think of this when they see it: If it is not so important, it will be in you. If you don’t even explore it, how about selling your soul? After Faust experienced everything, he found that the soul is the most important. This is the meaning of Mephisto. I want to be a Mephisto by my side People, remind everyone, remind me, give you everything, sell your soul, okay?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/09/16/C9UzP4aOLdFWxcahhdVh9OxRytG7qk1xOTnIljuN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16 /C9UzP4aOLdFWxcahhdVh9OxRytG7qk1xOTnIljuN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250972&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Director Li Mo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;Powerlessness&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is the most&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;ability&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong >;The dilemma of urbanites that makes me empathize&lt;/strong>;——Conversation with Li Mo&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Positive expression of &quot;I love you&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly ：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In &quot;The Apocalypse of Pretending&quot;, Xu Ziquan wrote a perfume name for Tang Ying, but it was not the one in the original work One. There are many similar details in the play. Did you change these? Why do we need to change this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The model in the original book has been discontinued. A lot of the modifications were made in the hope that it would become closer to the present. I predict that people will be sensitive to these things. For example, the Le Labo balm that Xu Ziquan used on the plane at the beginning of the play was not mentioned in the original work. That is one of my personal favorites. I find it very convenient and can take it with me on the plane at any time. Later I learned that that one had also been discontinued, but it was still in production when I was writing the script. I want to change the TV series to be closer to some of my life (actual situations), and the wine used in it is also the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How the props are presented is part of the expression. This is not about selling goods. I think people like him probably use such things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why is there a proposal scene in the ending? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Many lines are carried over from the book, but the act of proposing is not in the book. Because the play is over, I hope to give the audience a sense of closure, a ceremonial explanation. He proposed, not got married. I don&#39;t think they got married. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a big difference between proposing and getting married. Proposing means my determination and intention. I want to be with you forever. I didn’t say we’d grow old together, but I wanted to build our own world with you. I know that we may encounter many difficulties after entering marriage, but I believe that you and I have the ability to live our lives the way we want. This is the determination I want to say. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Idealism and materialism are not contradictory. I thought so in my heart. I want to take some actions to prove it. When I have the financial resources, I will buy a diamond ring to express my love to my lover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I put such a scene in the ending just to tell the audience that Xu Ziquan is a sincere person. Many viewers thought he was handsome, his butt was perky, he owned a car and a house, and he was a financial man... so they concluded that this (proposal) was not true, that this love was a fairy tale, and that he could not like a third-year lawyer so much. ——It looks like that. But love is not a business. There is no reason to fall in love with someone. I just love you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time of the final proposal, Xu Ziquan&#39;s view of love had changed. He was willing to build &quot;our world&quot; with Tang Ying, and was willing to turn one person&#39;s life into &quot;our two lives.&quot; , I think this is the value and meaning of marriage proposal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am willing to advocate the positive expression of I love you and my willingness in my plays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is this also your view on love? This positive expression and belief? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I keep exploring what love is before I can believe in it. I believe love begins when I meet my wife. A large part of Xu Ziquan is my projection. He didn&#39;t think there was such a person in the world who could support me, who could see the worst in me and still love me, who could tolerate me and understand me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tang Ying is the one who talks about love and understands love. Xu Ziquan understands teasing and skills. He knows how to make people like him. I like the scene in the bathroom the most. When Xu Ziquan was very bad, Tang Ying did not criticize him for being bad, but told him: You should tell me that you are not in a good state, you should share with me, and you should tell him that you are not in good condition. Show me your good side, don&#39;t worry, I can catch it, I think you are the best, you don&#39;t even know how good you are. This is a moment that I have experienced in my life, which makes me feel that I am loved, wrapped and supported by others. She made me feel that even though I was in such a bad state, I had such mood swings, my career was at a low point, and I couldn&#39;t see the future, she still didn&#39;t despise me, didn&#39;t measure me based on these, and didn&#39;t condemn me. She told me: I love you, you don’t even know how good you are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That moment made me understand what love is. It turns out that love is not about asking or giving, but about giving to each other. It means being able to see the worst side of him and still love him. This is the concept of love I want to tell you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/RUmrzlT0NgeYRX9rp0B9x0P0HAmubDRtmCGSdJwj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/RUmrzlT0NgeYRX9rp0B9x0P0HAmubDRtmCGSdJwj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills of &quot;The Pretender Apocalypse&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;No results will come if you don’t work hard None&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said you like Han Dongjun (playing Xu Zi Quan), why does this feeling of fatigue touch you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the people in the circle I want to talk about are not worthy of saying they are tired or saying they have worked hard. They earn more money. In the context of the play, it is unacceptable for people who earn more money to suffer miserably.

What else are you miserable about? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The worst thing about them is that they are not qualified to say they are miserable. There are seniors and juniors above them, and there are competitors beside them. If they make a mistake, they will be overthrown by others. No one can see the current situation of their lives. People think you deserve it, you deserve it. Why do you scream miserably? I can&#39;t even eat, I don&#39;t even scream miserably. You live in fine clothes and food every day, and go to luxurious occasions. Why are you so miserable? So I can&#39;t scream for them in this scene. I can only show their state. This is the feeling of fatigue. He can&#39;t express it. He can only smile and say to people, yes, you are right. This is how I feel about the people I know. Of course I don&#39;t think they are miserable either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I want to talk about this group of people, I have to capture the most unique part of this group of people. For me, this part is that these people are very tired, but they can’t express it. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You filmed &quot;I&#39;m Good in a Foreign Country&quot; and &quot;Three &quot;Joy Has a New Life&quot; and &quot;Pretending to Be Apocalypse&quot; have received good reviews. What do you hope to express? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;They are all about urban life, and they are all about the plight of urban young people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been in trouble before, and maybe I am in trouble now. Difficulties will help people grow and hone themselves better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Which dilemmas in the drama are you most sympathetic to? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s the feeling of powerlessness at work. I clearly know that this thing can be done well, and I know how to do it well, but I just can&#39;t do it. At times like this, I feel very small in this city. I don’t know what the problem is, I’ve done everything I can, but things are still like this. This is the plight of urbanites that resonates most with me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I want to tell you more, don’t give up in the face of this dilemma. Giving up is a kind of self-protection, because if you don’t have expectations, you won’t be disappointed or hurt. Whether facing work, love or family relationships, they all protect themselves in a way of withdrawal. It&#39;s fine if I&#39;m alone, it&#39;s fine if I don&#39;t go up, it&#39;s fine if I lie down, and I still get paid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even so, we should try. How terrible is failure? How terrible is falling out of love? Sometimes I feel that falling out of love is a very happy thing. I can feel many emotions that I can&#39;t usually feel. What a valuable life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You see, everything I talked about is quite idealistic. The material aspect is also important, but in fact you can live no matter what, and you don’t have to make a lot of money. The main thing is to figure out the standard of living you want, and if you do well in what you do today, it will be great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you feel like you have gotten out of this predicament now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s hard to get out. I still feel powerless. Even if I feel I have done more than before, I still have things to do. Less than. The longer I work, the more powerless I feel. There are very few things that people can control. The director seems to have quite a lot of power and can decide many things, but I can&#39;t decide whether it will rain today or whether there will be a meeting tomorrow. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you feel powerless, it means you have not found the right way to get along with the world. Once you find it, you can feel the support the world gives you, rather than you and the world. opposition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When did you begin to feel that the world was giving you help and support? Not resistance? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I am not fighting with the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The powerlessness brought about by the current social structure The feeling may not be resolved. The reality is that our efforts may not necessarily bring positive returns, and individuals cannot achieve a change in their destiny just by working hard. Have you ever thought about this reality in your expression? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I plan to talk to you about this in a later project. It is about a young man born in the 2000s who has been very ambitious since he was a child. , was admitted to a very good university in Beijing, and enrolled in 2019. After three years of the COVID-19 epidemic, I couldn’t find a job after graduation. I am currently writing a script and will film this project next year. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think now is an era of change, which is different from before. Everyone must accept the change. Every generation will face changes in the times, such as social fluctuations, wars, and changes, so there is no need to panic. You said that in the face of structural problems, people need to adjust their goals and self-positioning in the face of this era. It does not mean that the times have changed and I will not get the same results as in the previous era if I work hard, so I don&#39;t work hard. Efforts in this era will have results in this era. Without efforts, there will be no results. Working hard is not a choice, working hard is what you should do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe when I finish filming the scene next year, I can bring some discussion to everyone. I want to tell everyone how to be down-to-earth in that scene. But I still want to tell you here, don’t give up. When you are lying down in this era, a group of people who are not lying down will take away the opportunity. This is the case in every era. The opportunities you give up will be taken away by others. If you work hard, you may find opportunities. Facing life positively is not a bad thing in any era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[历经社会毒打为何屹立不倒？因为“男人至死是少年” ]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256898]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 22:00:36&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;A man is a boy until he dies&quot; is so widely known that my eardrums sometimes Be shaken. For example, most men retain the hobbies of their youth, such as games, toys, sports, and crafts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, &quot;A man remains a boy until he dies&quot; is a comment full of life philosophy. It is simply &quot;measured&quot; by a group of men who have experienced the cruel beatings of society but can always stand up in the world. &quot;Customized&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A foreign talk show actor said in an interview that eating pizza and drinking wine, sitting in front of the TV watching football games, scolding the referee, just spending a happy time alone, never mind What a blessing. When asked if he was tired from watching so many football games in a week, he replied: &quot;Not tired at all, because I am the kind of simple-minded man who can get happiness just by sitting and watching football games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;So, &quot;Will you watch football games with your wife?&quot; His answer was: &quot;No, she has a complicated mind and it is difficult to focus on one thing. Some women feel unhappy every day because of this.&quot; A bit. He complained about his wife. However, one fact is good: differences in preferences between men and women exist objectively, and many times, this difference is also interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A male respondent on Zhihu said that there were a bunch of things in his online shopping list that he wanted to buy but knew were useless, and a wooden stick costing more than ten yuan came second. After getting the stick, he put glue on his hands and brought it to the unit. The female colleague asked him why he bought it. He said he just wanted to buy it, but she didn&#39;t understand. This seems to mean that a dozen yuan is money, and it is not a waste to buy a handful of green onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asserted: &quot;I&#39;ll just put the stick here. Do you think any man will come over and not play with it?&quot; As a result, six or seven people played with the stick in the afternoon. She couldn&#39;t understand it, so he gave it to her. Her husband sent a photo, and after a while her husband replied: This stick is great! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The respondent lamented that this stick can kill boys from a few years old to several decades old, but as long as a boy sees something he played with when he was a child, he will immediately and seamlessly pick it up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also have personal experience of this. I played seal carving when I was thirteen and learned a lot. Although I slacked off a bit when I reached middle age, my hobby of sharpening stones remained. As long as you see the carving knife and the seal stone, you will feel warm in your heart. If you pick up the stone and sharpen it, you will experience the non-utilitarian joy. Not long ago, my parents-in-law listened to my suggestion and built a &quot;grindstone&quot; for me in a chicken coop in the countryside. I often put away my mundane things and concentrate on grinding stones here. While grinding the stone, the chickens are walking and the insects are chirping, and the wind is blowing and the leaves are falling, so I feel at ease. At that moment, this ultimate tranquility with nothing to worry about and no rush for five buckets of rice was charming and magical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final analysis, the reason why many men can remain teenagers until they die is that they have always experienced the essence of simple happiness. Not to mention that things worth more than ten yuan can make them happy. Even worthless things, such as a branch or a stone picked up from the Gobi Desert, can make them immersed in it and play with it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the real happiness does not cost money. A good friend who graduated from Peking University told me that he likes physics and mathematics and is very happy every time he looks at it online. One of my old leaders also likes to sit for a while at work after work late at night and play against Go masters on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have noticed the chess players and chess watchers in a small street called Hongmiao near my work. Unless it rains heavily, they all play and watch chess on old tables on the street. As the chess game changes, , sometimes they are nervous and &quot;dare not speak loudly&quot;, sometimes they are cheerful and cheerful. I have been here for more than ten years, so I have carefully noticed that there are always only a few people playing chess and watching chess. Over the years, apart from their older faces, their happy expressions have not changed at all. Is that chess game about money? About reputation? About status? Not really. They are just &quot;stealing half a day&#39;s leisure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writer Wang Zengqi also wrote a story about an old man who was selfless and wonderful at making noodles and fish, praising him as a &quot;living Zhuangzi&quot;. The essence of the so-called &quot;living Zhuangzi&quot; is not &quot;profound&quot;, but the far-reaching and unrestrained imagery. The same goes for those &quot;fishing friends&quot; who sit by the quiet and deserted river all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the vast majority of men cannot remain isolated from the world, and they are burdened by fame and fortune. But after entering middle-aged and old age, many men suddenly realize that since their jobs and ranks are just like that, the heights they can reach in their lifetime are also like that. Let go of what you can’t get, leaving a pure world for yourself to live a better life. Simple and more innocent, wouldn&#39;t it be better? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of consideration is a reflection of simple character. When a man has thought through his personal honor and disgrace, as well as the gains and losses in life, the rest will become much simpler. Therefore, getting pleasure from getting along with yourself has become a daily task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting along with oneself is, in a sense, the most difficult thing. If a person always has unrealistic goals and is always competing with himself, then the quality of his life will be very bad and his personality will be easily torn. Of course, if a person always has unrealistic goals (for his spouse) out of a desire to compare, and urges his spouse to &quot;work hard&quot; to make more money and have power, then the quality of this kind of relationship will be It will be terrible and it will be difficult for the family to get along. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, if a person can realize that at a certain stage of life, he is not pursuing what is happiness, and can maintain a normal mind, it will be easy for his own &quot;shadow&quot; to be created by himself. Infected by the natural interest, they can truly integrate together and make themselves stronger and more calm. If family members are more understanding or are such people, the family will be more harmonious and harmonious. This kind of freedom, relaxation, selflessness, and enjoyment are very different from the comparison fueled by consumerism that can easily lead to pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People are inevitably disturbed by desires, but people still have to work hard to achieve a balanced relationship with themselves. Childlike innocence is still a very common but supreme state. Its basis is a strong disposition, the true meaning of happiness. In the final analysis, many men&#39;s respect for &quot;simple happiness&quot; represents a group&#39;s objective evaluation of their own value and a neither humble nor arrogant attitude towards &quot;the outside world&quot;. It continues the childlike innocence of individuals and makes secular life a little more tranquil. of interest. This is the secret of a man hidden in &quot;Till he is a boy until his death.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[刺客模式丨意长意短]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256930]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/IoH3LnypZUwNhU91O62T9wKXgOBVpGdB4mr6Axlw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/IoH3LnypZUwNhU91O62T9 wKXgOBVpGdB4mr6Axlw. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251102&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Saint-Lazare Metro Regional Express (RER) station in Paris, France. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When living in the countryside, there is no time to rush to get angry, it is just to rush out to collect when it rains heavily. clothes, or close windows that let in water. But going into the city is different, especially since there are so many anxious moments in Paris, such as catching a car or a flight. At that moment, I usually turn on the &quot;Assassin Mode&quot; and constantly remind myself: Concentrate and go straight to the goal, so as not to delay things. For example, one morning, I made an appointment with a friend from China who was visiting an art museum, and we had breakfast together in her hotel. I went out and found that it was already a little late. I was going to take bus 72 to the Louvre Museum. I saw bus 72 passing in front of me. It was still 500 meters away from the next stop. While the car was waiting at the traffic light, I ran forward in one breath, hoping to catch up before the car reached the next stop. I ran about a hundred meters when the bus driver caught up with me and honked the horn for me to get on the bus. After I got on, everyone in the car looked at me with sympathy. They must be thinking, this woman is really a bit hard-working. I was a little confused for a moment, thanked the master, and swiped my card in a hurry. In fact, I didn’t expect that the harder work would come later. When I took the plane back to China, I realized that every second counts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I first planned to go by car, and everything was arranged in an orderly manner. My friend Mike is an Italian petty bourgeoisie living in Paris (Li Piao is keen on shopping in supermarkets, saving points, and discovering various money-saving strategies). He has never taken me to the airport because he used to drive a diesel car with pollution level 5, which could not be driven except on weekends. Now that he has a new car with pollution level 2, which is ready to go on the road at any time, he enthusiastically said that he would give it to me. And the timing was coincidental, he got off work at five o&#39;clock and we set off at five twenty. My flight is at 9:20, so I leave four hours early. Charles de Gaulle Airport is only 30 kilometers away from where I live, so I should be there in an hour. I thought about it and thought it was appropriate. At five o&#39;clock, I went to a nearby shop and bought a bowl of fish fillet rice bowl. It was topped with a layer of tuna and salmon. It was not soupy and watery. It could be enjoyed before boarding the plane, so there was no need to eat on the plane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We set off at almost half past five. The atmosphere was relaxed, listening to music, talking and laughing. The first few kilometers were pretty smooth. Once on the ring road, the road was basically like a parking lot. Only motorcycles were speeding in the gaps between cars. Ambulances and police cars passed one by one, and the cars on both sides gave way. I looked out the window and thought about what&#39;s so good about a big city. It&#39;s so chaotic. But I really had plenty of time, so I tried to relax. The radio in the car played the soothing, melancholy and melodious singing of jazz singer Bilie Holiday, which was like a massage for the soul. It was about a woman. Crazy for love, you can move mountains and so on for love. Mike said it would be nice if you were a homeless person living under a bridge and didn&#39;t have to rush back to work. I want that too, but I like soft beds, I love my job, and I have to rush back to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We were stuck in traffic on the ring road for an hour and planned to get off, but when we got to the side road, the car stopped there, unable to move forward or backward. On the map, the entire city&#39;s routes were red, and I waited until almost seven o&#39;clock. I looked out the window, and there were cars all around me. I became more and more panicked. I began to imagine the tragic situation of being expelled from school because I couldn&#39;t catch up with class. Even the brisk jazz tunes couldn&#39;t calm my mood. The city outside the window seemed like It&#39;s getting more and more aggressive, and the blue sky and white clouds seem hollow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mike was at a loss, so he took out a ticket from his wallet and said to me: &quot;You get off here and go straight to Line 4. From there you take the bus to North Station and then take the RER express.&quot; , Line B to Charles de Gaulle, it takes an hour to get to the airport. This area is very chaotic, be careful with your wallet and mobile phone. Are you ready?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was not ready, but I got off the bus bravely , if there were any mistakes in the middle and I couldn&#39;t make it within an hour, I would have missed my flight. But if I sit in the car and wait, I will definitely miss my flight. I grabbed my luggage from the trunk (I was glad I had four wheels) and sped down the bike path like an antelope being chased by a lion on the grassland. I turned on &quot;assassin mode&quot; while running, with the goal of getting to the airport within an hour. I am glad that I wear sneakers and have good physical strength like a retired athlete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The beginning went well. I was standing in the subway station, hesitating where to get off. An old lady said loudly: &quot;It&#39;s the same on both sides.&quot; As soon as I got underground, there was a subway waiting with its door open. Before going up, I confirmed with a gentle man whether I was going to the North Station. I looked at the stop sign carefully, worried that I would miss it. But when I got to the North Railway Station, things became complicated. There were many trains, RER lines and subway lines. I couldn&#39;t find the B line at once. I followed the signs but ended up in the wrong place. Fortunately, I asked before getting on the train. You didn&#39;t get on the wrong bus. I was walking around like a headless fly when I saw an officer on duty who was on the phone. I rushed over and asked him where to sit at Charles de Gaulle Airport. He must have been shocked by the fact that I was sweating profusely. While he was talking on the phone, he quickly led me to the car. Coincidentally, the car I was going to take arrived at this time, so I might have a better chance of catching the plane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then there were forty anxious minutes. Each stop seemed extremely long, and people got on and off the bus leisurely at each stop. I thought that only flash floods, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and subway failures could prevent me from going to the airport at this time. I was very anxious and kept looking at my phone and looking at the two women sitting next to me who looked calm. They also had huge luggage, but they must have more time. I sighed that I was still sitting on a deck chair by the river yesterday afternoon, eating raw ham and cheese, drinking beer, and today I was about to go through such a test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport, twenty minutes before it closed for boarding passes. I followed the crowd and rushed to the counter. A handsome black man opened his hand and said to me: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll make it in time. Just relax.&quot; I handed him my passport, thinking that I must look very good. It&#39;s so embarrassing, it&#39;s like a bandit crossing the border. The passengers next to me were also complaining about the heavy traffic jam today, seeming to explain my late arrival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I sent my luggage, queued at the security check, and sent a voice message to my Italian friend about what happened today. The girl in front of me turned out to be Italian, so she said to me: &quot;You should be in front of me. If it were me, I would be extremely anxious.&quot; We are truly sisters from all over the world. She said that she had worked at L&#39;Oréal Paris for three years and was now going to Shanghai to stay for three years. Her plane was behind me. I thanked her and moved in front of her without any ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I arrived at the boarding gate, I found that the sweat on my body had turned cold, my T-shirt was completely soaked, and the yellow fish pattern printed on it had turned brown. I suddenly felt very worried. I saw a retail store next to me, so I spent twenty euros on a souvenir T-shirt for my trip. I went to the bathroom to put it on and dried my hair to make sure everything was safe. At this time, there is no longer any queue at the boarding gate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m in line to board the plane.&quot; I called Mike to reassure him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I just came home too.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Thank you for the airport light rail ticket today, thank you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You&#39;re welcome, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t You delivered it. I&#39;m eating the fish fillet rice bowl you forgot on the seat. It&#39;s not bad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I wish you a good appetite.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I wish you a safe journey. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, I walked out of Chongqing Airport wearing a slightly tacky T-shirt with a huge Eiffel Tower printed on the chest, like a tourist who had just checked in. I have to say that catching the plane this time has given me a lot of confidence to face the future while feeling lucky. I remembered a scripture: There is a time for everything, a time for everything under the heaven...A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to abandon; a time to tear, and a time to mend; a time to be silent, and a time to speak...I feel that everything is There is a certainty that sometimes you miss your flight and sometimes you catch up: when necessary, turn on the &quot;assassin mode&quot;, stay vigilant&lt;strong>;and&lt;/strong>; move forward bravely, and there is always a chance of catching up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:12 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[导游变身导买，这样的旅游团还能走多远？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256920]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, I signed up for two tour groups, namely Three Gorges and Wulong. The orders were placed on the same travel platform. The customer service is very patient, the procedures are very standardized, and electronic contracts, travel notices, insurance purchases, etc. are all available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenery on both sides of the Three Gorges is beautiful. On the cruise ship, you can watch the rising sun in the morning and the bright moon and stars in the evening. You can hold a sleeve of breeze and watch the river flowing eastward. It is really a good place to express your love for the mountains and rivers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gap between the Tiankeng and the ground in Wulong is even more amazing. The Tiankeng is really as if God accidentally dropped a huge boulder, creating a huge crater on the ground. It is majestic, strange, dangerous and... It&#39;s quiet; the crack in the ground is like a narrow crack in the depths of the earth. The rock walls on both sides are steep, with springs and waterfalls splashing above, and streams flowing below. It&#39;s endlessly ethereal and breathtaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the beauty of these two journeys only ends here, because traveling also requires eating, sleeping, and a tour guide, which does not feel so wonderful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the tour guide first. Tour guides have long implemented the local accompanying system. They change tour guides at each place. When they arrive at the scenic spot, they change to another commentator. Along the way, there are many tour guides. One face is not familiar yet, and another face is changed immediately. It’s a revolving door. Similar. This is very unfriendly to me who is face blind, but that&#39;s it - there&#39;s nothing I can do about it - after not traveling far for three years, I was surprised to find that the guide system has always been the same, but now the tour guide&#39;s style has changed again , have turned into guides and bought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After we swam at the Three Gorges Dam, on the way to the dock, the tour guide started selling beef, small fish products and sesame food in the car. She said that the quality of these products was guaranteed and the prices were reasonable. She wanted to buy them. Earn money for interest classes for my daughter. The driver cooperated and drove slowly, and then simply stopped on the side of the road. About one-third of the tourists bought the products she put in the car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the middle of the trip to the Three Gorges, we got on a small boat and traveled to Shennu Creek. In addition to the boatman, there is also a tour guide named Amei on the boat. Shennu Creek is very beautiful, and the guide’s introduction was pretty good at the beginning. However, after only being “good” for a while, she introduced her hometown and various specialties from her hometown, which are “purely natural, pollution-free, and have special effects on the human body.” Efficacy&quot;. As I expected, on the return trip, she started selling the local specialties that had been placed on the cruise ship. During the entire return journey, I heard the tour guide shouting in the headset: &quot;Please support our hometown.&quot; &quot;How many packs do you want?&quot; The mood of watching the scenery was ruined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After arriving in Chongqing, the tour guide did not help me buy any real items. What she sold was a night tour in Chongqing, three places, 70 yuan. When the car arrived in the city, she got off the bus with the tourists participating in the night tour and asked us to go to the hotel to check in. Then the tourists got into a quarrel at the hotel front desk over who checked in first and who last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wulong Tour also took us to a Miao Village Scenic Spot. In this scenic spot, the most impressive thing was that the tour guide of the scenic spot constantly promoted their silver products. In his mouth, these silver products are unparalleled in the world. The only thing left is that it has a full range of health care effects, blah blah blah. As a result, no one bought it, so he ignored us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about food. Most of the two tour groups include meals. Except for the three meals on the cruise ship, which are normal, the rest is hard to describe. The meal price is 40 yuan per person, eight dishes and one soup. These eight dishes include meaty ones such as very fatty pork belly, stir-fried chicken offal with onions, etc., and vegetarian ones such as cold skin, potatoes, pumpkins, etc. The soup is a veritable soup. I only saw three pieces of radish in one radish soup... &lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;As for the accommodation, each person is only guaranteed to have a bed to sleep on. As for whether the lights are on, whether the bath water is at a suitable temperature, and whether the door lock is broken, tourists are left to their own devices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When traveling, you don’t make a guide, don’t plan a route, don’t bother to think about the car, meals, hotel, etc., but leave it all to the travel agency and become a hands-off shopkeeper yourself. I think it’s very strange. Economical and convenient model. Your travel agency makes money, and I, the tourist, enjoy the beautiful mountains, rivers and good mood. Both parties get what they want, how wonderful! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what I wonder is, why is the tourism industry running in the opposite direction? You see, the tour guide will almost reach into your pocket and take out the money. The group meal costing 400 yuan per table can be reduced to 40 yuan. The cheaper the room, the better, no matter what facilities it has. Don’t they think they are seeking a dead end and pushing tourists away? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years after the epidemic, the market demand for tourism is huge. If the tourism industry seizes this trend, rectifies its business practices, provides high-quality services, changes its image, and builds reputation, it should be able to attract many tourists. under their command. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What a pity, they are going further and further on the road of deceiving tourists. I don’t know how far this kind of tour group can go.

The reporter learned from the China Bicycle Association on the 17th that my country, as the world&#39;s largest bicycle manufacturer and exporter, currently has more than 200 million bicycles in society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Wenyu, vice chairman and secretary-general of the China Cycling Association, said that based on a survey of travel data in eight cities including Beijing, Changsha, and Chengdu, about 30 out of every 100 trips taken by urban residents across the country are made by bicycles. &quot;Two-wheel travel&quot; has been completed, and &quot;two-wheel travel&quot; occurring around rail stations across the country accounts for more than 20% of the total travel volume. &quot;Two-wheel travel&quot; reduces carbon emissions by about 10,000 tons across the country every day. Based on a fuel consumption of 8 liters per 100 kilometers, this is equivalent to saving about 6.6 million liters of gasoline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bicycle industry continues to promote product structure optimization. Guo Wenyu said that the current output of lightweight and intelligent electric-assisted bicycles has increased significantly. In the past two years, the domestic sales growth rate of electric-assisted bicycles has exceeded 20%, and electric-assisted bicycles with intelligent functions are favored by young consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bicycle industry continues to advance digitally and intelligently. Guo Wenyu said that currently on the production side, welding robots, painting robots, assembly line feeding robots, etc. have a wider range of applications, and more than 20% of industry companies have carried out production line automation upgrades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the consumer side of the bicycle industry, relying on technical support such as big data and the Internet of Things, new products and new models such as shared bicycles and centralized charging and swapping have emerged. Chu Yiqun, vice president of Haro Group, said that as a leading company in shared travel, Haro&#39;s number of registered users and orders have increased steadily in the past few years. &quot;Using high-level cycling products and services to continue to popularize low-carbon travel and healthy living, shared bicycle companies have a duty-free responsibility.&quot; Chu Yiqun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[学者谈县域教育：要给没有能力进城的学生一定的教育发展空间]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256753]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/15/b7Le3Gk6KsMQUogjkOpyho34RgSaUA8lBPeNQWX2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/b7Le3Gk6KsMQUogjkOpyho34RgSaUA8lBP eNQWX2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250887&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 2, 2021, in a rural primary school in Tengchong, Baoshan, Yunnan, preparations Sleeping students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2017, Lei Wanghong, who was still studying for a doctorate in administration at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, was working on Looking for a topic for her doctoral thesis, she set her sights on grassroots education for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This decision came from a &quot;shock&quot;. She graduated from a rural school in Jianghan Plain and studied all the way to get a doctorate. However, when she returned to her hometown, she heard that the school was no longer what it used to be. Students were fighting and the enrollment rate was declining. The junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and wiped in the back of the classroom. tears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Lei Wanghong visited county schools in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Gansu, Henan and other regions, and she found that this phenomenon was not a special case. She noticed that some drastic changes were taking place at the end of basic education, and these changes at the end were silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the wave of urbanization in education, rural students are pouring into counties, and what is left in villages and towns are often children who cannot afford to go to cities to study. Some of them do not like to study, are disobedient to discipline, and are almost self-indulgent. Giving up, the teacher also has a headache, and both parties are in confusion with no way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lei Wanghong believes that for county-level governments, the main goal of education urbanization is regional development, that is, by attracting rural students to study in cities and driving rural people to buy houses and consume in cities, thereby promoting land The closed fiscal cycle ultimately promotes regional economic development. However, from a practical point of view, the introduction of education into cities has not greatly stimulated local economic development as expected, but has resulted in some students being left behind in villages and towns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She found that counties in central and western provinces and eastern provinces have different development paths in the process of promoting urbanization of education: public and private education are more balanced in the eastern region, while private education in the central and western regions is relatively stronger. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there such regional differences? Educational urbanization has experienced at least ten years of development. How effective is it? Under this wave, what should the remaining children do? Lei Wanghong is now a lecturer at the School of Public Administration of Central South University. She was interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters on related issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The economic foundation determines the development path of county education&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you pay attention to county education issues at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>; Once when I returned to my hometown, a neighbor kid told me that my junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and was wiping tears behind the classroom. When I was studying, she was very majestic, and I respected her very much. This contrast was shocking. In addition, the situation in my hometown has not been very good for higher education in recent years, and there has been a fierce discussion in society about the uneven distribution of educational resources. At that time, our team had been studying grassroots governance, and no one had studied grassroots education issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After May 2017, I went to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi and Guizhou and other places to investigate different villages, townships and counties. The education situation of various school stages in the space, and understanding the development of government education, students&#39; family situations, and school social evaluation, the overall research perspective of county education gradually emerged. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Eastern and central and western regions, in county education What problems do each face during development? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The eastern region has sufficient educational resources and capable parents. They generally form better home-school cooperation with schools, but competition in education It is very fierce. For example, the Hangzhou Family Committee election was reported in the news before. In order to give their children more performance opportunities, parents will engage in fierce PK. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important problem in the central and western regions is intergenerational separation. Parents will also follow the trend and adopt some self-help behaviors, such as &quot;accompanying students&quot;. The phenomenon of accompanying students in Gansu, Shaanxi, Anhui, and Hubei is very universal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you found any similarities in the education situation in different regions? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One similarity is the urbanization of education. To put it simply, the improvement of the quality of schools in the city will attract students to study in the city, which in turn will encourage more families to buy houses in the city, thereby revitalizing land finance and regional development. But there are some differences between the eastern region and the central and western regions. The former&#39;s education urbanization is more of a natural urbanization. Parents move to cities to work, live and take their children to receive education because there are job opportunities in the city. The latter&#39;s education urbanization is driven by local governments, because rural areas The supply of school education is too poor, and local governments have invested more resources in urban schools, thus forcing people to send their children to urban schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, I went to a developed county in Zhejiang for research. Basically, all the local village primary schools were withdrawn and concentrated on running schools in towns and villages. Township schools are well-equipped and beautifully built, and their teachers are of high standard, many of whom are admitted from other places. However, due to the urbanization of education, rural children have gone to cities to study, and those who are left behind are children with poor family conditions who do not like to study and are not easy to manage, which is a headache for teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I found that this phenomenon is very common. The end of the eastern region is at the township level, and the end of the central and western regions is at the village level. Being at such an end, unable to provide students with enough educational hope, teachers are also in pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The development logic of education urbanization in the eastern and central and western regions is the same ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Due to different economic bases, the eastern region and the central and western regions have very different spatial distribution. The eastern region has a developed economy and strong education supply capacity, and the quality of public education in various urban and rural areas of the county can be guaranteed. The eastern region has developed industries and large employment opportunities. Parents go to the cities to find jobs, and their children also go to the cities to study. Families can buy houses and live in the cities. Its urbanization is a natural urbanization in which education and production are synchronized. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large number of counties in the central and western regions have not yet established local finances that allow local governments to obtain sufficient financial resources. They are unable to ensure the balanced development of urban and rural education and provide employment for local migrant workers returning home. There is also very little space. Young people from peasant families can only go to the eastern cities to work and earn money. Because they cannot afford the high cost of education in developed areas, the children can only stay in their hometowns to go to school and be taken care of by their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1706&quot; height= &quot;1278&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250888&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 2023, Lei Wanghong and his team conducted research in a certain county. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Public education needs to respond to social needs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since at least ten years ago, there have been many views that urbanization of education is a &quot;green engine&quot;. You What is the entry point for research on educational urbanization? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, I was mainly stimulated by two things. First, many people in the academic community regard urbanization of education as a positive behavior. However, during the actual research process, I found that there are many problems in urbanization of education. Everyone’s educational anxiety is very serious, and many families bear an excessive educational burden. Education, medical care, and housing have become the new &quot;three mountains.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other thing is that I was deeply inspired after reading the doctoral thesis &quot;Children of Urbanization&quot; by Professor Xiong Yihan of Fudan University. The phenomenon we are concerned about is very similar - can rural children share the blue sky of education with urban children after entering the city? In fact, rural children are easily marginalized when they move to cities. For example, teachers in the city will mention that rural children have stereotypes such as being unhygienic and unruly. The campus culture of urban schools will make rural children feel inferior to a certain extent; rural children rarely have access to class power. structure, because teachers are more likely to accept children who are influenced by urban culture and form effective communication and interaction with them. When I held discussions with urban and rural students, I also found that urban students have stronger expressive skills and are good at showing themselves, while rural students are introverted. When they want to speak, they will inadvertently look at urban students for fear of saying something wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To promote the urbanization of education, local governments must build new schools in counties and open Between public and private schools, which option do most counties prefer? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The government is more willing to build public schools. Because private schools have difficulties in management, they can charge fees independently, use enrollment policies flexibly, and attract high-quality students through benefits. After the results of the high school and high school entrance exams are released, these students become the &quot;living signs&quot; of the school&#39;s publicity. Teachers will further gather in private schools, putting local public schools in a weak position and affecting the local education ecology to a certain extent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But in fact, the central and western regions will still choose to introduce it Private school, why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because the local finances of some counties in the central and western regions are not enough to support the development of public education. On the one hand, the local government has the task of attracting investment, and on the other hand, it has to ensure the supply of education and is under multiple pressures. Private schools in some areas are introduced through investment promotion. The local government has not only completed the corresponding investment quotas, but also alleviated the pressure on local degree supply. At the same time, the outstanding students cultivated by private schools can also be counted as the educational achievements of local governments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why do parents prefer private schools? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The main reason is that many public schools have not responded to parents’ educational demands. This year I went to a township junior high school in a central province for research and found that the student cafeteria was not equipped with tables and chairs, and students squatted at the top of the stairs to eat. Some schools arrange for students to live in houses that were built 20 or 30 years ago, and the walls of the dormitories fall off from time to time. In 2021, I met a driver during my research. He said that both of his children were studying in private schools, which cost 60,000 yuan a year. The couple&#39;s salary was only enough to cover the expenses of the children, and their life was very stressful. I asked him if he would be willing to go to a public school if it could provide relatively good room and board services, but it would cost an extra thousand yuan per semester. He said he would definitely do it. This is also the sentiment of most parents. Only when the government finds a way to truly respond to the demands of the people will students slowly return to private schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/eXR0y4KyX2vVuA7IczOqzh7qbbrpC1EV7FohbnJB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/eXR0y4KyX2vVuA7IczOqzh7qbbrpC1EV7FohbnJB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250889&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 11, 2020, a newly built primary school was put into operation in Suining County, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Respect the laws of natural flow&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After research, what problems have you found that urbanization in education may bring about? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first is debt risk. Some local governments use education as the starting point to promote education to revitalize the city and invest a large amount of money in a short period of time. New schools were built, leading to serious debt. Recently I heard that a county in a central province is spending huge sums of money to build a school. Many counties in the survey have huge debts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the maintenance cost of schools is very high. Some local governments build schools to the highest standards ahead of schedule, leaving a large amount of space idle, resulting in very high school operating costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, farmers have a heavy education burden. When building primary and secondary schools in some places, they only focus on pure education issues and do not consider the overall social division of labor. Some newly built schools in urban areas are not equipped with dormitories and canteens. Rural parents who send their children to the city still need to rent or buy a house in the city to accompany them to school. They cannot Parents who take care of their children leave their children to child care institutions. For example, the child care institutions in Guangxi are particularly developed now. The child care institutions not only take care of students&#39; lives, but also take care of after-school learning. Whether it is renting or buying a house to accompany students to study, or hosting, it has greatly increased the financial burden of education on farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is the adaptation problem of rural students just mentioned. A new dual structure of urban and rural education has essentially been formed in urban schools. The family background and family knowledge ability of rural students may not necessarily support them in the city. receive a fair education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since there are so many problems, why are the grassroots in the central and western provinces still there? Promote education urbanization? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In addition to facilitating management, the county government is also trying to activate local land finance through education urbanization. By vigorously developing education in county towns, farmers can move to cities to buy houses. Local governments can promote the return of capital, population agglomeration, and the formation of a chain to activate the county economy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are these efforts effective? I saw that in the three central and western counties you visited for your doctoral thesis, housing prices did not rise in the end. Why is this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, farmers are not very motivated to buy houses in cities. In 2014, the house price in a county in Gansu was 4,000 yuan/square meter. But when I went to the county for research in 2017, house prices were still hovering around 4,000 yuan. Even so, the house still couldn&#39;t be sold. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to the development of county education lies in the county economy. The fundamental reason why farmers are not enthusiastic about buying houses in cities is that the cities lack an industrial foundation that can support them to maintain their family life. If migrant workers can only work as construction workers, waiters, etc. in the county, their income level is not enough to support them to buy a house and settle down in the county. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is educational urbanization a local development path worthy of recognition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The urbanization of education is an inevitable trend, but there are differences in speed. What we are criticizing is the phenomenon of using education as the starting point to promote urban development through education. Educational urbanization must be promoted at a reasonable speed. On the one hand, the natural flow laws must be respected. People who have the ability to go to the city and want to go to the city must respect their choices. At the same time, we must also see the impact of human factors promoting education urbanization. Problems such as incoming debt, high maintenance costs, and difficulty for students to adapt. At the current stage, a more appropriate way is to build good township schools and give students who cannot afford to go to the city a certain space for educational development. Children who study in this space can hope to enter high school and college, which will improve the mobility of the entire social class. Only by maintaining smooth flow can there be hope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Huang Xiaoying also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打破出身论？上海民办高校毕业生可报考选调生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256922]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/lF7PAVJ2SvAM8WPULb51S2fKME0OfGlO9eMe4ayu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1123&quot; height=&quot;748&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/lF7PAVJ2SvAM8WPULb51S2fKME0OfGlO9 eMe4ayu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251072&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 20, 2022, Wuhan, candidates took the 2022 Hubei Provincial Selection Examination . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Graduates from private colleges and universities who were once exclusively admitted to prestigious public schools can also apply.

Among them, Shanghai Lida College was the latest to upgrade and did not start recruiting undergraduates until 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting graduates from private colleges and universities did not start in 2023. Southern Weekend reporters found that this policy has been implemented as early as 2021. Previously, Shanghai only recruited graduates from 15 universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Renmin University of China, of which nine were from the city&#39;s 985 and 211 universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from 2021, Shanghai will relax restrictions on universities and include 30 local universities on the list, including the aforementioned 7 private universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an important way to supplement grassroots party and government leading cadres, the selection and transfer system has been to select the best from the best since its inception. In 1965, the Ministry of Education assigned some college graduates to work in rural areas, and the selective transfer system began. In the late 1970s, this system was gradually implemented in various provinces, and the selection targets were mainly undergraduate graduates with strong party spirit and excellent academic performance in universities. In order to solve the problem of the lack of highly educated talents among grassroots cadres, in 2009, Chongqing launched the first targeted selection system for Qingbei and other 985 universities, kicking off the targeted selection to famous universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that the current targeted recruitment announcements issued by some provinces also specifically indicate that the recruitment scope does not include independent colleges and private universities. However, some provinces have expanded the scope of selective transfer to private schools. From a national perspective, graduates from some private universities in Fujian and Hunan can also apply for selective transfer. Fujian once adopted the method of quota allocation, allocating the points for selection to private universities in the province such as Yang&#39;en University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope has expanded and the application threshold has also increased. Taking Shanghai as an example, not all graduates from colleges and universities on the list are eligible to apply. In addition to age and academic performance requirements, they must also meet at least one &quot;other condition&quot;, including being a member of the Communist Party of China (including probationary members) and serving as a member of the Communist Party of China for more than one year. Secretary of the Youth League Committee of the school or department and other related positions, and won the honorary title or scholarship of outstanding or three good students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the above-mentioned third category of local universities including private schools, they need to meet the conditions of receiving a national scholarship or a Shanghai scholarship, and serving as the secretary of the youth league committee of the school or department for more than one year and other related positions. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hunan Province’s 2023 student selection examination, there will no longer be a distinction between ordinary and targeted selection, and there will no longer be a limit on the positions that graduates of “double first-class” and non-”double first-class” schools can apply for, but candidates All must meet the requirements for (preparatory) party members and student cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Overseas universities are included in the selection scope&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that this time, the Shanghai selection is the first time that the top 50 universities in the world are included in the fourth category of pilot universities. For overseas college graduates, the score line will be separately determined by the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, as of September 2023, there are 10 provinces that have made it clear that they will recruit graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope of schools defined by most provinces is based on the top 100 QS World University Rankings, and candidates are required to have a master&#39;s degree or a doctorate degree or above. Some provinces have restrictions on undergraduate qualifications. For example, Hebei Province requires candidates to obtain a degree from a domestic undergraduate university that is included in the selection scope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regulations vary from place to place as to whether international students are members of the Communist Party of China or whether they have received scholarships. For example, Guangdong and Shanxi have no mandatory requirements and only indicate in the announcement that those who meet the requirements will be given priority for transfer. Beijing requires international students to meet one of the following three conditions: Chinese Communist Party (preparatory) party members, three good students and other honorary titles (obtained during the highest academic qualifications) ), with experience in joining the military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the difficulty of work in organizational departments, it may be more difficult to include graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities in the selection scope. In December 2022, some netizens left a message on the leadership message board of People&#39;s Daily Online, suggesting that Fujian include outstanding graduates from foreign schools in the selection examination. The Organization Department of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee replied, &quot;Because it is impossible to go to the school to conduct in-depth on-site inspections of the candidates and make inspection conclusions, overseas universities have not been included in the selection scope.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the selection of foreign (overseas) candidates, Sichuan recruits a large number of college graduates, and it is also the first province to take advantage of this. As early as 2015, the province issued separate relevant policies for graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities, and recruited a total of 24 graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities in the first batch, including 5 Ph.D. In 2023, among the targeted selected students in Sichuan, the number of graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities will reach 82, which is three times the number in 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, among the first batch of 24 graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities recruited by Sichuan in 2015, 4 have currently reached full-time majors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Only one or two a year”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why is the scope of selected students constantly expanding? &quot;The reason why private colleges and universities are included is that, in addition to taking care of the tendency of the city&#39;s colleges and universities, the most important thing is not to judge heroes based on their school background.&quot; A person close to the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee told the Southern Weekend reporter that candidates reported by colleges and universities will be included in the merit review. They are assigned to responsible cadres and weighted assessments are conducted based on the students&#39; basic conditions, such as awards and other indicators, and are &quot;not linked to the school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as early as May 21, 2018, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a symposium on motivating cadres to take on new responsibilities and new actions in the new era and strengthening and improving the selection and transfer of students. It mentioned that &quot;highlighting political standards, appropriate Expand the scale and select accurately by classification and classification.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the expansion of the scope of selected students in various places also has the consideration of stabilizing employment. In the aforementioned &quot;Several Measures to Optimize and Adjust Employment Stabilization Policies to Promote Development and Benefit People&#39;s Livelihood&quot; issued by the Shanghai Employment Leading Group in July 2023, it was proposed to &quot;gradually expand the scale of selection and transfer.&quot; In 2023, Chongqing announced that the number of non-directed transfers will reach 600, an increase of 50% compared with 400 the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the scope is expanded, will more graduates from private colleges and universities enter the selection sequence? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff at the employment offices of Shanghai Jianqiao College and Shanghai Sanda College told Southern Weekend reporters that “no one has been admitted to Shanghai’s selective transfer program in recent years.” A staff member from the Xianda School of Humanities and Economics at Shanghai International Studies University revealed, “There are only one or two a year.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff of Shanghai Sanda College believes that although it is possible to take the exam, &quot;it is really difficult, and scholarships, class cadres (and other requirements) must be met.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned person close to the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee said that during the examination process, the overall expressive ability of students from prestigious universities was better than that of ordinary private universities. &quot;The final admission results are in a normal distribution. Graduates from Qingbei and Renmin University More, other universities have less.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大股东违规减持被重罚：股市不能成为“韭菜收割机”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256916]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 16:15:33&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On Friday, September 15, 2023, after the stock market closed, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced: Nanjing I The major shareholder of Le Home Co., Ltd. (Wo Le Home) imposed heavy penalties. On the same day, another listed company, Oriental Fashion, announced that its chairman and actual controller had been arrested on suspicion of manipulating the securities market. Shareholders of the two companies who illegally reduced their holdings were severely fined, which shows that the regulatory authorities are serious about illegal reductions and other behaviors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission website reported on September 15 that the major shareholder Yu Fanyi, who holds 7.11% of the shares of Wole Home, and his concerted parties have illegally reduced their holdings of Wole Home shares and plan to confiscate them in accordance with the law. Those acting in concert had illegal gains of 16.53 million yuan and were severely fined 32.95 million yuan, with a total fine of 49.48 million yuan. According to the report, Yu Fanyi and his concerted parties failed to fulfill their information disclosure obligations in accordance with the law when they purchased 5% of Wole Home&#39;s shares through the secondary market in 2021 and were warned. This time, Yu Fanyi and others reduced all 7.11% of their stock holdings on September 5 and 6, 2023, once again violating the regulations that should be announced when the change in shareholding ratio reaches 5% and must not be announced within 3 days. Rules for buying and selling the stock again. In response, the China Securities Regulatory Commission decided to impose heavy penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Securities Law stipulates a number of special provisions for shareholders who hold (including jointly held through persons acting in concert) more than 5% of the shares of a listed company when buying and selling stocks: when the shareholding reaches 5%, the stock purchase and sale period shall be within 3 days. A written report shall be made to the Securities Regulatory Commission and the stock exchange, and the listed company shall be notified to make an announcement. During this period, the listed company&#39;s stocks shall not be traded again; thereafter, a report and announcement shall be made for every increase or decrease of 5%, and no further purchases shall be made within 3 days after the announcement. Buy and sell the company&#39;s stocks; after the shareholding reaches 5%, every time the shareholding increases or decreases by 1%, the listed company should be notified and announced on the next day. These regulations are made because shareholders holding more than 5% of the shares are considered important shareholders, and their stock buying and selling behavior may have an important impact on the company&#39;s stock price and affect the rights and interests of other small shareholders, so they need to be disclosed in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of establishing the stock market is to allow listed companies to obtain the funds needed for business development, while also providing investors with the opportunity to share the company&#39;s future earnings. There are usually two ways for listed companies to create value for investors, one is to increase the stock price, and the other is to pay cash dividends. However, the stock prices of many A-share listed companies have fallen below the issue price (breaking the issue), which means that the stock prices have not risen since listing, but have fallen. Although it cannot be ruled out that some investors have made profits during the rise and fall process, but Overall, investors lost money. According to statistics from Jiemian News, as of the close of trading on September 6, 2023, 758 A-share listed companies had broken their shares, accounting for a large proportion of the more than 5,000 listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s look at dividends. According to data from the China Association of Public Companies, since the establishment of the capital market, the total cumulative cash dividends of all listed companies is less than 16 trillion yuan, while the total equity financing, including initial offerings and refinancing, has reached 18 trillion yuan. The total amount of cash dividends is not as large as the total amount of financing. In other words, overall, Chinese stock market investors are still giving blood to listed companies without getting enough returns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is in this investment environment that the controlling shareholders and actual controllers of listed companies have repeatedly cashed out large amounts of money by reducing their holdings of the company&#39;s stocks, cutting off the rights of small and medium-sized shareholders. This is almost a chronic disease of A-shares, which has attracted investors&#39; attention. Criticize. The purpose of listing many A-share companies is to make money. The major shareholders and actual controllers have never thought about creating value for investors. Some companies used financial fraud and other means to pass the listing review and raise the issuance price at the beginning of their listing. After listing, they seized every opportunity to cash out, either through reduction of holdings, or through mortgage stock loans, and some refinanced again. Make money from the stock market. It is for this reason (and of course because of long-standing illegal phenomena such as information disclosure violations and stock price manipulation) that the A-share market is called a &quot;leek harvester&quot; and &quot;speculative market&quot; by some investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These unreasonable phenomena in the stock market have seriously harmed the interests of investors, especially small and medium-sized investors, and also undermined investor confidence. The recent downward trend of the A-share market is closely related to investors&#39; lack of confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to rectify the problem of large shareholders infringing on the interests of small and medium-sized shareholders, the China Securities Regulatory Commission recently promulgated new regulations &quot;Further Regulating Share Reduction Behavior&quot;, which requires listed companies to have broken shares or net losses, or have not made any cash in the past three years. If the amount of dividends and accumulated cash dividends is less than 30% of the average annual net profit in the past three years, the controlling shareholder or actual controller is not allowed to reduce the company&#39;s shares through the secondary market. That is to say, if a listed company does not create enough value for secondary market investors, its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, etc. are not allowed to realize it by reducing their holdings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of the new regulations is good, but the key is whether they can be implemented. Therefore, this time when shareholders of listed companies such as Wole Home Furnishing and Oriental Fashion illegally reduced their holdings, investors were waiting to see how the regulatory authorities would punish them. If the exchanges continue to lightly “condemn” and “warn” as before without substantive penalties, then the new regulations will obviously not have much deterrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, judging from the recently announced processing progress, the regulatory authorities are obviously serious this time: the major shareholders of Wolejia were confiscated and imposed huge fines on their illegal reduction of holdings, basically spitting out All proceeds from the shareholding reduction (including the proceeds from the legal shareholding reduction); and the chairman of Oriental Fashion was found to have other behaviors of manipulating stock prices and will be held criminally responsible. Vigorous enforcement of laws is undoubtedly of great significance in boosting market confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, restricting major shareholders and actual controllers of listed companies from reducing their holdings only blocks one way for them to realize cash. To make the capital market truly a win-win market for investors and listed companies, and to prevent listing from becoming a way for major shareholders and actual controllers to cut off leeks, more measures are needed to make it more difficult for major shareholders and actual controllers to collect money and realize cash from the stock market. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, new regulations issued by the exchange in February 2023 allow restricted shares to be loaned through refinancing channels. Some people believe that this allows strategic investors to reduce their holdings in disguised form through this mechanism, which may lead to issues such as fairness and institutional consistency. Jindi shares, which was recently listed, sold more than 4.5 million shares (equivalent to short selling) on ​​the first day of listing, with an amount of up to 220 million yuan. These securities were suspected to come from &quot;strategic investors&quot; such as company executives and core employees. Restricted shares held. Previously, there were cases where &quot;strategic investors&quot; lent large sums of restricted shares on the first day of a company&#39;s listing and sold them through securities lending. Whether this involves executives of listed companies &quot;short selling&quot; their own stocks to lock in profits on the first day of listing, and whether it will harm the interests of secondary market investors, is worthy of concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[卖惨打造“大凉山人设”卖假货，水军团伙落网]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256900]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Exciting and tense music&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Hot-selling&quot; products that are only available for ten seconds&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The quality is &quot;superior&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coupled with the tempting comments from &quot;old fans&quot; that flood the screen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many people have experienced this kind of live broadcast to bring goods? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Be careful of falling into the trap of &quot;Internet trolls&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 14 is the Rule of Law Day of the 2023 National Cyber ​​Security Publicity Week.

The public security organs work on cracking down on cyber trolls, cyber criminals, cyber hackers, cyber intrusions and other cyber chaos, and publish relevant typical cases. Among them, the Liangshan Public Security Bureau investigated a case in which an Internet celebrity anchor was created to sell miserable products, staged false images of poverty to attract traffic, hired &quot;internet trolls&quot; to increase followers and attract traffic, and used the traffic to sell counterfeit agricultural and sideline products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/17/f7837762a5dfb77c1f195f36c776d95c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/17/f7837762a5dfb77c1f195f36c776d95c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251045&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Basic case&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;Since June this year, the Liangshan Internet Security Department has discovered illegal and criminal cases involving false propaganda by &quot;Internet celebrities&quot; and selling counterfeit products for profit.
