For children, childhood without snacks is bleak, and for adults, life without snacks is incomplete. Simply put, snacks are all foods other than meals. On September 15, 2023, a study published in the &quot;European Journal of Nutrition&quot; pointed out that unhealthy snacks are counteracting the effect of healthy meals, thereby increasing the risk of obesity, stroke, cardiovascular and other diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research team from King&#39;s College London in the UK studied the snacking habits of 854 people and came to two-quarter conclusions. A quarter of people&#39;s daily energy intake comes from snacks, but a quarter of people offset the benefits of a healthy meal with unhealthy snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overall, the UK is a country that loves snacking, with 24% of people’s daily energy intake coming from snacks such as cereal bars, pastries and fruits. Snack eaters (95%) eat an average of 2.28 snacks per day, of which 47% eat two snacks per day and 29% eat more than two snacks per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A quarter (26%) of those who took part in the study reported eating healthy meals but poor quality snacks such as biscuits, crisps and cakes. Just cancel out their healthy meal. The so-called healthy meals refer to foods recommended according to dietary guidelines, such as a balanced diet based on cereals. The daily meal should include cereals and potatoes, vegetables and fruits, livestock, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, and legumes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unhealthy (poor quality) snacks are highly processed and sugary snacks. The classification of snacks is now roughly divided into original product snacks, initially processed snacks and deeply processed snacks. The first two are healthy snacks and the latter are unhealthy snacks. Take the potato chips that Westerners like to eat as an example. If they are cooked potatoes or potato chips with a little salt, they are original and primarily processed snacks. If they are fried and baked with various seasonings and made into potato chips, they are deeply processed snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although highly processed snacks account for only 1/3 of the average person’s daily food intake, their impact on the body can offset healthy meals, resulting in higher body mass index (BMI) and higher visceral fat. and higher triglyceride concentrations, all of which are associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. This is a classic example of bad money beating good money when it comes to nutrition and health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Brits, popular snacks are biscuits, fruit, nuts and seeds, cheese and butter, cakes and pies, granola or cereal bars. Among them, unhealthy foods are cakes, cookies, pies, donuts, pastries, candies, ice cream and frozen dairy desserts, while nuts and seeds are among the healthier snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese people also like to eat snacks. In 2018, the &quot;Report on the Development of the Snack Industry in the Context of Consumption Upgrading&quot; released by the Ministry of Commerce of China pointed out that the total annual output value of China&#39;s snack industry has reached 2.21564 billion yuan. Although in recent years, snack manufacturers and sellers have promoted natural, whole grain, sugar-free, and additive-free snacks as popular labels for healthy snacks, unhealthy snacks are still flooding the market, including fried foods and pickled foods. , processed meat products (dried meat, floss, sausage, ham, etc.), biscuit foods (including all processed biscuits), soda and cola drinks, convenience foods (mainly instant noodles and puffed foods), canned foods, plums Candied fruit foods, frozen dessert foods (ice cream, popsicles, ice cream, etc.), barbecue foods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Spice strips, a famous Chinese snack that is widely loved by people at home and abroad, is an unhealthy snack (famous diver Quan Hongchan said that she likes spicy strips the most, and some manufacturers even sent her snacks. A cart of spicy strips). This is a type of cooked food product close to gluten type. It is made from wheat flour and/or other cereal flours as raw materials, added with salt, oil and other auxiliary materials, and processed through ingredients, extrusion cooking, molding, seasoning, packaging and other processes. There are less than 10 kinds of ingredients, but more than 10 kinds of food additives, and some even 20 kinds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This snack is high in oil and salt. A pack of spicy strips has a net content of 100 grams, of which fat accounts for 25 grams. According to the recommendations of the &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents&quot;, the average daily edible oil intake per person is 25-30 grams. The oil content in a pack of spicy strips is equivalent to people&#39;s daily fat intake. At the same time, a pack of spicy strips contains 7.3 grams of salt. Also according to the guidelines, the daily salt intake of healthy adults should not exceed 6 grams, children aged 2-3 should not exceed 2 grams, and children aged 4-6 should not exceed 3 grams. Children aged 7-10 years old should not exceed 4 grams. Elderly people over 65 years old should not exceed 5 grams. The salt content in a pack of spicy strips exceeds the recommended salt intake for adults and far exceeds the recommended amount for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For children, it is this kind of unhealthy snacks that develops their later eating habits and tastes, lays the foundation for year-round intake of unhealthy diets, and also contributes to cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, obesity, and diabetes. Hidden dangers have been laid. Of course, unhealthy snacks also rely on their addictive properties to attract people and affect their health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another recently published study shows that highly processed foods, whether snacks or meals, rewire the brain&#39;s reward circuitry and activate the brain in a manner similar to cravings for cocaine. Highly processed foods can trigger addiction related to drugs or alcohol. One mechanism is that highly processed foods cause the release of dopamine in the brain (similar to amphetamine) and can lead to withdrawal symptoms (at least in children and teenagers), two hallmarks of addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Highly processed foods contain large amounts of sugar, salt, fat, artificial colors or preservatives, and contain other ingredients such as hydrogenated fats, fillers and starches to maximize flavor (called optimal taste point), thereby attracting people to continue eating. Moreover, hydrogenated fat or non-dairy creamer (creamer) tastes better than natural milk. Many people like to add it to their coffee. This delicious agent is also widely used in processed beverages and makes people addicted. This kind of fat is more harmful and difficult for the human body to decompose, and will aggravate the development of vascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis. Processed fructose, which is sweet and delicious, is also commonly used in beverages such as hydrogenated fat or non-dairy creamer, which can increase the occurrence of metabolic diseases and lead to addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course you have to eat snacks. The easiest way is to replace unhealthy snacks such as biscuits, potato chips and cakes with healthy snacks such as fruits and nuts. There are many healthy snack options, including fresh, natural foods. Vegetables such as cucumbers, tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, etc.; fruits such as strawberries, mangos, apples, pears, etc.; milks such as pure milk, sugar-free yogurt, low-salt cheese, etc.; beans such as sugar-free soy milk, tofu pudding, edamame, etc.; Original nuts such as walnuts, almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pine nuts, dried fruits, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not impossible to eat biscuits and pastries, but you should choose those made with low sugar, salt and grains. The time when you eat snacks is also crucial to your health. If you eat snacks after 9 pm, your blood indicators will be worse and it will have a greater negative impact on your health. Therefore, you should not eat or eat less snacks after 9 pm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[叙利亚总统19年后再访华：加深两国政治互信，寻求经济合作]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257517]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 21, there was a gentle breeze in Hangzhou. As the plane landed at Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, Syrian President Bashar Assad&#39;s visit to China officially began. This is Assad’s first visit to China in 19 years since 2004. During this trip, Bashar will also attend the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria are both countries with ancient civilizations. From the connection due to the &quot;Silk Road&quot; to the connection between the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative and Syria&#39;s &quot;Eastward&quot; strategy, economic and cultural exchanges between China and Syria have continued to deepen. In fact, friendly relations will become stronger over time. What is the deep meaning behind Assad’s visit to China? How can China-Syria relations be further developed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at Fudan University, and Wang Jin, associate professor at the Institute of Middle East Studies at Northwest University, pointed out to Nandu and N video reporters that Bashar’s visit to China not only hopes that China will continue to work on the reconstruction process of Syria There are also economic considerations in playing an active role. Wang Jin also emphasized that future exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria and an important guarantee for the development of bilateral relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“This visit to China will help deepen political mutual trust between the two countries”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the Syrian National News Agency, Bashar led a high-level delegation in On September 21, he set off for a visit to China and participated in relevant activities in Beijing and Hangzhou. Nandu reporters noticed that Bashar’s last visit to China was in 2004, which was also the first visit to China by a Syrian head of state since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Syria in 1956. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c2fb9eec2add497b898cc7fa7ac85d2d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c2fb9eec2add497b898cc7fa7ac85d2d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251764&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Xinhua News Agency/AP&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria have a profound friendship. Syria was one of the first Arab countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People&#39;s Republic of China and one of the sponsors of the restoration of China&#39;s lawful seat in the United Nations. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 67 years ago, China-Syria relations have maintained healthy and stable development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The diplomacy of the heads of state plays a leading role in the development of China-Syria relations.” Sun Degang believes that China and Syria have the same views on safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and also have a common understanding of the multi-polar pattern. Diplomacy has played an overt role in deepening practical cooperation between the two sides in many fields.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this visit to China, Bashar had already visited Iran last year, and this year visited Oman, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and China are the sixth stop of his visit since the civil war broke out in 2011. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 19 years, Assad visits China again. What is the deep meaning behind it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the world is undergoing major changes unprecedented in a century, and global peace and development are facing increasing uncertainties and unstable factors. Against the background of the &quot;reconciliation wave&quot; emerging in the Middle East, Sun Degang believes that the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China will help deepen political mutual trust between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Bashar’s visit to China is first of all hoping to receive political support from China, including continuing to support Syria in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continuing to play an active and constructive role in Syria’s reconstruction process. , to properly promote the reconstruction process in Syria.&quot; Wang Jin analyzed to the Nandu reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2011, the Syrian civil war broke out. Iran firmly supported the Bashar al-Assad government. The League of Arab States (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Arab League&quot;) suspended Syria&#39;s membership. Saudi Arabia and many other Arab countries closed their offices in Syria. embassy, ​​Syrian diplomacy has entered a state of relative isolation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/0fdbc92fb640cd041da104ad87aabb0d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/0fdbc92fb640cd041da104ad87aabb0d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251765&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The war-torn town of Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria, taken on September 10, 2013. Xinhua News Agency/AFP&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this situation, China has always maintained relations with Syria and defended fairness and justice in global human rights governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“China and Syria have a very solid foundation of political mutual trust.” This year marks the tenth anniversary of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. Sun Degang told Nandu reporters that Syria has always supported China’s “Belt and Road” initiative and the global development initiatives and global security initiatives, and firmly supports China on the South China Sea, Xinjiang-related issues and other issues; China also firmly supports Syria in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, has upheld justice on many occasions in relevant votes of the United Nations Security Council, and defended Syria&#39;s national sovereignty and territorial integrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned that as a permanent member of the Security Council, most of the vetoes used by China in relevant votes of the Security Council are related to the Syrian issue. China has always spoken out fairly and acted in accordance with the merits and in safeguarding the interests of the Syrian people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The &#39;reconciliation tide&#39; in the Middle East has brought peace dividends to Syria&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On March 10 this year, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached the &quot;Beijing Agreement&quot;. The three parties signed and issued a joint statement announcing that Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to resume diplomatic relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China is a sincere friend of Arab countries, and Chinese wisdom is constantly recognized by Arab countries. On April 29, when meeting with Zhai Jun, the Chinese government’s special envoy for the Middle East, Assad congratulated China on successfully mediating the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and believed that reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran would have an important and positive impact on the international pattern and regional situation. Syria thanks China for its active work in promoting Syria to improve relations with other Arab countries, and welcomes China to play a greater role in maintaining regional peace and stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Syrian civil war, Saudi Arabia announced its severing of diplomatic relations with Syria in 2012 due to its opposition to the Assad government. Two months after Saudi Arabia resumed diplomatic relations with Iran this year, Saudi Arabia and Syria also announced on May 9 that the two countries had resumed diplomatic relations. Sun Degang told Nandu reporters that China has promoted the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, driving a &quot;tide of reconciliation&quot; in the Middle East and bringing peace dividends to Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Syria’s relations with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey and other countries have further improved, and Syria’s external living space has been greatly improved. This will also help to enhance China-Syria relations, Deepen bilateral cooperation,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 10, Bashar was invited to attend the Arab League Summit Council meeting in Saudi Arabia. On May 22, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China congratulated President Bashar on attending the Arab League Summit Council meeting and on the reunion of the Arab family. Syria&#39;s return to the Arab League fully demonstrates that Arab countries&#39; strengthening of unity and cooperation through dialogue and consultation is the aspiration of the people and the general trend. It also fully demonstrates that Arab countries have the ability to take their future and destiny into their own hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin believes that China’s global security initiative has effectively promoted world peace and development. “We hope to form a new security concept around the world that does not sacrifice mutual security. Rather, they are concerned about each other&#39;s security and form a bond of common interests in cooperation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;China and Syria have economic cooperation advantages&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2011 After the turmoil in Syria, the economic and trade cooperation between China and Syria was affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the bilateral trade volume between China and Syria will be US$427 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11.65%. Among them, China’s imports were US$20 million, a year-on-year increase of 124%; China’s exports were US$425 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11.93%. China mainly exports mechanical and electrical products, light industrial products, etc. to Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin admitted to Nandu reporters that due to the long-term sanctions imposed by Western countries, there are certain difficulties in cooperation between Syria and China, and it is necessary to understand rationally and steadily promote economic and trade cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to his observation, the prospects for China-Syria economic and trade cooperation are very broad. &quot;Syria is rich in natural resources such as oil and has a superior geographical location. It is adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea and is an important bridge connecting Europe and Asia. Therefore, China and Syria have very great economic cooperation advantages.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters noted that previous meetings There is no shortage of products from Syria at the CIIE. Damask rose is one of the oldest rose species in the world, and the essential oil extracted from it is called &quot;liquid gold&quot; by locals. At the CIIE booths, in addition to the fragrance of rose essential oil, there are also Syrian products such as olive oil and castile soap. Many Syrian companies feel the potential of the Chinese market at the CIIE. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-Syria relations have a long history. Aleppo and Palmyra in Syria were important cities on the ancient Silk Road. On January 12, 2022 local time, China and Syria formally signed the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding on Jointly Promoting the Construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road&quot;, and Syria officially joined the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Syrian political analyst and author Kosay Abido believes that the cooperation agreement between the two countries can be expanded to areas such as food, pharmaceuticals and technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the new historical conditions, China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative is aligned with Syria’s “Look East” strategy. China’s participation in Syria’s economic reconstruction has become deeper and more substantial, and China-Syria relations have reached a new level. steps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Currently, the Syrian government forces have controlled most of the land, and post-war reconstruction is on the agenda. I think the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China will focus on cooperation with China in practical fields.&quot; Sun Degang analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters noticed that the Syrian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade was also among the Syrian delegation visiting China. In this regard, Sun Degang believes that this reflects Syria&#39;s hope that China will leverage its infrastructure advantages in the reconstruction process of Syria, including transportation, electricity and other infrastructure construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the economically powerful Gulf Arab countries are willing to provide financial support to Syria, and China leverages its infrastructure advantages, relevant cooperation can steadily promote Syria&#39;s economic and social reconstruction.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Syria had already shown its willingness to seek economic cooperation with China before visiting China. According to reports from the Syrian Arab News Agency and the Russian Satellite News Agency, on April 29 this year, when Bashar met with Zhai Jun, he specifically mentioned that it was becoming increasingly necessary to abandon the use of the U.S. dollar and that trade between countries could be settled in RMB. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin analyzed to reporters from Nandu that Syria’s visit to China also has economic considerations. &quot;Syria also hopes that China will provide more economic support and assistance, especially welcoming more Chinese investors to invest in Syria and participate in Syria&#39;s socio-economic reconstruction.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 6 this year, southern Turkey approached Two strong earthquakes occurred in the Syrian border area within 12 hours, and China actively provided assistance. &quot;China will also be an important force in improving people&#39;s livelihood in Syria in the future.&quot; Sun Degang believes that the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China, in addition to deepening political mutual trust and strengthening economic and trade exchanges, will also help China and Syria strengthen cooperation in health, education, sports and other fields. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said on 9 It was announced on March 21 that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Asian Games is a sports event for Asian youth and an important platform for cultural exchanges. &quot;This is a very important moment.&quot; Wang Jin believes that Assad&#39;s attendance at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games will bring important opportunities for people-to-people diplomacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Leaders gather at this international cultural and sports event to share each other’s views, and head-of-state diplomacy also adds luster to this international event.” He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sports represents youth, health, and vitality, and is related to people&#39;s happiness and the future of the nation. It is reported that the Syrian team will participate in six competitions including wrestling, boxing, and weightlifting at this Asian Games. Athletes from China and Syria gathered together to add color to the diversity of the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Syrian president&#39;s coming to China to attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Games has sent a signal - he hopes that China and Syria can strengthen cooperation in the humanities field.&quot; Sun Degang told the Nandu reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria are both ancient civilizations. The exchanges between the two countries were connected by the &quot;Silk Road&quot; and continue to this day. The &quot;Silk Road&quot;, called the &quot;Road of Semiramis&quot; by the ancient Assyrians, started in China and passed through the land of Syria to Europe and the Maghreb region. The Syrian Minister of Culture once said that this road has enabled the Syrian people and the Chinese people to get to know each other and established a bridge for cultural exchanges. Customs, beliefs, and lifestyles have also influenced each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, ancient Chinese silk fabrics and ancient porcelain are collected in museums in Syria. The &quot;Stele of Popular Chinese Nestorianism in the Qin Dynasty&quot; collected by the Xi&#39;an Forest of Steles Museum in China has ancient Syrian inscriptions... each piece is precious. Cultural relics bear witness to the long history of cultural exchanges and mutual learning between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/cf852266838b78b9744c286623c27e8d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/cf852266838b78b9744c286623c27e8d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251766&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Recently, the &quot;Syrian Ancient Cultural Relics Exhibition&quot; was displayed at the Guangdong Provincial Museum. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 20 this year, the &quot;Syrian Ancient Cultural Relics Exhibition&quot; co-organized by the Guangdong Provincial Museum and the China Cultural Relics Exchange Center was displayed at the Guangdong Provincial Museum. The exhibition brings together 210 pieces/sets of exquisite cultural relics from 9 Syrian museums including the National Museum in Damascus and the Aleppo Museum, as well as 4 Chinese museums including the Dunhuang Academy, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Museum, the Xi&#39;an Forest of Steles Museum and the Guangdong Provincial Museum. It paints a picture of the magnificent civilization and history of ancient Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin told reporters from Nandu that China and Syria are both countries with ancient civilizations, and exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations are of great significance to China and Syria. &quot;Both countries advocate dialogue among civilizations. In recent years, China has proposed the principle of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations, which has been welcomed and supported by Syria and recognized by the Syrian government and people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-Syria relations have been affected by the rise of Eastern civilization. The common attributes are closely linked, and the two countries have great potential for cultural cooperation. Syria actively appreciates China&#39;s global civilization initiative, which promotes mutual respect among different civilizations and breaks down the &quot;clash of civilizations theory&quot;, &quot;civilization superiority theory&quot; and &quot;Western civilization-centered theory&quot;. In Sun Degang’s view, China-Syria cultural exchanges are a vivid reflection of China’s global civilization initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the future, exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria, and an important guarantee for the development of relations between the two countries. They will add luster to exchanges and mutual learning among world civilizations,&quot; Wang Jin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[羊奶、牦牛奶、骆驼奶……小众奶有号称的那么神奇吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257529]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission selected 32 liquid milks with high sales for evaluation, including I don’t know if the results of some niche milk products may surprise you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, with the development of the economy and the diversification of consumer demand, there are more and more milk varieties on the market. In addition to cow&#39;s milk, there are also goat milk, and the uncommon buffalo milk, &quot;Niche milk&quot; such as yak milk and camel milk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, these &quot;niche milks&quot; are claimed to have miraculous properties. For example, camel milk is said to be rich in high-quality protein, vitamins, calcium, iron, amino acids, taurine and folic acid. Regular consumption of camel milk can enhance human immunity and delay aging. The drinks of centenarians in Xinjiang are indispensable for camel milk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is yak milk. Because yaks are distributed in high-altitude areas in Tibet, Sichuan, and Qinghai and are resistant to cold, low temperatures, and hypoxia, the dairy products they produce are known as &quot;natural concentrated milk.&quot; It is said that yak milk is rich in nutrients, such as lactoferrin, A2 protein, conjugated linoleic acid, etc. In short, it is higher than other cow&#39;s milk. It is said that &quot;drinking one cup of yak milk is worth drinking several cups of ordinary milk.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under these publicity, &quot;niche milk&quot; has gradually become a new consumer favorite in the dairy market. On an e-commerce platform, the transaction volume of imported plant milk increased by 176% year-on-year in 2019, and the imported goat milk powder increased by more than 50% year-on-year. The market size of yak milk products has increased from 400 million yuan in 2014 to about 1.45 billion yuan in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, are these niche milks so magical? This evaluation by the Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission answers this question to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nutrition refers to the biotin that can be obtained from food and is necessary for the body. When people eat, food enters the body, is digested by the gastrointestinal tract, and absorbs the nutrients in it, supplying energy to the body, forming and renewing body tissues. Nutrition is divided into seven major nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, and dietary fiber. In 1973, an expert committee organized by the WHO confirmed a total of 42 essential nutrients for the human body. Any one of these 42 species cannot be deficient, otherwise related nutritional deficiency diseases will occur. Therefore, whether something is nutritious can be quantified. For dairy products, the main function of drinking milk is to supplement protein and calcium, which are indicators that dairy products must be labeled. Then, the nutritional content of dairy products can be quantified through experiments and quantitative comparisons can be made. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This experiment by the Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission compared 32 niche milks, including 6 buffalo milk, 7 yak milk, 6 camel milk, 6 goat milk and 7 cow milk ( Milk is mostly mid- to high-end products), with prices ranging from 1.5 yuan/100mL to 25.4 yuan/100mL. The results show that the protein content of 32 samples is 3.0g/100mL-4.3g/100mL. Among them, buffalo milk and cow&#39;s milk ranked first and second in protein content, with average values ​​of 4.2g/100mL and 4.0g/100mL respectively. Goat milk had the lowest protein content, with an average value of 3.2g/100mL. In terms of calcium content, camel milk has the highest calcium content, with an average value of 164.0mg/100mL; followed by buffalo milk, with an average value of 152.3mg/100mL; goat milk has the lowest calcium content, with an average value of 123.3mg/100mL. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is a commodity, a very important indicator is cost performance. The average price of camel milk is relatively high, reaching 22 yuan/100ml, which is nearly eight times the price of buffalo milk, but there is no obvious advantage in nutritional value. Generally speaking, buffalo milk and cow&#39;s milk have relatively high calcium and protein contents, making them the most cost-effective products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This result may be unexpected by many people, but it is reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the modern dairy industry, the breeds of dairy cows are slowly developed through long-term industrial production and technology; the breeding methods are also constantly developing towards improving the nutrition of milk; the cost of feeding is also Gradually reduced in the fierce market competition. This ensures that the milk we usually drink is the most cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the niche milk industry is small in scale, relatively backward in development, and naturally not cost-effective. For example, yaks have a low degree of artificial selection and are primitive cattle breeds. Their reproduction mainly relies on free mating within the group, which may lead to population degradation and reduced production performance. The daily milk production of yaks is low and the lactation period is short. The average annual milk production is mainly for feeding calves. Although there is also scientific research and improvement, the investment in a small industry is definitely not much. So, to some extent, yak milk is destined to be expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, to a certain extent, the nutrition of milk is not important, because the same protein and calcium can be obtained in lower-cost ways, such as eating eggs to obtain protein. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a traditional understanding in China that the nutrients are all in the soup. Following this idea, one would think that liquid milk is rich in nutrients. But actually, the nutrients are in the solids. Under normal circumstances, the human body needs about 50 to 60 grams of protein a day. The protein content of 100 grams of protein powder is about 75 grams. In natural food, a pound of pork contains about 100 to 120 grams of protein; a pound of chicken breast has 150 grams of protein; and each ordinary egg contains about 6 grams of protein. In other words, 5 pounds of milk is equivalent to 1 pound of pork, and 7 pounds of milk is equivalent to 1 pound of chicken breast. Milk itself may not be a cost-effective nutritional product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, for a healthy person with normal financial status, protein deficiency will not occur. This small difference in the protein content of dairy products is simply unimportant and not worth the extra money. What&#39;s more, the nutritional needs of the human body in different eras are different. In the era of poverty, people lacked protein, fat, and sugar; in the current era of abundance, protein, fat, and sugar may exceed standards. What people lack are vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and what they focus on is nutritional balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, there is nothing wrong with drinking niche milk, but don’t place unrealistic hopes on it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运会盛大开幕，电子烟花、数字点火仪式让人耳目一新]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257523]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the five-star red flag was displayed at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games The lighting effect when entering is Chinese red.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/4ef85dd71d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/4ef85dd71d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251794&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;On September 23, 2023, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games, the lighting effect when the five-star red flag entered the venue was Chinese red. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At about 20 pm on September 23, 2023, the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou was held in the main gymnasium of Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 23, 2023, eight people including Sun Haiping and Guo Jingjing will serve as flag bearers of the Olympic Council of Asia.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/09/24/26640b53ec.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/24/26640b53ec.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251795&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 23, 2023, eight people including Sun Haiping and Guo Jingjing served as flag bearers of the Olympic Council of Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, artistic performance at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games. 1&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/24/b307bc106c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/ b307bc106c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251796&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, a cultural performance was performed at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The opening ceremony was themed &quot;Tide from Asia&quot; and was divided into three major chapters: &quot;National Style and Elegance&quot;, &quot;Qiantang Tide&quot; and &quot;Hand in Hand&quot;, which symbolized In the new era, China is integrating with Asia and the world, rushing forward like a wave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, artistic performance at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games. 2&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/24/d8fc4e904c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/ d8fc4e904c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251797&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, a cultural performance was performed at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​of the highlights of the opening ceremony of this Asian Games is that no physical fireworks will be set off throughout the event, and instead electronic fireworks will be set off through digital technology.

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个研究爱情与情感的社会学者最常被问到的是：为什么这是一个社会学课题？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对此伊娃·易洛斯早就身经百战，“爱情伴随着现代性，从这个意义上来说，它对社会学有着极其重要的意义。著名的社会学家涂尔干讨论过单身汉与自杀的关系，马克思与恩格斯写过婚姻与利益、爱情与利益的关系，马克斯·韦伯研究性爱，即使这些并非他们作品的核心。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;先不论社会学对现代性的执着。实际上，伊娃·易洛斯的作品都与自身困惑有关。若干年前还在美国读博时，她当时的男朋友生日，但她生活拮据，无力邀请男友去餐厅，只好亲自动手。“但是当我想要为他做饭时，我意识到我需要买蜡烛、做一些高级的食物，而我甚至没有桌布。为了营造一个浪漫的晚餐氛围，我需要花钱，而我当时没有钱。”她后来出版的第一本书《消费浪漫的乌托邦：爱与资本主义的文化悖论》便与这一经验有关。在书中，她聚焦于浪漫爱与消费文化的紧密联系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/wO6qeoIC9QkxpJ1sO1z55d0m29hmfIdYK68V3NV0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1563&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/wO6qeoIC9QkxpJ1sO1z55d0m29hmfIdYK68V3NV0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251366&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为情感社会学家，伊娃·易洛斯始终好奇情感实践和相关观念的改变。19世纪，当爱情从家庭领域进入公共领域，约会文化也应运而生，彼时欧美的浪漫主义文学作品着力于描摹人们对浪漫爱情的不懈追求——《包法利夫人》刻画一位为了追求浪漫爱几度逃离家庭、最后却债台高筑走投无路的女性；《呼啸山庄》写了一对青梅竹马的恋人希斯克利夫与凯瑟琳，凯瑟琳出于门当户对的考虑决定嫁给埃德加，希斯克利夫感到屈辱，愤而出走，几年后回到庄园复仇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迥异于此，当代的爱情常常充斥着更多理性计算。伊娃·易洛斯认为，互联网技术的发展破坏了人们对浪漫爱情的追逐，“我们不再像以前那样靠赏金猎人或摩天轮上收获的好运来寻找爱情，而是通过成本效益分析来寻找匹配的对象。”如今大行其道的交友软件大概是最好的例证，正如她在《冷亲密》（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;中译本于2023年4月出版&lt;/span>;）中所述，“大部分的爱情魔力都与对象资源的稀缺性有关，正所谓物以稀为贵，这种稀缺性反过来会带来惊喜和兴奋。相较之下，宰制当下互联网的是过剩的经济体系、过多的可选项，这就使得自我必须进行选择，并且进行最优化的选择。而互联网技术恰巧融合了两种找寻自我的方式：心理学和消费主义——刺激了人们想为自己找到最佳（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;从经济和心理上&lt;/span>;）交易的需求。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/SyjPK1W4qQR6A6dtbCgz5qYOb9FGYSkoWlffmOpX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1596&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/SyjPK1W4qQR6A6dtbCgz5qYOb9FGYSkoWlffmOpX.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;她无意指出现代爱情总是不幸福的，相反，她总结履行现代爱情和亲密关系诺言的种种表现——“平等、自由、追求性满足、无性别身份的关爱和自主性”，并认为只要人们“在异性恋或同性恋亲密关系中”履行了上述诺言，他们的亲密关系必然是幸福的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“只是，”伊娃·易洛斯说，“对一名学者而言更亟需关注的是不幸福。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/lshhUuojPVwn97OODu7Ev8YHkfdFWAF2oEgkq28q.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;伊娃·易洛斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;你提了一个很好的问题。为什么有些叙述相比其他叙述更不乏拥趸？为什么有些叙述如此强大，以至于我们很难超越它们去思考或解释发生在我们身上的事情？让我试着给出几种不同的解释：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，心理学家和精神分析师早早就知道要通过学位、资质证明和大学课程组织自己成为一个专家。通过组织能力，他们迅速获得了合法性，因为这是一门旨在疗愈、改善、克服失调和缺陷的学科，完美适配了现代机构的核心使命：促进进步、推动道德改革、减轻痛苦、增加幸福感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，现代机构基本上是功利主义的，而心理学则将这种功利主义的哲学思想应用于心灵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三个原因在于社会的深刻变革，所有的社会关系趋于民主化，社会学者称之为社会角色（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;记者注：在社会学理论中，“社会角色”规定一个人活动的特定范围和与人的地位相适应的权利义务、行为规范，是社会对一个处于特定地位的人的行为期待&lt;/span>;）的作用不再发挥基础性作用。也就是说，人们虽然是父亲和丈夫、母亲和妻子、女朋友和朋友，但并不知道如何在其中扮演自己的角色，而所有这些角色都伴随着人们的个性和真实自我。这意味着我们不再有指导方针。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大家对于心理学的需求既来自于社会角色的消失，也来自于明确的指导方针和权威的消失。个体应该从内部知道自己是谁以及应该做什么。但问题是，他们常常不知道该怎么做。心理学是一种应对各种不确定性的实践：我是谁？我应该做什么？我应该优先考虑快乐还是责任？在一个社会和神圣宇宙预先安排好的世界中，对这些问题的回答是显而易见的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5RXnjGIsyIRQfkM8GJTfAJCw9jZOMTpqad9p4akl.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;伊娃·易洛斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;2016年，交友软件Hinge发现，该应用程序的每500次滑动中有1次交换电话号码。同年，该公司进一步调查了其300名用户，结果显示，81％的用户从未在任何基于滑动的交友软件上找到过长期关系（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;数据来自于《大西洋月刊》&lt;/span>;）。然而，互联网交友网站一直非常赚钱，因为它们能够将遇到某人的希望商品化，而这种希望使人们即使有幻灭感也愿意继续使用。我认为失望和重新振作之间的摇摆是人们使用网络交友的核心。是的，我认为它确实代表了对传统爱情模式的一些背离，但它同时希望维护传统模式。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;客观地讲，传统浪漫爱情发生在小的社会关系网络里。很多时候，人们彼此认识，要么是通过父母，要么是通过名声，属于相同的圈层。相较而言，网络邂逅的社会关系更加分散。另一个变化是，人们的选择范围变得异常广泛。这是全新的，改变了人际关系的生态。一般而言，我们对他人产生情感依恋，往往基于我们认为这件事可能发生的基础之上。如果你住在一个村庄里，你只能从这个范围内选择。但如果选择范围扩大，你会认为自己有更好的选择，会快速转向下一个人。分手的成本也低得多，因为你认为你可以找到旗鼓相当的或更好的人。&lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;想象力一直是浪漫爱情的一部分&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;使用社交软件交友的人对关系的定义更加细致，也发展出了很多术语，比如约炮、FWB(friends with benefit，指既是友情，却又包含着性关系的关系。他们没有承诺和约束，也没有情感上的依恋)、situationship（指两个人的关系比朋友更亲密，却又没到恋人的程度）等等。相较于过去，为什么现代人的关系更加脆弱和不确定了？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;伊娃·易洛斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;简单点说，这是因为我们有自由去处理我们的关系和我们自身。个人不再被社会角色和规则所定义，他们必须自己创造这些角色和规则，这也带来了混乱和不确定性。混乱与不确定性被视为心理学范畴，但我认为它们也应该属于社会学范畴，这是因为混乱与不确定性中的许多情境是由个体定义的，而个体的行为规则与传统社会的运作方式往往很不一样。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;传统对浪漫爱情的想象既基于身体的吸引，也基于过往积累的经验；而互联网将想象与人们的真实相遇分隔开来，让两者发生在不同的时间点上。因而，一些人常常面临“奔现即下头”的窘境，继而放弃用交友软件寻找爱情的念头。究竟什么样的人能够在网络上建立起私人的恋爱关系？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;伊娃·易洛斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我不确定我们能否确定谁能在网络中建立关系。你是说与一个从未见过也永远不会见面的人建立关系吗？还是说一段始于网上并在线下延续的关系？想象力一直是浪漫爱情的一部分，你会把许多虚构的美德赋予你爱的人。有时人们会爱上从未说过话的人。劳拉和彼特拉克是西方文艺复兴历史上最著名的情侣之一，可事实上他们几乎从未交流过。彼特拉克像人们爱圣母玛利亚一样爱着劳拉，或者说，他如同一个少年爱上流行歌手一样爱着劳拉。互联网的不同之处在于——你已经知道了很多这个人的相关信息，除了最重要的一点：他们的实际存在对你有什么影响。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;爱，自由，承诺恐惧症&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;交友软件的另一重困境是双方确定关系困难。你在《爱，为什么痛？》一书中写道，“尽管承诺恐惧症看似同时适用于男性和女性，但不管从时间维度看还是从文化维度看，承诺恐惧都是男性特有的，相较而言，女性更愿意缔结承诺关系。”是什么造成了这种差异？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;伊娃·易洛斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;男性习得（cultivate）权力和控制，这意味着他们不能让自己展露脆弱。另一方面，女性要负责社会几乎所有的照护工作。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在上述背景下，主张性自由的约会市场是否加剧了性别不平等？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;伊娃·易洛斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;它朝着相互矛盾的方向发展了。异性之间的相遇变得更加性化，也就是说，性是目标，人的价值很大程度上是根据他们的性吸引力来确定的。一个非常有吸引力的女人在性领域会比很多男人拥有更多的权力。但总的来说，性领域仍然主要由有权有势的男人所主导，他们可以控制年轻而有魅力的女性。特朗普和梅拉尼娅就是学者宝拉·塔贝（Paola Tabet）所说的异性恋交易（heterosexual bargain）的典型案例：女人（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;最好是美丽的&lt;/span>;）提供性，男人给予她权力（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;以金钱或社会关系网的形式&lt;/span>;）。传统上，在性领域中，男人有权力，女人有性，他们进行交换。在性自由的市场中，当人们没有禁忌或禁令去获得性时，情况将变得更加复杂。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现代爱情主张恋爱、婚姻、性的自由，它强调人们有缔结关系的自由，其实也等于说，人们有离开关系的自由。你称之为当代关系的消极结构。尽管自由常常被赋予积极含义，但在亲密关系中不一定如此。你如何看待爱与自由的关系？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;伊娃·易洛斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;自由的历史很复杂。当我们谈及自由，它大多被看作是政治和经济方面的，比如天赋人权，资本主义市场为商品流通和工人与资本家之间的合同提供了很大的自由度。但也存在一种情感自由的历史，也许早于先前两种历史：即个人要求从父权、君主和社区中获得自主权，爱在其中扮演着重要角色。特里斯坦与伊索尔德或罗密欧与朱丽叶之所以在我们的经典中留存，恰恰是因为他们展现了个体从社群中获得自由的过程。在西方，爱与自由是一对同义词，即对个体自主权的肯定。但是，这种自由已经变成了我说的“当代关系的消极结构”，即人们说不和拒绝进入一段关系的自由。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;研究情感社会学多年，你认为亲密关系的走向只有更加消极和疏离吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;伊娃·易洛斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我认为我们现在对亲密关系有着更高的要求：尊重我们；表达我们的真实自我；教育我们；激起我们的兴趣。这远远超过了我们过去对它的期望。相较过去，我们从亲密关系中获得了更多的亲密感，但我们也更关注我们自身的情绪，以及我们是否被尊重——这些都会使亲密关系变得更加流动，也更容易被点燃（explosive）。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

Examining this case, which was selected for inclusion in the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate&#39;s work report to the National People&#39;s Congress, may help prevent unjust, false and wrong cases from recurring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Red Star News, what led to Tan Xiuyi’s injustice was a massacre that occurred in the summer of 1993: On the evening of July 16, 1993, Tan Hong, a villager in Qiantan Village, Tanzhuang Town, Shangshui County, Zhoukou, Henan Province ( A family of three (pseudonym) and his parents were murdered, and Tan Xiuyi, a 39-year-old fellow villager at the time, was identified as a suspect. At the end of 1999, the Zhoukou Intermediate Court made a first-instance verdict on the case and sentenced Tan Xiuyi to a suspended death sentence for intentional homicide. The first-instance verdict shows that the court found that: at about 22:00 on the evening of July 16, 1993, when Tan Xiuyi went home to relieve himself in the toilet, he saw Tan Hong, who was staying at his home that night, and became malicious and raped her. Fearing that the matter would be exposed, Tan Xiuyi had the idea of ​​killing Tan Hong&#39;s parents. At 1 a.m. on July 17, Tan Xiuyi sneaked into Tan Hong&#39;s home with the tools of the crime and killed his parents. Later, Tan Xiuyi was afraid that Tan Hong would doubt him after learning that his parents had been killed, so he killed Tan Hong after she got up and returned home, and hung her body from the beam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Tan Xiuyi appealed, in May 2000, the Henan High Court ruled to revoke the original verdict and remand the case for retrial on the grounds that the facts were unclear. In January 2002, the Zhoukou City Intermediate People&#39;s Court made a retrial judgment. In addition to intentional homicide, Tan Xiuyi was also found guilty of rape, and his sentence was maintained with a suspended death penalty. Tan Xiuyi appealed again, but this time the Henan High Court rejected the appeal in 2003 and upheld the original verdict. Ten years later, this tragedy seems to have become an &quot;iron case&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Tan Xiuyi did not give up. He kept appealing and had his experience rejected: In December 2017, the Henan Provincial High Court ruled that &quot;the facts found in the original judgment were clear, the evidence was indeed sufficient, and the conviction and sentencing were not inappropriate.&quot; dismissed the complaint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until 2018, after the Henan Provincial Procuratorate filed the case for review, it believed that the facts determined in the original trial were unclear, the evidence was unreliable and insufficient, and the judgment was wrong. On June 18, 2020, it filed a protest with the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate. The Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate lodged a protest with the Supreme People&#39;s Court on March 16, 2022. Four months later, the Supreme People&#39;s Court made a retrial decision and ordered the Henan High Court to retrial. This time, the Henan High Court changed the verdict of Tan Xiuyi to not guilty. At this time, Tan Xiuyi had been &quot;released&quot; two months ago and had been imprisoned for more than 29 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trial process of this case is full of doubts. The case occurred in 1993, but the first-instance verdict was issued more than six years later, and the second-instance verdict was found to be &quot;unclear.&quot; It can be inferred that the investigation process of the case was not smooth and the evidence based on which the case was decided was not sufficient. In this regard, the criminal protest letter of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate also stated: In this case, except for Tan Xiuyi&#39;s partial guilty confession, which is consistent with the investigation transcripts and autopsy reports, there is no objective evidence to prove that Tan Xiuyi committed the crime; for the crime of rape, the time of Tan Xiuyi&#39;s rape cannot be determined, and the rape behavior It is also impossible to prove; regarding the crime of intentional homicide, some of the crime tools are unclear and the conclusions of criminal technical appraisal are not unique. In addition, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate also found that Tan Xiuyi&#39;s several guilty confessions were inconsistent and contradicted other evidence. The Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate believes that the case also contains problems such as guilty confessions and interrogation transcripts that violate legal provisions and whose authenticity is questionable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the evidence in the case basically only consists of Tan Xiuyi’s confession, and there is no objective evidence. Even the authenticity of the confession is doubtful, and the confession may have been illegally coerced. During the second trial, the Henan High Court determined that the facts of the case were unclear and remanded the case for retrial. It can be seen that the second instance also believed that there were problems with the evidence. However, it took just over a year for the retrial to reach another verdict, which not only upheld the crime of intentional homicide, but also added the crime of rape (this is also a doubtful point: since Tan Xiuyi was found to have raped Tan Hong in the first trial in 1999, why was he not punished? Convicted of rape?), and the retrial second instance also upheld the first instance judgment of the retrial. It took six years to obtain enough evidence, but why did it take just over a year to add new evidence that was sufficient to establish the crime? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not to mention that homicide cases require sufficient evidence to be determined, rape cases only rely on oral confessions, which is difficult to understand. Regardless of whether it was forced, at least it must be proven that there was sexual intercourse between the victim and the suspect. Although the victim was dead, the rape and murder were only a few hours apart. At that time, the police also mastered DNA comparison technology. Through forensic identification, it was completely possible to find out whether the victim had had sex with the suspect before his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did the Henan Provincial High Court find that the facts were unclear in the initial second instance, but the second instance of the retrial, as well as the subsequent appeal, all believed that &quot;the facts were clearly found and the evidence was indeed sufficient&quot;? Are the judges who handle retrials, second trials and appeals under pressure from other parties? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case occurred in 1993, and many trials were held around 2000. Although the Internet was not very developed at that time, a major extermination case that killed a family of three still had a very large impact, and the public prosecutor and the law were bound to be under considerable pressure. What is particularly noteworthy is that Henan was one of the first provinces to propose &quot;murder cases must be solved&quot; at the beginning of this century. In 2004, it was recognized by the Ministry of Public Security as a national slogan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 National People’s Congress, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate stated in a report that in the past five years, 26 major criminal wrongful convictions, including the Wuzhou case and the Zhang Yuhuan case, had been corrected in accordance with the law; Protests or prosecutorial recommendations for retrials were made in 10 major unjust cases in which the original verdict lasted for more than ten years, and the court changed the verdict to not guilty in all cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these unjust, false and wrong cases, in addition to redressing the grievances and compensating the parties concerned, should the investigators at the time also bear responsibility? In 2013, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission issued guidance on effectively preventing unjust, false and wrongful convictions, requiring judges, prosecutors, and people&#39;s police to be lifelong responsible for the quality of case handling within the scope of their duties, and to establish and improve the accountability mechanism for unjust, false and wrongly convicted cases. In 2021, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, Zhang Jun, once stated that at the beginning of 2021, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate launched a comprehensive investigation into the cases of correction of wrongful convictions since 2018, and has listed and supervised 22 cases of wrongful convictions that were wrongly detained for more than 10 years, and all of them have proposed serious accountability. Opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate put forward, &quot;Correction cannot stop at state compensation, and accountability must fall on the responsible party.&quot; Correcting unjust, false and wrong cases cannot stop at overturned cases and compensation, so that there is a sense of justice in the investigation and trial process of the case. Only when responsible personnel take responsibility can judicial fairness and justice be demonstrated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[换个角度看大学]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257347]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Why does school start on September 1st?

A large &quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; roll-up banner divided the space into two, and a media conducted an interview, asking Lin Jiadong about the cooperation between &quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; and the director and starring actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because the appointment took the longest, my interview was scheduled as the last one of the day. I&#39;m worried that he will be tired after the intensive announcements during the promotion period, or his desire to express will weaken (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is very normal&lt;/span>;). but no. When the staff and I walked around the roll-up banners, Lin Jiadong turned to look out the floor-to-ceiling window, looking very interested. Outside is the night view of Beijing&#39;s Third Ring Road. There are office buildings with lights on in the darkness, which may be very similar to Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He likes to observe other people&#39;s lives. He said that he likes to sit in a tea restaurant and listen to people gossiping - he imitates how guests and waiters shout in a tea restaurant where people are crowded around tables. He said that if others looked at him, he would look back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lin Jiadong, I saw what a good actor looks like. He is not particularly handsome, but the environment in which he lives allows for diverse creations. There is no need to have the appearance of an idol, and there is no need to expose a lot of private life. As a profession, the life of an actor can really be very long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that there is no age anxiety in him. When he played a supporting role in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; 21 years ago, he was already in his thirties (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;he was born in 1967&lt;/span>;), Abandoned the stable path of starring in TVB. Later, he said that it was unbearable to film so many TV series in a year. He has played golden supporting roles in many movies, such as two &quot;Underworld&quot; and &quot;Exile&quot;, &quot;Ip Man&quot;, and &quot;Chill&quot;. He has built a solid foundation step by step. In past interviews, he has always said that he is a boring and boring person. Apart from acting, he rarely talks about his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It would be better to end this article with a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the appointed time, the interview was coming to an end. After asking the last question, I couldn’t help but ask how they rehearsed the positioning of the long shot in &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a work in which Jack Lam starred for free and supported new Hong Kong directors. He plays Guan Chao, a former Chinese-American British soldier who is completely unsuitable for the new era. There is a nearly 10-minute long shot at the end of &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot;, which is extremely exciting. The camera looks far away on the rooftop. The gangster Guan Chao worked for before discovered that his betrayal was not just about money, but also hiding the person who stole the gangster&#39;s goods worth tens of millions. Extreme violence occurs in this long shot, where Guan Chao is beaten by a group of thugs. Everyone&#39;s fight was not good-looking, using brute force and deadly strikes. Guan Chao got into a scuffle with someone and was beaten badly. He stumbled from one room to another and was beaten violently by two people from the other party he had offended. He was already dying (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The camera recorded Guan Chao&#39;s death in real time&lt;/span>;), Guan Chao used his last bit of strength to rush to the camera , and immersed the person who was lying on top of him to restrain him into the water tank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our action director arranged it first. His martial arts actor did it once. He filmed it and cut it out for me to see. He said, can you do it like this? I remember at that time I said, Director , I’m not young anymore.” Lin Jiadong smiled and repeated, and the director said, “You can do it, Jiadong!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Okay. Lin Jiadong watched the long shot twice, and everyone rehearsed it twice more. The shooting started. When he shot the first shot, his eye was injured. He went to the hospital and came back to continue filming. He happily recalled the scene at the end of the long scene where Guan Chao dragged the person to the water tank and submerged him. It was very enjoyable. &quot;For this character, he only has these 10 seconds in his life (to fight back like this). That should be his response to life.&quot; Roaring.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我放弃改造“扫兴”父母：“人教人很难，事教人一次就会”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257398]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;When we were young, our parents took us to know the world; when we grow up, we also hope to take our parents to see the world. But our parents’ response often disappoints us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I take them on a trip, they mumble along the way, saying, &quot;You spend money to find trouble.&quot; When you take them to enjoy delicious food, they say, &quot;It&#39;s not as good as the food at home.&quot; You buy them down jackets and furs. A coat, they say, is &quot;not as light and warm as a cotton-padded jacket&quot;... Every time I happily do this or that for my parents, I always get thrown cold water on it, which makes me feel annoyed. Sometimes I will show it out and quarrel with my parents, saying, &quot;The dog bites me.&quot; Lu Dongbin——I don’t know the good heart.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the discussion on the Internet about &quot;parents who are not a spoiler&quot; has attracted a lot of attention. The negative example is my parents. The positive teaching material is to happily accept the kindness of their children, and their children will take them to eat. Enjoy it and say &quot;It&#39;s delicious.&quot; When your children buy clothes for them, they put them on immediately and say &quot;It looks good.&quot; Your children order takeout and happily follow it to taste... Some people even pull their parents to &quot;swear&quot; before taking their parents shopping: &quot;I am determined not to waste money, I am determined not to spend money to find trouble, and I am determined not to eat junk food again...&quot; I feel very sad! So I forwarded these short videos to my mother to see, hoping that she would change. She immediately said, &quot;You have to pretend to like it even if you don&#39;t like it?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I really had nothing to say. I have to admit that she is right. Rational analysis shows that these short videos, on the one hand, capture the emotions of adult children who are disappointed by their parents; on the other hand, for the sake of traffic, they create an image of &quot;parents who are not disappointed&quot; and please the adult children who occupy the mainstream of the Internet population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is indeed a generation gap between us and our parents. First of all, we have different growth backgrounds and different views on money. My parents’ generation experienced an era of insufficient material wealth, so they are very frugal. Although many people have pensions that exceed their adult children’s salary and have less expenses, they are still reluctant to spend money. As my mother’s famous saying “Saving money is the key to saving money” My greatest pleasure.” In this way, we can understand why uncles and aunts are willing to line up for two hours to receive 10 eggs, and why old people who live in high-end communities are keen to collect scraps and sell them, not only because they have free time, but also because they are used to being frugal. What&#39;s more, the characteristics of their generation have been accurately grasped by scammers, and they often succeed under the guise of &quot;free&quot;. I once advised my mother not to fill in personal information in order to receive the free small fans, small mirrors, and low-quality tissues, so as not to receive countless phone calls or even encounter telecom fraud. But she firmly believed: &quot;It&#39;s free, don&#39;t give it up!&quot; &quot;I just Without spending money, what can he deceive me about?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the behavior of our parents to discourage us is due to their different views on money. Our generation has become accustomed to buying houses with loans, spending with credit cards, and spending money on spending money. &quot;Baitiao&quot;, look for housekeeping and cleaning, and be more frugal, earn ten yuan and spend five yuan... As long as you are comfortable and happy, you should spend money. But they would rather walk five streets under the scorching sun than spend two yuan to take a bus. They can spend two hours taking a bus and wander slowly, so they won&#39;t spend 10 minutes taking a taxi to get there. Therefore, the essence of their disincentive to us is that they are afraid that we will spend money, because we are one family with them. They have experienced a period of material scarcity, have richer life experiences, and understand the ups and downs of life better. They often say that &quot;a penny can stump a hero&quot;, &quot;a long stream of water will keep you from worrying when encountering disasters&quot;, &quot;thinking ahead and looking ahead, you will always have food and clothing&quot; &quot;If you don&#39;t have enough food, you won&#39;t have enough clothes. If you don&#39;t calculate, you will be poor.&quot; &quot;Three years for the new, three years for the old, and three more years for mending.&quot; They save money not only out of habit, but also to fully support us when needed. , let us borrow less when buying a house, pay less every month, and have more money...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two generations have different views on money, and it is difficult to distinguish the pros and cons. Although my mother is also aware of the benefits brought by another consumption concept, it is still difficult to overcome the hurdle in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about the changes in our generation&#39;s consumption outlook. It has gone through almost twenty years. From college, we started accepting credit cards, mobile payments, and e-commerce. After working, we started to make rapid progress, buying, buying, buying, and now live broadcasting. After grabbing time, we began to reflect again, burst the consumption bubble, and became more rational... Now we force our parents&#39; generation to immediately keep up with our pace and support our consumption concept 100%. It is really unrealistic. The transformation of parents also needs to be done step by step. We have stepped on the consumption &quot;pits&quot; that we have stepped on before, bought a bunch of cheap and unused small items, been deceived several times, returned the goods several times, and been injured several times. Only then can the mind slowly become enlightened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother rented out the house and persuaded her to install new furniture. She was not willing to spend money, so she moved the &quot;old antiques&quot; that were no longer needed at home to the rental house. She was not fashionable at all. As a result, many tenants came and did not It looks like it has never been rented out. So, she asked someone to move the &quot;old antiques&quot; and install new furniture. Moving around, owing favors, and delaying renting, I indirectly lost a lot of money, which was far more than the money for new furniture. &quot;It&#39;s hard to teach others, but you can teach them everything once.&quot; She was convinced after he calculated the economic accounts for her through his words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days ago, I saw in my circle of friends that they were going on a &quot;travel&quot;. The so-called &quot;travel&quot; meant visiting various towns and villages under the jurisdiction of our county. They happily told me that due to preferential policies, local residents over sixty years old can ride the bus for free. If they bring a bottle of boiled water and two boiled eggs, they can go out for a day without spending a penny. I suddenly realized that for us, Lijiang, Xinjiang, Tibet, Maldives, and Iceland are poetry and distance, but for them, the surrounding towns and villages are their poetry and distance, and this is a travel experience that is more suitable for their &quot;physical constitution.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our parents grew up with us and took the trouble to teach us to understand and experience small things one by one. As we grow older with our parents, we must also change our mentality, stop being harsh, and patiently accompany our parents to &quot;grow&quot; together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then on, I gave up trying to reform my &quot;disappointing&quot; parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a middle school teacher in Tianjin)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.
