The champion was 26-year-old Zhang Zhizhen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Asian Games championship, he has the highest ATP singles ranking of 52nd in the world. He has reached the top 8 of the Madrid Masters and the top 32 of the French Open and the US Open. These are all mainland Chinese men. The best result of the net. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last person to win the Asian Games men&#39;s singles tennis gold medal was Pan Bing. He won the 1990 Beijing Asian Games and won the title again at the Hiroshima Asian Games four years later. After 1990, China&#39;s women&#39;s tennis rose and gradually established its dominance in the Asian Games. However, China&#39;s men&#39;s tennis developed slowly. It was not until the last Asian Games, when 19-year-old Wu Yibing unexpectedly reached the finals and finally won the silver medal that the Chinese men&#39;s tennis team returned to the Asian Games finals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Zhizhen and Wu Yibing are both currently in the top 100 in the world in ATP rankings, and are the No. 1 and No. 3 seeds respectively in this Asian Games. After Wu Yibing stopped in the top eight, Zhang Zhizhen became the only one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/MqUATwgWZ1DluNirRdL5ZDvoKXM2pklSecNsA5fj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;609&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/MqUATwgWZ1DluNirRdL5ZDvoKXM2pklSecNsA5fj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252886&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 30, 2023, Zhang Zhizhen returned the ball during the game&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The situation in the first five games was surprising. Judging from Zhang Zhizhen&#39;s expressions and movements, he was a little emotional and was not focused enough on the ball. The serve was broken in the first game and she made 4 double-serve errors. Zhan Jun and many other commentators believed that perhaps there was too much interference in the stands, and Zhang Zhizhen was unable to quickly enter the game state and played a bit casually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also true that live broadcasts frequently broadcast: Please keep quiet, thank you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the sixth set of the first game, Zhang Zhizhen entered the state, kept serve, and then chased five consecutive games. Twisted from 1:4 to 6:4. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first set of the second game, Zhang Zhizhen scored 4 consecutive serves, with a 100% first-serve success rate. At the end of the seventh set, after Zhang Zhizhen led 4:3, he called an injury timeout and asked the caregiver to massage his waist. Subsequently, Yosuke Watanuki did not make many moves in the service game and gave up one game. After 4:4, Zhang Zhizhen scored 4 points in a row, held serve, and led 5:4. After that, the two sides guaranteed each other&#39;s serve and dragged the game into a tie-break. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both sides clung to the score in the tiebreaker, dragging it all the way to 7:7. On Zhang Zhizhen&#39;s third match point, Yosuke Watanuki hit the ball out of bounds, and Zhang Zhizhen won the 19th Asian Games men&#39;s singles tennis championship. He threw his wristband and ball to the audience and walked around the court wearing a national flag. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Serving is Zhang Zhizhen’s biggest advantage. He is also considered to have the best physical fitness among all Chinese men’s tennis players in the past. Zhang Zhizhen is 193cm tall and is considered a big man among tennis players. A big man is more likely to be a good serve, which he himself knows. He once said, &quot;The serve should be my biggest weapon, but sometimes my serve is still not on line, and sometimes the success rate of my first serve is suddenly very small. So I still I want to improve my serving skills and reduce first-serve errors, which is very important to me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/09/30/b00vwFWYnoAXklNCqnIsIh6W1mzAxUlM64O2SoR5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;611&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09 /30/b00vwFWYnoAXklNCqnIsIh6W1mzAxUlM64O2SoR5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252889&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 30, 2023, Zhang Zhizhen (left) and Mian Yosuke Guan shakes hands after the game &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;26-year-old Zhang Zhizhen started playing tennis at the age of 4 and entered Xuhui at the age of 10 District team, and entered the Shanghai team at the age of 12. His father was a professional tennis player and his mother was a shooter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The year Zhang Zhizhen was selected for the Shanghai team, a huge change occurred in the Chinese tennis world: the Network Management Center allowed four athletes including Li Na, Zheng Jie, and Yan Zi to &quot;fly solo&quot;. This move was considered to be the professionalization of my country&#39;s tennis. The &quot;ice-breaking move&quot; on the road has thus formed the current dual-track management model of the Chinese tennis team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After joining the Shanghai team, Zhang Zhizhen was sent to Nice, France for training. He has partnered with Daniil Medvedev to participate in ITF Hope Tournaments around the world, and also won the men&#39;s doubles runner-up in the Hope Tournament. Nine years later, Medvedev won the Australian Open runner-up for the second time and rose to No. 1 in the ATP rankings, becoming the first young man to end the 18-year monopoly of the &quot;Big Four&quot; on the world&#39;s No. 1 ranking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this moment, the China Tennis Open restarts after four years. Medvedev is participating in the China Open in Beijing, and Nishioka Yoshihito, the currently highest-ranked Asian player in the ATP ranking and the 2014 Asian Games champion, also chose the latter between the Asian Games and the China Open. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Zhizhen did not play much in youth competitions, with his highest ranking being 166th. In 2012, Zhang Zhizhen, who was not yet 16 years old, entered professional tennis. For the next four years, his performance stalled. The general manager of Zhang Zhizhen&#39;s Shanghai Pudong Tennis Team analyzed in an interview with the media that he has been stuck in the same place for four years, which is a mistake made by the club management. Firstly, he turned professional too early and did not realize that he, who was still in the developmental stage, would suffer injuries after playing consecutive adult games; secondly, he did not allow family members to accompany him during long-term overseas training. “A child abroad is very lonely. Yes, we failed to communicate in time and failed to accompany him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Zhizhen also believed that he turned professional too early. He turned professional just after winning the Hope Games. &quot;Actually, you can play more youth games to build up confidence, but if you keep losing, it would be a miserable loss.&quot; Zhang Zhizhen said, &quot;Although I play games every week, I lose every week. This feeling is very bad. . Only when you win more games will you feel it and be in good shape.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that it was not until 2015 that he achieved good results in the Asian season: he won his first career tour victory, and then After winning the TOP100 for the first time in his career, he felt that he could really play tennis for a lifetime. &quot;It was only then that I felt I had the ability to compete with them, and then I got there step by step.&quot; But at the end of that year, Zhang Zhizhen suffered a fracture in his left foot and had to undergo surgery after two months of conservative treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Zhizhen is a player who understands setbacks very well. When asked about past losses, he would laugh a few times and then answer candidly. After entering the top 100 of the ATP rankings - he is the first mainland male tennis player to enter the top 100 of the ATP - he has experienced repeated defeats for half a year. He admitted that at that time his mentality was very low, as long as he could win a set. But most of the time, he was a one-rounder. He thought maybe because he played less games, he had less control over the field. He also encountered a similar dilemma when he first turned professional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The state in that half year was very bad, and I don&#39;t know what happened. The state in that half year was completely different from now. The state at that time was very poor, no matter how hard I played, I couldn&#39;t.&quot; Zhang Zhizhen in 2023 Xia Tian recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/2uJidZhmCML30aNGVyGRadlQFyqSOWPELy9h3z9J.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/2uJidZhmCML30aNGVyGRadlQFyqSOWPELy9h3z9J.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252890&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 4, 2023, in the men&#39;s singles quarter-finals of the 2023 Madrid Tennis Open, Chinese player Zhang Zhizhen lost to Russian player Karatsev 0-2. Stopped in the top eight &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is obviously a good year. Zhang Zhizhen reached the top 8 of the Madrid Masters and the top 32 of the French Open and the US Open. Many people asked him why his mentality was completely different from before. He won many five-set matches. His answer was quite candid and meaningful: “After losing so many games, your heart will actually become calmer. You will feel nervous or something.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He lost to Roode, a top 10 player in the ATP rankings, at the French Open, and eliminated Roode at the US Open four months later. Before the US Open match, he studied Ruud&#39;s hard court and training videos, and also rewatched his game with Ruud. He felt that he had a chance. &quot;Last time, it completely impacted his mentality. He was more panicked. This time, he felt more like there was a chance to compete and he was not so anxious.&quot; He knew that the key to victory was concentration. &quot;The second half of last time I have concerns about physical fitness and power, but not this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/uViYg8Gq3wWo3PwlN7Ycovs4MDiLDmiWtWQw0yMN .jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;727&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/uViYg8Gq3wWo3PwlN7Ycovs4MDiLDmiWtWQw0yMN.jpg&quot; data-key =&quot;252888&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 30, 2023, Zhang Zhizhen celebrated after winning the championship&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He returned to China with the top 32 results of the US Open and bluntly stated that his goal in the Asian Games is to win gold. This is completely different from the mentality a year ago where I just wanted to win a round. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, as long as Zhang Zhizhen regains his form, he will play better and better. Once you start winning, it&#39;s like a tiebreaker. &quot;Win a few games and your form will come back.&quot; Zhang Zhizhen said, &quot;Maybe you&#39;ll be lucky enough to keep winning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is a competitive player. The game is exciting. The night before the Madrid Masters against Fritz (ranked top 10 in the world), he slept only four hours and made up for two more hours during the day. &quot;I&#39;m very excited, and with the jet lag, the adrenaline hormones can&#39;t come down at all.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the Hangzhou Asian Games victory, Zhang Zhizhen has already won a ticket to the 2024 Paris Olympics. He and the entire Chinese men&#39;s network are ushering in the best era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview before the Asian Games, when asked about the happiest moment in 2023, Zhang Zhizhen replied without thinking: &quot;Deng Ziqi replied to my Weibo!&quot; He said that tennis results can be better in the future, but The singer you like can reply only once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 4, 2023, Zhang Zhizhen bid farewell to the Madrid Masters with a top 8 result. This is the first time that a Chinese male tennis player has reached the top 8 of the Masters. He posted a Weibo post with Deng Ziqi&#39;s lyrics: &quot;The sky has no limit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Your future is boundless.&quot; Deng Ziqi replied with the next sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[竞业限制是否阻碍劳动力自由流动？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257794]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 20:39:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the labor market, from small factories and workshops to large listed companies, they are all faced with the contradiction between cultivating employees and establishing competitors. . This leads to companies either being hesitant to teach the true scriptures or putting forward unreasonable restrictions when cultivating employees to pass on their skills. The reality is often a combination of both. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Non-compete restrictions, which originated from British common law, solve this problem very well: the company signs a contract with employees, and when employees leave, the company has the right to limit their employment options to eliminate competition risks. Such restrictions are conditional, and competition only applies to a certain period of time, specific regions and industries. Most importantly, money needs to be spent to compensate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Non-compete is an agreement outside the labor contract, and the company has to pay the cost, so it is not common at first. The provisions are activated only when technical secrets are a key factor in competition and only to a small number of people. Non-compete restrictions may seem to restrict employees&#39; right to choose employment, but considering that it is a free agreement and employees receive additional money, the law protects the validity of such contracts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Restrictions on non-compete are a common phenomenon in the modern workplace. As the largest common law country, the United States would accept it happily. However, there is a strong &quot;trust phobia&quot; in American society. Such contracts are considered to restrict labor mobility and eliminate corporate competition. Therefore, not only the blue states dominated by the Democratic Party prohibit non-competition contracts, but also the law in Republican states such as Florida. Prefer prohibition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Competition contracts are a spontaneous product of the market. Explicitly prohibiting them cannot solve the dilemma of &quot;teaching apprentices and starving masters&quot;, and is actually not conducive to the free movement of workers. In order to eliminate the competitive threat after employees leave, the company will keep an eye on current employees and set up a long deconfidential period. Employees are required to sign a separate confidentiality agreement, which remains in effect even after leaving the company. Large companies have reached a tacit agreement not to &quot;poach&quot; each other. These measures not only increase uncertainty in the workplace, but also hinder the free movement of workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We originally did not have a culture of non-competition. This system was introduced from the West, recognized by law, and widely accepted. Non-competes are cost-bearing for the company, so they are usually only available to company executives or in certain industries. Contrary to the United States, non-competition restrictions in Chinese workplaces have not declined in recent years, but have increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the emerging Internet and electric vehicle industries, there are hundreds of companies whose employees are prohibited from re-employing, including peer companies, upstream and downstream suppliers and sellers. At first, only senior executives or key talents were allowed to compete for jobs, but now it has become a standard requirement for employees to join the company. &quot;No one is not competing for jobs, and competition is everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, for insignificant personnel movements, non-competition restrictions are just threats, and the company will not really stop them. As for the job-hopping of employees that the company values, they will start based on the situation. Some give money directly, while others wait and see and delay, giving a fatal blow to resigned employees at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of topic is often seen on workplace forums: After resigning from the company, the company has not discussed non-competition compensation. Can I still join a competing company? Some people gave a positive opinion. Since there is no non-competition compensation and the agreement is not effective, there should be no non-competition. At this time, people who have experienced it often give bloody advice: Don&#39;t step on the line easily, because the company may launch a surprise attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 23 of the &quot;Labor Contract Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;the employer may agree with the employee on non-competition clauses in the labor contract or confidentiality agreement, and agree on the rescission or termination of the labor contract.&quot; Afterwards, workers will be given financial compensation on a monthly basis during the non-competition period.&quot; The so-called &quot;can be agreed upon&quot; is not only due to the autonomy of will, but also lays the foundation for non-competition disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The length of the non-competition restriction, the amount of compensation, and the labor contract law are not stipulated, but are clarified through judicial interpretations-if the contract is unclear, the longest period shall not exceed two years, and the average monthly amount shall not exceed Less than one-third of the original salary. There are no relevant regulations on the amount of employee default, which falls within the category of &quot;agreement&quot;. When employees draft non-compete agreements, they tend to increase the amount of liquidated damages. For positions with a monthly salary of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, the liquidated damages are often as high as tens or even millions, a figure that is daunting to employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When should the company pay compensation? The judicial interpretation states: If the employer fails to pay non-compete compensation for three months and the employee requests to terminate the non-compete agreement, the people&#39;s court shall support it. It seems that it is only valid for three months, but it is not. The company had not paid for three months, and the non-competition restriction was actually still in effect—the requirement for its invalidity was that the workers petitioned for relief, the court ruled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reality is usually that once the company receives a request (through notification, labor arbitration or lawsuit) and the former employee wants to lift the non-compete restriction, the company responds calmly. If employees do not pose a competitive threat, the company will compensate them with up to 30% of their wages for three months and lift non-competition restrictions. If employees intend to join a competing company or join a competing company, they can directly remit a sum of money to the other party&#39;s account to initiate a block or claim. Judicial practice shows that at this time, the court tends to believe that the company is performing non-competition compensation and the non-competition restriction is activated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Contemporary non-competition restrictions mean that after employees leave their jobs, they cease to work and no longer join their peers, leaving the company with nothing to do. Once an employee believes that the agreement is not in effect, the onboarding constitutes a breach of contract and the company can launch an attack. With a small payment, the agreement is activated and the employee becomes involved in a &quot;competition trap.&quot; Not only is the new job not guaranteed, but a large amount of liquidated damages will also be paid. The company has full control over how it operates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of low-cost, high-return non-competition restriction is obviously beneficial to the company. This is the fundamental reason for the increase in non-competition restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution is simple, rebalancing the interests of both parties in the non-competition restriction. There should be an upper limit on the amount of an employee&#39;s breach of contract. The scope of non-competition restrictions should also be made clear - limited to a few competitors, rather than spreading all over the place. The activation of the non-competition agreement and the payment of compensation also need to be clarified. Both the company and its employees must draw clear boundaries in their relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In labor relations, the law needs to eliminate uncertainty and reduce conflicts. The increase in competition in China&#39;s workplace is creating privileges for companies and hindering the free flow of labor. The law should fill in the workplace traps caused by non-competition restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[导演王沐和他的“温柔壳”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257431]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/usCUxK3jSw78IL72kOF9sxCcVvD7D28475aHpO19.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/usCUxK3jSw78IL72kOF9sxCcVvD 7D28475aHpO19. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251384&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Not to be watched&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On June 11, 2023, during the Shanghai International Film Festival, director Wang Mu arrived at the cafe we ​​agreed on nearly an hour early, and happened to be in There was a queue behind me for coffee. His directorial debut &quot;The Gentle Shell&quot; was released in theaters across the country at the end of May. It was in theaters for 10 days and grossed more than 12 million yuan at the box office. This result is incomparable with the commercial films that became popular in the summer and often grossed billions at the box office, but as a small- to medium-cost literary film, the performance is really good. On August 2, &quot;Gentle Shell&quot; was released on streaming media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Preparations for the film began in 2018. Wang Mu has been to four mental rehabilitation institutions and had in-depth conversations with many friends who have emotional problems. In the final film, social issues became the background, and he focused on the emotions of two people -&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The girl Juexiao could not accept her mother&#39;s departure and kept searching. She suffered a mental breakdown and even committed suicide by cutting her wrists (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Attempt&lt;/span>;); The boy Dai Chun suffers from bipolar disorder. His father is an alcoholic, has left home, and is suffering from dementia in old age. Dai Chun and Jue Xiao, who were at a low point in their lives, met in a mental rehabilitation center. The two people, who had not been listened to or understood before, hugged each other for warmth in a closed environment and built a &quot;gentle shell&quot; to comfort their mental pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-June, the film’s promotion work came to an end. &quot;Too many people&#39;s attention makes me feel stressed.&quot; Wang Mu said with a smile. He is not a talkative creator. Regarding questions such as &quot;Has the director&#39;s debut experience accumulated experience for subsequent screenwriting and directing work?&quot; and &quot;Do you usually read books with a theme?&quot;, he answered &quot;yes&quot;, nodded, and then fell into silence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Mu was doing drama more than ten years ago, and his first play was performed in Chaoyang Jiu Theater. Since he couldn&#39;t find an actor, he played the role himself. On the stage, all he felt was darkness, and he couldn&#39;t see the audience. It was raining outside, seeping from the theater ceiling to the stage. In my memory, it looked like a water curtain hole. Wang Mu added an impromptu line, &quot;Look how rainy it is.&quot; The audience immediately responded with applause, and he caught what would have been a stage mishap. In the second game, more spectators and media came to attend, and two more rows of seats were added in front of the first row of seats. As soon as Wang Mu came on stage and saw &quot;so many viewers suddenly attracted&quot;, he realized that he was being watched and never went on stage again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He doesn&#39;t want to be watched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the COVID-19 epidemic has passed, road shows seem to have become very important whenever a movie is released. It has become a routine operation for the main creative staff to go to various cities to participate in post-screening activities of various movie fan viewing groups. Wang Mu and his &quot;Gentle Shell&quot; are no exception. It was okay, he said, at least we were talking about movies. As for the fashion magazine trend of dressing directors in branded clothes and taking photos in absurd man-made landscapes, he still doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It took me two years to write and rewrite the script. When he had further ideas for the script, he suddenly felt something in his heart and wrote a 7,000-word letter to Jue Xiao and Dai Chun in his home study, writing about his feelings for them and about himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What is it about,&quot; I asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My colleagues in publicity also asked me if I wanted to post it. I didn’t post it because I felt that it belonged to Dai Chunjuexiao at that time. From the bottom of my heart, I didn’t want people to know what I wrote.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In 2023, Wang Mu is 36 years old. A movie of his own is released and the response is good. What next? He wasn&#39;t sure. During the interview, he said several times that he would like to try to make commercial films in the future, so that the core of what he wants to express can reach the public in a more popular way. This is actually very difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago or more, Wang Mu thought about his ambition to be a professional screenwriter and strive to be the best? Is there still a chance to be a director? It seems like neither. When he was in his twenties or thirties, he thought, it would be great if he could be a person like Acheng. &quot;Study aesthetics when you want to study aesthetics, and write things when you want to. You can write scripts for other directors, but you don&#39;t have to think about any remuneration, you don&#39;t have to think about contracts, you don&#39;t have to meet with people every day, and you don&#39;t care much about reviews, or I care too much about the so-called award results, as if that state is particularly good. I live in a very free and willful state.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I can&#39;t do it. No one can do it, and there is no need for such people in this era, he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/MRHCGedYwYR2Mo7k4hGzUzRnJsHBxiWpjTqZGgrX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1707&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/MRHCGedYwYR2Mo7k4hGzUzRnJsHBxiWpjTqZGgrX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;Gentle Shell&quot;, Wang Ziwen and Yin Fang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;Consensus and Resonance&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Unlike many young directors, Wang Mu is not a cinephile, nor a believer of the New Wave or a certain film master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before taking the theater exam, he had no habit of watching movies. The first movie he actively watched in his life was &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;. He bought a pirated disc and watched it in a small hotel room. Antoine &quot;enshrined Balzac like a shrine&quot;, and this child in France in the 1950s seemed to be a reflection of his inner world. The movie ends abruptly when Antoine leaves home, and Wang Mu is greatly shocked. &quot;I still can&#39;t forget that touching feeling. It&#39;s an unprecedented feeling. It&#39;s very wonderful. It turns out that this is what the movie is like.&quot; After going to college, he watched &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; again at a classmate&#39;s house, only to find that the disc he had bought had an error in the recording. Without the famous long shot of Antoine running in film history, it would be different from the movie that shocked him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I know in my heart that movies are only a part of life, and part of what I want to express will still be put on the stage.&quot; Wang Mu said that his biggest wish is to continue reading dramas in this life. . He has also been writing, sometimes as fragments, sometimes as notes, without sticking to a strict framework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Mu did well in Chinese in middle school, but he didn’t understand why writing a composition should have a definite central idea. The first scene of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; was selected in the Chinese textbook - Wang Mu didn&#39;t know who the two characters were waiting for, and the two characters themselves might not know. Is they waiting for hope, death, or some other end? The ambiguous interpretation space and endless implication struck him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Write even if you read too much. He later revised and re-wrote a play he wrote in high school. It was staged in 2007 and performed twice in Beijing. The core of the play is a bit like &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, the protagonist is also waiting for something. That year, Wang Mu was 20 years old. He was fascinated by the chemistry in the theater. The stage was set up before the performance and dismantled after the performance. He sat alone in the audience for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While working in the drama industry until 2010, Wang Mu only rehearsed that one play. He did not go into details about that experience, but he probably mentioned that it was not easy to do theater in Beijing, and that one had to endure poverty and accept the trap culture. &quot;Later on, I slowly got into movies. For work, I wrote scripts for others. When I got tired of writing one movie after another, I decided that I still wanted to make a movie myself, and that&#39;s where I am today.&quot; He concluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, a friend introduced him to a man named Li Xiaofeng. Li Xiaofeng read two novels written by Wang Mu. They were realistic, special in tone, and solemn in rhythm. Their literary skills left an impression on him. After getting acquainted, Li Xiaofeng learned that Wang Mu liked Chekhov the most. He went to Wang Mu&#39;s house and saw a heavy bust of Lu Xun placed on the desk. &quot;He is a very serious creator at heart.&quot; Li Xiaofeng commented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng said he wanted to make a movie, so he handed over the Green Demon&#39;s novel &quot;Girl Nezha&quot; and asked Wang Mu if he thought it could be made. The novel tells the adolescent worries of two girls in Baocheng in the form of letters. In Li Xiaofeng&#39;s memory, almost everyone around him opposed the revision of the novel and found it difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Mu said at the time, yes. Looking back now, Wang Mu said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m not sure he can do it, but since he wants to shoot, I will at least have an income.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng emphasized that the creator must have a lot of personality and personality. Mutual trust is needed in terms of talent. &quot;Thinking about the world, love for people, and views on people in life&quot; are more important than agreement on specific creations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first draft of the script of &quot;Girl Nezha&quot; was written by Wang Mu, which &quot;brought the best foundation.&quot; Li Xiaofeng commented that there were not many details in the original work that could be used for film shooting, and Wang Mu Mu&#39;s script &quot;draws out all the characters&#39; dynamics of the two girls, very realistically.&quot; After that, another screenwriter Pan Yu joined and wrote another draft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Movies are supposed to be collective creations, but they happen to be not. &quot;This draft of the script was written by Wang Mu, and it is Wang Mu&#39;s characteristics. The next draft will have the characteristics of others. We will not necessarily discuss, quarrel, and finally reach an agreement. What is very important to me is that the movie is not about Twist everyone together and unify them into a certain specific pursuit, but let the light and brightness of these creators shine through their own work, and try to draw on each other&#39;s strengths as much as possible. This is the method I like.&quot; Li Xiaofeng said , they were young at that time, twenty-four or five years old, creative but not immature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last film &quot;Girl Nezha&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2015&lt;/span>;) was nominated for the Best of the 51st Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival Adapted Screenplay Award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You have to believe in the power of free creation. It may not be stable, but it will keep your body and mind healthy.” Li Xiaofeng said. He and Wang Mu also collaborated on &quot;Rebirth from the Ashes&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2017&lt;/span>;), about the impact of a murder case on two men many years later. Lasting impact. When the script reached the seventh draft, Wang Mu joined in, making it more literary. The collaborators have a consensus that they want to use the film to describe the state of the individual after &quot;all solid things have disappeared&quot; in fictional time and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this industry that relies on seniority and charlatanism, Wang Mu described the congeniality between creators as unquantifiable as possible, &quot;He may feel some kind of sincerity in you. Or he will let you write the parts he needs.&quot; The directors who come into contact with him do not measure the screenwriter&#39;s ability by awards or box office, and they do not require that the script must be written like a script. Some people say that you can write novels. Another director allowed him to write the outline as a diary. &quot;It must be in a comfortable context,&quot; Wang Mu emphasized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Everyone will continue to move forward on his own creative path. We are different creators, but we can have a good consensus or resonance at the intersection of time and space. , I think it is very precious.&quot; Li Xiaofeng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng still remembers that &quot;Girl Nezha&quot; participated in the venture capital film festival for the first time, and Wang Mu drafted the outline. At that time, Li Xiaofeng had not yet become a director. Before giving a PPT lecture, in the office, Wang Mu gave Li Xiaofeng advice like a drama director giving a lecture to an actor: Director, I think you should give a speech like this. Li Xiaofeng didn&#39;t remember the specific suggestions, but he remembered the status of the two of them very clearly, &quot;There is no distinction between positions. It is the creator and the creator who are together. This feeling is quite rare today.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A movie of one&#39;s own&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the film &quot;Galaxy Writer&quot; won the Best Screenplay Award at the FIRST Youth Film Festival, vividly showing the screenwriter as a &quot;service industry&quot; (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Lines in the film&lt;/span>;) The dilemma of practitioners: I am lucky enough to be favored by the producer, and I keep having meetings. Change, add roles, change people; the producer talks, the director talks, the investors talk; every link is tortured, and finally it returns to the starting point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Mu said that she used to not be the kind of professional screenwriter who could hold meetings and take jobs regularly. The most satisfactory way is to write a draft, revise it once you feel it, send it to the director after revising it, and then make no more revisions. If the director is not satisfied, he can overturn it. His job ends the moment he delivers the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also worked with other directors whom he admired very much, but those scripts were not produced in the end, so he felt that there was no need for him to mention them to the public. As a movie was aborted, Wang Mu knew that writing a drama would have a greater chance of being filmed and would earn a higher income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his years as a screenwriter for literary films, he seemed to be in a paradise, able to gain maximum freedom in a small world. Writing a play is different. A bunch of people have a meeting and try to solve script problems using theories or methods. He wasn&#39;t quite sure what the people he was meeting with wanted. Listening to everyone talking about the terminology in the screenwriting book, I felt bored and tired. &lt;p>; It is a 12-episode crime drama that carefully describes the relationship between two people who conspired to kidnap. It is quite special. When talking about character relationships and criminal motives during the interview, Wang Mu took &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; as an example. Dostoevsky described in detail the long panorama of Raskolnikov&#39;s life before committing murder, &quot;writing crime to the bone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, he decided to make a movie of his own. After paying attention to someone suffering from depression or bipolar disorder, he was surprised by the size of this group and wanted to photograph people suffering from mental distress. In August, at Dalian Guoli Hospital, he walked through the unlocked iron gate and saw a pretty girl and a boy keeping a fixed distance behind her. &quot;He always keeps a fixed distance from the girl and never disturbs her life.&quot; Wang Mu wrote in his diary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The appearance of Dai Chun and Jue Xiao in &quot;Gentle Shell&quot; is a bit like the boy and girl Wang Mu saw. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many people think that when a writer turns to a director, you just finish the script and others do the rest for you. That’s impossible. You have to cooperate with different people to make them understand you. &quot;In general, a self-isolated creator must throw himself into an industrial structure, deal with different people, constantly persuade and compromise. To solve the problem, he can no longer escape from these. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the results, Wang Mu did a good job. The first draft of the script of &quot;Gentle Shell&quot; won the award in the venture capital section of the Pingyao Film Festival, with a bonus of 100,000. He tried filming footage, went to the Hainan Island International Film Festival for venture capital, won an award, and had start-up capital. Start looking for investors and talking about actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actor&#39;s past performance inertia needs to be respected, and a balance must be found between the actor&#39;s ideas and his own creation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think the most awesome thing about directors and producers is that they can choose accurately. It&#39;s not as good as being accurate on the spot. Right?&quot; Baike said that the role that made him famous was comedy. The narcissistic and self-deprecating grassroots king Sledgehammer in &quot;Never Expected&quot;. Wang Mu asked him to play Dai Chun&#39;s younger brother Dai He, a middle-aged man who wants to break away from his cursed native family and work hard for his own future. He has a strong sense of worldly fatigue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Wang Ziwen’s birthday, he received a painting from Wang Mu, in which a little girl was holding a lantern and an elephant was beside her. &quot;He thought I was such a little girl.&quot; Wang Ziwen said. When Wang Mu asked her to play Jue Xiao, she thought, why would she let me play such a gentle person? &quot;Qu Xiaoxiao (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wang Ziwen&#39;s character in &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;&lt;/span>;) is rebellious, powerful, or very sassy , Quirky, this is what most people think of me when they talk to me about roles.&quot; Wang Mu saw her vulnerability and tenacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Gentle Shell&quot; was shot in the order of the development of the story. Wang Mu almost never called for startup or interrupted, trying to capture the state of real life. Juexiao is reserved, Dai Chun is simple, and Dai He is depressed. Wang Ziwen, Yin Fang, and Baike supported each other and contributed delicate performances. At the beginning of 2023, &quot;Gentle Shell&quot; won three awards: &quot;Fei Mu Honor·Best Director&quot;, &quot;Fei Mu Honor·Best Actress&quot;, and &quot;Fei Mu Honor·Best Actor&quot; at the 6th Pingyao International Film Festival Grand prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For movies, from the feeling of pictures, rhythm and imagination to the specific production process. Wang Mu feels that it is a pity that he should be more patient and spend more time, &quot;I will tell each person more specifically - even if it is a person who has no lines and is just standing in the background - I will tell him myself. Play, communicate, and build a relationship with him.&quot; If we do this, there may not be many unsatisfactory things that need to be cut out in the later stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are too many problems.&quot; He even said so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told a story. After Dai Chun&#39;s father committed suicide, he walked to the overpass with blood on his body, waiting for Jue Xiao to appear. The original audio-visual focus was on Dai Chun. Looking back after half a year, Wang Mu realized that Juexiao also had to go through a very difficult journey. There should be a longer shot of Jue Xiao struggling through the crowd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He comforted himself that he would work hard on the next one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all this, a young director was born. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/f8KybXKqk3faRN5mcdz2o6FyEAX28htkyDSWinZj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1706&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/f8KybXKqk3faRN5mcdz2o6FyEAX28htkyDSWinZj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251383&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;Gentle Shell&quot;, Yin Fang and Baike&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;Be gentle&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are two short stories about Wang Mu, which happened before the filming and release of the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February and March 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, Wang Mu found that he could not watch the news. Contemporary writers who write so well cannot withstand the impact of the present. Great suspicion hung over him. He immersed himself in ancient books, from &quot;Water Margin&quot; to &quot;Guanwen Guanzhi&quot;, &quot;Yuewei Caotang Notes&quot; and &quot;Xuanguailu&quot;. The past world was not connected with the present. &quot;It gave me a lot of healing and release, and I could escape inside.&quot; But he felt like a Taoist priest from Mount Laoshan, losing himself in the vast world of ancient literature and in danger of falling into historical nihilism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2020, Wang Mu’s son was born. In addition to letting him take the initiative to end this time as a Taoist priest in Laoshan (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;those He sold all the books&lt;/span>;), which also made &quot;Gentle Shell&quot; more gentle. &quot;Gentle Shell&quot; started filming in October 2020. The filming location was changed from the bleak Dalian in early spring to the gentle Quanzhou, and was completed 41 days later. What he wanted the film to do was to get closer and understand, rather than watch and observe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the movie was released, Wang Mu posted a self-report on Douban: &quot;My academic path was quite satisfactory, my career as a screenwriter was tepid, I loved theater, but I had no chance to rehearse plays in thirteen years, so I acted recklessly. I wanted to make a movie, but I had no idea that in the process, I might have brought burdens to others. As I approach my forties, looking back at these things, I feel lucky that there are always people in my life who are gentle to me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;At the end of the film, Dai Chun and Jue Xiao still have unresolved life problems, but in the shell they built, they finally have the happiness of ordinary people. After the end credits appeared, a childish voice called mom and dad. That was the voice of Wang Mu&#39;s son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the film is finished filming, it will be a long wait until it is released. When Wang Mu was anxious, he saw on Douyin that someone was cutting wood to build a house and make coffee in the wilderness. He watched it for a long time. It feels so good to accomplish something alone. He bought wood online and focused on it for six or seven hours, sawing the wood, sanding it into a shape, and applying wax. Very cool. He made a small wooden horse and a bird and gave them to his son. Of course, his son thought such toys were too boring and didn&#39;t know where to put them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During that time, he also carved seals, bought stones in an online store, and followed the book given by the store to learn to carve &quot;The best is like water.&quot; The operation is highly standardized, has nothing to do with art, and is very decompressive. Now Wang Mu has uncarved stones and uncarved wood in his house. This is all half-measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But he also knows very well that when it comes to other matters related to creation, he will not give up halfway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Thanks to Meng Yiyi and Yang Nan for their help with this article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[体操传奇“丘妈”：一见钟情到倾尽一生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257954]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/30/YfgSivZw1YRSKjBKRAVpoBqzcwpONcAYbEmbkwDH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/YfgSivZw1YRSKjBKRAVpoBqzcwpONcAYbEmbkwDH . jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252880&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, Chusovitina competed in the vaulting competition at the Hangzhou Asian Games Afterwards, he greeted the audience &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 28, 2023, the women’s vault final of competitive gymnastics at the Hangzhou Asian Games ended , Oksana Chusovitina did not win a medal, but every time she landed on a jump, she sparked bursts of cheers and applause in the venue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the preliminaries, Chusovitina advanced to the finals in fifth place.

An Changyu and Yu Linmin are 20 years old this year, while Qiusowei Jinna has passed her 48th birthday. Except for her, no other gymnast is still active in the world competition at this age. She did it and showed a first-class competitive level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chusovitina’s more than 40-year sports career, she retired three times and came back three times. She has told the outside world many reasons for persisting - for her son, for the country, for honor. But looking back at every comeback, you will find that she was reluctant to leave the sport. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at it from another perspective, gymnastics gave her hope that she could persevere. It was gymnastics that gave her the money and opportunity to heal her son, and gave her the sustenance to temporarily forget her pain during the most difficult period. , turning her from an ordinary person into a hero who brings glory to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her life has long been integrated with gymnastics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/XSnwe6i2JDFHZZgKXG5Ce1qYEkjmYSYmsf6VruCW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;616&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/XSnwe6i2JDFHZZgKXG5Ce1qYEkjmYSYmsf6VruCW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252877&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, Chusovitina won fourth place in the women&#39;s vault final of competitive gymnastics at the Hangzhou Asian Games&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;When is the &quot;last jump&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chusovina has so far represented 3 countries and regions (including the CIS) in eight consecutive Olympic Games. Behind every change of nationality, there are historical and personal experiences. The turmoil of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1975, Chusovitina was born in Bukhara, the former Soviet Union, now the capital of Bukhara Oblast in Uzbekistan. She began training in gymnastics when she was 7 years old. At the age of 13, she won the all-around championship in the Soviet Youth Gymnastics Competition. At the 1990 World Sports Expo in Japan, she won the individual all-around championship and all individual gymnastics championships except the high and low bars. At the 1991 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships, she won the championship in the floor exercise event and the runner-up in the women&#39;s vault event. However, there were many athletes of the same level as her in the Soviet gymnastics team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The afterglow of the Soviet Union shone in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The participating lineup of the Commonwealth of Independent States, composed of 11 former Soviet republics, was basically athletes trained during the Soviet period. The CIS team participating in the women&#39;s gymnastics team event was composed of 6 selected athletes from more than 30 athletes. Chusovitina was successfully selected, and the team also won the team gold medal without any surprise. Chusovitina feels that being selected into the participating team is more difficult than winning the championship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Barcelona Olympics, Chusovitina, like other athletes, returned to play in their respective countries. The training conditions in Uzbekistan are poor, and Chusovitina often practices on abandoned and unsafe equipment, but she has supported the honor of the entire country in the gymnastics world. From 1993 to 2006, Chusovitina participated in various gymnastics competitions for Uzbekistan and won 70 medals in international competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this period, Chusovitina announced her retirement twice. The first time was in 1996 because of marriage; the second time was in 1999 because of pregnancy, but both retirements did not last long. From 1997 to 1998, she was still active in the international arena and played in the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games. After giving birth to her son Alyosha at the end of 1999, she quickly returned to preparations and participated in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I really decided at that time to end my gymnastics career.&quot; After giving birth, Chusovitina thought so, but when she stood on the training ground again, she was shaken again. &quot;One time when I passed by the training hall, I saw the familiar training facilities and my former teammates. I walked to the mirror and looked at it. I felt that I was not old and could still bring honor to my motherland.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;This comeback started a long career journey for her. Perhaps she had never thought of persisting for so long. It was fate that pushed her into a desperate situation with no way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/UkTI0UzAKG3kkzvIXjrEqJmS1LD37TzWCEUv4QwT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;619&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/UkTI0UzAKG3kkzvIXjrEqJmS1LD37TzWCEUv4QwT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 4, 2006, Cologne, Germany, Chusovitina took a photo with her son before training&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2002, Chusovitina participated in the Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, and won two gold medals and two silver medals with her super strength. When she called her mother and son to report the good news, she learned that her son had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. &quot;Fate always gives me the most fatal blow when I am happiest.

She and her husband sold all their belongings, but the money they raised was far from enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Uzbekistan failed to fulfill its promise of bonuses for athletes to win Asian Games gold medals, so Chusovitina had to find another way. She began playing for a club in Germany, and in exchange, the other party provided Alyosha with treatment opportunities and financial support. &quot;I decided at that time that I would participate in all the games I could, just to raise money for my son&#39;s treatment. I didn&#39;t care if these games were difficult or not, I just knew that when I was injured, I had to stand up and compete in other games. &quot;She can&#39;t stop and she can&#39;t retire. &quot;If I retire, I will sit by the hospital bed and watch my son die...Who will help a former world champion?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/09/30/t7ts0wihzBP1i0GwlVk5LqhJAL6uUq6EFXCdJ47w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/30/t7ts0wihzBP1i0GwlVk5LqhJAL6uUq6EFXCdJ47w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252878&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;1992 Barcelona Olympics, Chusovitina In the balance beam competition &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2006, Chusovitina joined Germany despite the pressure of public opinion about betraying her motherland.

After the London Olympics, Chusovitina was 37 years old, and her son fortunately recovered, but she did not choose to retire. In 2013, she re-naturalized as an Uzbek citizen and continued to compete in the world for herself and her motherland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As she grows older, Chusovitina truly feels the limitations of her physical fitness. In the women&#39;s gymnastics qualifying competition for the Tokyo Olympics, she made a mistake in landing on her first jump and her right foot went out of bounds. She still made a mistake in landing on her second jump and failed to advance to the finals. She cried on the sidelines after the game and announced her retirement the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months later, she decided to make a comeback again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/YSLDDa28sLrJuvhgpozcocHDmlnmiHv7uHuA8A35.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;769&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/YSLDDa28sLrJuvhgpozcocHDmlnmiHv7uHuA8A35.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252881&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On August 17, 2008, Chusovitina showed off her silver medal after the women&#39;s vault award ceremony at the Beijing Olympic Games&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Where Love Begins&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Chusovitina made the decision to retire two years ago, no one doubted that she would Saying goodbye to gymnastics was a decision that seemed perfectly reasonable. She was 46 years old at the time. She had won awards in almost every competition in gymnastics, and her son had grown up safely and healthily. Many people told her that it was time to rest, and she thought so for a while. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But two months after leaving gymnastics, she knew it was a foolish decision. In an interview with China News Weekly, she said: &quot;Why should I give up something that brings me happiness? I have never dissuaded others from stopping work. Why would anyone dissuade me from stopping the work I like? Have you really abandoned it?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She returned to the training ground and insisted on practicing every day, although the time was much less than before. When she was young, she could train for seven or eight hours a day. Later, she became more and more aware that training needed to focus on method and efficiency. Now, she trains for three hours a day, but she records every move and every jump, and then reviews it carefully to try to adjust to the best condition for every attempt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the preparations for the Hangzhou Asian Games, China International Television went to follow her training. When she faced the camera, she said: &quot;I love learning. When I made a mistake during the jump, all of us were together. Work hard to correct it, and when we do this, my heart will be filled with joy.&quot; Every training session is an enjoyment for her, &quot;This is not a vanity fair for athletes.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiuso Virgina doesn&#39;t want to set an example or achieve any record, she just loves gymnastics. Even during the years when she competed to treat her son&#39;s illness, gymnastics was never a task she was forced to take on, but a solace in her life. &quot;I just continue to do what I like, which makes me feel less uncomfortable. My mind is no longer occupied by those thoughts, so at that time, it was exercise that gave me a lot of relief.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In many interviews, Chusovitina has mentioned that she fell in love with gymnastics at first sight. At that time, as the youngest child in the family, she was very naughty and was sometimes kicked out of kindergarten. In order not to let her stay alone at home, her mother took her to watch her brother train in gymnastics. Later, her brother got tired of training after three months, but she persisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She always remembers that day when all the girls were training on the other side of the training room. “Some were jumping and some were running.

This means that the two companies are no longer government financing platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar actions have occurred frequently across Jiangsu in the past year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, from December 2022 to the present (as of September 26, 2023), a total of 215 urban investment companies in Jiangsu have announced their withdrawal from government financing platforms, involving 7 prefecture-level cities including Suzhou and Changzhou. city. There are 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same period, some urban investment companies in Henan, Liaoning and other provinces also announced their withdrawal from government financing platforms, but only a few of them. This time, why did Jiangsu take such drastic measures to ask local urban investment companies to withdraw from the government financing platform? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lFAFmo4x70PlglflyM6y0l9caeUdVMaAlnMHjGT3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1266&quot; height= &quot;948&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lFAFmo4x70PlglflyM6y0l9caeUdVMaAlnMHjGT3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252479&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From December 2022 to the present (as of September 26, 2023), a total of 215 urban investment companies in Jiangsu have announced their withdrawal from government financing platforms, involving 7 prefecture-level cities including Suzhou and Changzhou . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Four ways to exit government financing platforms&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;According to many urban investment practitioners in Jiangsu, the withdrawal of local urban investment companies from the government financing platform refers to the withdrawal from Jiangsu’s comprehensive local debt supervision platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Being the first in the country to establish a full-scale debt management system covering government debt, government implicit debt, and operating debt of financing platform companies.” In August 2023, the Jiangsu Provincial Audit Office announced the 2022 Provincial Audit results of level-level budget execution and other fiscal revenue and expenditures&quot; said when reviewing the work in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Implicit debt refers to debts borrowed by local governments beyond the statutory government debt limit, either directly or by promising to repay with fiscal funds, or by illegally providing guarantees. The debt-raising entities are usually local urban investment companies. Like government debt, local governments need to bear the repayment responsibility for implicit debts, while the operating debt of urban investment companies has nothing to do with the government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2022, a procurement document from the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance showed that the Ministry of Finance had established a full-caliber debt monitoring platform system. Among them, the hidden debt monitoring system counts and monitors changes in existing hidden debts on a monthly basis. In addition, there is a system for real-time statistical monitoring of financing platform debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Ministry of Finance’s debt monitoring platform, Jiangsu has also established its own local debt supervision system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2019, a procurement announcement issued by the Wuxi Municipal Finance Bureau revealed that according to the work deployment requirements of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Provincial Department of Finance, the Wuxi Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Wuxi Municipal Finance Bureau purchased debts in Xinwu District On the basis of the system, we will optimize, improve, deeply develop and pilot the comprehensive supervision system for local government debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The local government comprehensive debt supervision system has been affirmed by the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, and has been designated for promotion and application in 13 prefecture-level cities across the province.&quot; The official website of Wuxi Big Data Administration Bureau said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People from urban investment companies in Guizhou and other places told Southern Weekend reporters that local urban investment debt data mainly relies on the statistics of the Ministry of Finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Regional governments should strengthen the full-scale debt monitoring and control of financing platform companies, and comprehensively understand the bottom line of government hidden debts, operating debts and contingent liabilities of financing platform companies.” In 2021, Jiangsu Province issued the “ &quot;Guiding Opinions on Regulating the Investment and Financing Behavior of Financing Platform Companies&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guiding Opinions on Financing Platforms&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the operating debt of Jiangsu Urban Investment Company has also been included in the debt supervision system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But how do urban investment companies withdraw from government financing platforms? A table obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that a prefecture-level city in Jiangsu is compiling a list of urban investment companies that will withdraw from fiscal supervision in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The table indicates that there are four types of exit: withdrawal from the regulatory scope due to the lifting of the guarantee relationship, cancellation (the debt has been cleared), merger into other platform companies (debts are transferred to other platform companies), and marketization Transform into a non-platform state-owned enterprise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the announcements from local governments in Jiangsu, the main exit type of urban investment platforms is to transform into non-platform enterprises, which is generally expressed as: &quot;Transform into market-oriented operating entities and withdraw from government financing platforms from the date of announcement.&quot; , no longer assumes government financing functions, operates independently in accordance with the law as an independent market entity, and is responsible for its own profits and losses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Urban investment companies across Jiangsu have transformed into non-platform state-owned enterprises and need to clear their hidden debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2022, Jiangdu District, Yangzhou City issued a financing platform integration and cleanup plan. The document states that for companies with a certain asset scale and management capabilities, the government&#39;s implicit debts will be paid off, financing functions will be divested, and market-oriented transformation will be achieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person who works for a city investment platform in Jiangsu told Southern Weekend reporters that the company’s hidden debts have been cleared before an announcement is made in 2022 to transform into a non-platform enterprise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, 8 of the 215 urban investment companies in Jiangsu that have withdrawn from government financing platforms have been cancelled. In addition, the above form requires filling in the reasons for the urban investment company to be placed under supervision, the balance of implicit debt, the balance of operating debt, and the type of exit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that industrial and commercial data show that among the 215 companies, 192 are subsidiaries at all levels and are not directly affiliated with administrative institutions. There are only 80 urban investment companies with renewal bonds, bank borrowings, accounts receivable financing, and financial leasing. Among them, only 7 companies have renewal bonds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the urban investment company has financing capabilities, especially if it has issued bonds, it means that the company has a large asset scale and has certain operating capabilities, and is not a shell company. Data from the Enterprise Early Warning Channel show that among the 215 urban investment companies, the 2022 industrial and commercial information of 112 companies shows zero employees or no information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, a large number of urban investment companies that have withdrawn from government financing platforms have small asset sizes or are shell companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Withdrawal from the original CBRC supervision list&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, there have been cases of urban investment companies withdrawing from government financing platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 2011, the former China Banking Regulatory Commission began to implement a &quot;list system&quot; management of urban investment platforms. The list was updated every quarter, which affected the financing activities of urban investment platforms such as bank loans and the issuance of public bonds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the former China Banking Regulatory Commission suspended statistics on the list. Guangdong Securities Research Report shows that as of the end of 2018, there were 11,737 financing platforms on the list, of which 2,710 have been gradually removed, leaving 9,027. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past decade or so, urban investment companies in various regions have withdrawn from government financing platforms, mainly referring to withdrawing from the supervision list of urban investment platforms by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2015, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Fujian Nanping City issued an announcement stating that by actively strengthening communication and approval with the government and the China Banking Regulatory Commission, one of its urban investment companies was officially withdrawn from the government financing platform, &quot;marking the The company&#39;s market-oriented financing functions have been fully restored.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to ease financing pressure, various places are trying to find ways to withdraw from the regulatory list. However, according to a document issued by the former China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2013, multiple conditions need to be met to exit the regulatory list of urban investment companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if the asset-liability ratio is below 70%, the financial report has been audited by an accounting firm; the part of existing loans that requires financial repayment has been included in local fiscal budget management, and the source of budget funds has been implemented, and the existing The mortgage guarantee, loan term, repayment method, etc. of the loan have been rectified and qualified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An urban investment practitioner in Jiangsu told a Southern Weekend reporter that another purpose for urban investment companies in various regions to withdraw from the original regulatory list of the China Banking Regulatory Commission is to participate in government PPP projects as social capital parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the former China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Banking and Insurance Institutions to Further Prevent and Resolve Local Government Hidden Debt Risks&quot;, requiring that it is strictly prohibited to provide current loans to borrowers who bear local government hidden debts. , it is strictly prohibited to add or falsely resolve hidden government debts, further limiting the financing space of urban investment companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the original CBRC urban investment supervision list stopped updating, it is still functioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is a bank credit line, but the loan cannot be released.” Huang Hui, a staff member of an urban investment company in Shandong, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the above-mentioned Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission document was released, because it was on the regulatory list , the company&#39;s liquidity loans were greatly restricted. Since then, the company has repaid hidden debts through financial fund repayment and other methods. It was not until it was withdrawn from the regulatory list last year that financing returned to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, urban investment companies in Henan, Liaoning and other places have also withdrawn from government financing platforms, but they have not specified what kind of platforms. In addition, multiple announcements show that county-level government units can approve the withdrawal of urban investment companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2020, the Tanghe County Government in Henan Province issued an announcement stating that after research and approval by the county government, it was decided that Tanghe County Hongxiang Investment Group Co., Ltd. would be a market-oriented transformation entity and would withdraw from the government from the date of the announcement. investment platform. In May 2022, the Dalian Pulandian District government also approved eight urban investment companies to withdraw from the government financing platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, when urban investment companies across Jiangsu withdraw from financing platforms, they need to report to the provincial and municipal governments and wait for approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Since this year, 18 companies have applied to the province and city to withdraw from the financing platform supervision system.&quot; In September 2023, the &quot;Sheyang County Party Committee&#39;s Report on the Progress of Inspections&quot; was released on the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision. ” wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the announcements of various localities withdrawing from financing platforms, the core content is to explain to the outside world that urban investment companies will no longer assume government financing functions and will separate subsequent borrowing from government debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Reduce the number of financing platforms&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The official websites of Jiangsu county and district governments show that in 2022, Jiangsu will begin to reduce the number of urban investment platforms on a large scale and set goals . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Jurong City, Jiangsu Province released the &quot;Pilot Work Plan for Reducing the Number of Financing Platform Companies from 2022 to 2026&quot;, which stated that the number of financing platform companies will be reduced year by year, and the number of 10 financing platform companies will be reduced by 2022. By 2023, it is planned to reduce the number of 15 financing platform companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Promote the integration, mergers, and market-oriented transformation of financing platform companies.” In July 2023, Wang Tianqi, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, emphasized at a meeting that the high-cost debt “peak reduction operation” will continue to be carried out , implement “one account, one policy” guidance for financing platform companies with high market attention, large existing debt scale, concentrated payment periods, and tight capital chains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now when the person in charge of an urban investment company goes to the government for a meeting, the first thing he reports is not the current status of the company’s operations, but the situation of debt reduction.” A Jiangsu urban investment practitioner said that debt reduction and the extended Tasks such as financing platform integration are the most important things for urban investment companies at the moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The government is accelerating the integration of financing platforms because Jiangsu has a large number of urban investment companies at the county, district and even town and street levels. They generally have heavy debt burdens, small market sizes, and poor operating capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, the Jiangsu Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission introduced in reply to a CPPCC proposal that among the province’s financing platform companies, county (district) level and development zone, functional zone and township-level financing platform companies accounted for Compared to nearly 90%. Judging from the total amount of state-owned assets and operating debt, counties (districts) account for more than half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, among the number of platforms to be reduced this time, county and township-level financing platforms are the focus. In the above form of a prefecture-level city in Jiangsu, it is required to fill in whether it is a township-level platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2023, government departments in Dafeng District of Yancheng City, Qingjiangpu District of Huai&#39;an City, and Yangzhou District of Zhenjiang have successively issued announcements stating that all town-level financing platforms will be integrated into the district and county level, or that township-level financing platforms will be completely cancelled. platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the 14th Jiangsu Provincial Committee conducted two rounds of inspections in 44 counties and districts. Jiangsu has a total of 95 counties and districts. Public information shows that the rectification progress of the two rounds of inspections will be announced to the public in January 2023 and September 2023 respectively. On the eve of the announcement of the rectification progress, it was the time when urban investment companies intensively issued announcements to withdraw from the financing platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Statistics from Southern Weekend reporters found that among the rectification reports of 44 counties and districts, 21 counties and districts mentioned the integration or reduction of the number of urban investment platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Ming is an executive of a consulting company in Beijing, mainly providing transformation consulting services to urban investment platforms. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the withdrawal of financing platforms across Jiangsu was indeed related to inspections and rectifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Ming explained that some time ago, a Jiangsu urban investment platform contacted him, saying that after an inspection, he found that the local urban investment platform had heavy debts, dispersed assets, and many shell companies, and hoped to find a solution to reduce the number of platforms. Improve the financing capabilities of the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Can it be truly transformed&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;More than 200 urban investment companies in Jiangsu have withdrawn from the financing platform. What impact will it have on the market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 25, 2023, Huafu Securities statistics found that among the 287 urban investment companies across the country that had withdrawn from financing platforms, the bond trading activity on the bond issuance platform was not high. The average monthly transaction volume from January to August 2023 is generally low, mostly below 10%. Four platforms even had no transaction volume during the year. Their activity is generally low and they receive less attention from the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ren Hua is the person in charge of a financial leasing company in Shanghai. His main customer groups are urban investment platforms across Jiangsu. Ren Hua told Southern Weekend reporters that they had investigated the withdrawal of platforms in Jiangsu and found that none of the major financing platforms in various places had withdrawn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;If it is still a financing platform, urban investment bonds can be renewed by borrowing new ones and repaying old ones. But if it withdraws from the list, financing will depend on its ability.&quot; Ren Hua explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, large and medium-sized urban investment companies have one or more strong main businesses. For smaller urban investment platforms, how to achieve true transformation and have sustainable operating capabilities without relying on government infrastructure and other projects is a more difficult problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wu Ming, when urban investment platforms across Jiangsu consulted him, &quot;how to maintain sustainable operating capabilities&quot; was also a frequently asked question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the inspection and rectification reports of the above-mentioned 21 counties and districts, the approach taken by each locality is to integrate financing platforms for similar businesses and clarify the main business direction of each company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Feng County’s inspection and rectification report stated that four groups were established: urban construction, industrial investment, agriculture and water, and Xinfeng, and their main businesses were respectively approved for urban construction, park development, agriculture and water tourism, and financial services. plate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, compared with market-oriented transformation, cancellation and other methods, the resistance to integrating urban investment platforms is greater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s like two families living together. The rich don’t like living with the poor.” An executive of an urban investment company in Guizhou told a Southern Weekend reporter that the local government had also planned to promote platform integration, but The effect is not good. &quot;If a bad enterprise is integrated and one of its loans is overdue, the entire group will be overdue.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the effect of the transformation of urban investment companies across Jiangsu remains to be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huafu Securities research report shows that among the bond-issuing urban investment platforms that will withdraw from the platform in 2021-2022, except for Chibi Urban Construction, Licheng State Investment and other platforms, there are small-scale business fluctuations, and most urban investment platforms The role of undertaking local infrastructure business has not changed, the proportion of public welfare and quasi-public welfare business is still high, and there is no obvious market-oriented transformation trend at the business level. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Ren Hua, Wu Ming, and Huang Hui are pseudonyms.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br >;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[自西徂东：秦国崛起的四级跳 | 古国多少事②]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257343]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It is about 400 kilometers from the Dabaozi Mountain tombs to the ruins of the front hall of Afang Palace, a 5-hour drive; more than 2,000 Years ago, it took those vague-faced Qin people more than six hundred years to reach the same distance.

The river is clear and shallow, and the reed flowers look like snow. At the fork in the road, I asked two old men sunbathing for directions. Afterwards, the car passed through the village road and turned onto a rough dirt road. There are twists and turns, and on the other side of the mountain, withered yellow weeds dance in the wind, hiding countless pits and caves. Some pits also have red warning signs: Archaeological site, no entry allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I saw was part of a tomb complex covering an area of ​​18 square kilometers. Just under these decaying weeds and trees, in the 1990s, archaeologists excavated 4 large tombs and 9 small and medium-sized tombs, as well as a large number of funerary objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The owner of the tomb pointed to a tribe called Qin that was active in Longdong and Guanzhong more than 2,000 years ago. Their leader was the direct ancestor of Qin Shihuang, the later emperor of the ages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Historical Records&quot;, the Qin people are descendants of Zhuan Xu. Among Zhuanxu&#39;s descendants, there was one named Dafei, also known as Boyi and Baiyi. Dafei lived during the eras of Shun and Yu. He first assisted Yu in water control, and then tamed birds and beasts for Shun. &quot;Many birds and beasts were tamed&quot;; so Shun gave him the surname Ying. This is the origin of Qin Shihuang&#39;s family name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fei Chang is a descendant of Da Fei and has superb royal skills. When Cheng Tang attacked Xia Jie, it was Fei Chang who drove the car. During the Shang generation, the Ying family was highly valued by the King of Shang. At the end of the Shang Dynasty, Feilian and his son Wei Lai &quot;both used their talents and abilities to serve the Yin Dynasty&quot;. After the fall of the Shang Dynasty, the Ying family, as a stubborn reactionary force of the Yin and Shang Dynasties, was moved by the King of Zhou to the western border area - mainly today&#39;s Tianshui and Longnan areas of Gansu Province. At that time, they lived together with the nomadic people called Rong or Xirong. The environment was harsh and their survival was difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the reign of King Mu of Zhou Dynasty, the Ying family gave birth to another man with superb royal skills, named Zaofu. Zaofu once drove to the west with King Mu, and when King Xu Yan rebelled, he accompanied King Mu to the east. Therefore, King Mu granted the city of Zhao to Zaofu. Zaofu took Zhao as his surname, which was the origin of the Zhao family. Qin and Zhao, who later fought endless wars, were actually brothers of the same clan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Qin Shihuang&#39;s family does not belong to the Cepheid branch - Qin Shihuang&#39;s family is the descendant of Erai, and Cepheus is the descendant of Erlai&#39;s brother Ji Sheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on the past events of the Qin Kingdom, Feizi is a key figure that cannot be ignored. If the later Qin State was like a big tree with lush branches and leaves, then Feizi was the first root of this big tree. Because, starting from Feizi, Qin only existed in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feizi’s father is Da Luo. While the descendants of Zaofu from the same clan were in great turmoil in the Zhao region, Daluo was still trapped in Xiquanqiu (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;, also known as Xicui, today&#39;s Li County, Gansu&lt; /span>;), surrounded by Rong tribes, trying to survive in the cracks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like his ancestors who spent a lot of money, Feizi also &quot;good at horses and livestock, and good at raising them.&quot; At that time, horses were both an important source of power and an indispensable part of the chariot. For a country or tribe, the number of horses plays a decisive role. King Xiao of Zhou summoned Feizi to the meeting of Miwei to raise horses for the royal family. As a result, &quot;the horses have a good rest&quot; - the horses are fat and strong, and they give birth to many foals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, scholars have debated endlessly about the location of the Miwei Society. Qian is the Mi River and Wei is the Wei River. Mihe River, also known as Qianhe River, is a tributary of Weihe River. The Meeting of Mi and Wei is also called between Mi and Wei. Therefore, this land with rich water and grass suitable for livestock grazing should be within the angle formed by Qianhe River and Wei River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianhuo Expressway runs from east to west, parallel to the Wei River. After passing Guo Town, from the north bank of Weihe River to the south bank, the overpass led me to the Baoji Transit Expressway. 10 kilometers westbound, a bridge spans from east to west. The river surface is very narrow, but the river bed is extremely wide, spreading like a plain all the way to the distant green mountains. This is Qianhe. A few hundred meters south of the window on my left, Qianhe flows into the Weihe River. To the northwest outside the window on my right, the urban area with dense buildings and factories was Feizi&#39;s pasture more than two thousand years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, a wetland park covering an area of ​​more than ten square kilometers has been built at the intersection of Qianhe River and Weihe River. Although the Qianhe and Weihe rivers I saw were both narrow and not rich in water, their wide river beds made people imagine that when the rainy season comes, they must be big and turbulent rivers. It was late autumn, and the grass and trees on the riverbed in the distance and on the mesa further away were still green, which seemed to imply that this was a good place for the growth of grass and trees, as well as cattle and horses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ItLzMP5lAyMXgjyz32EEdUT72SVUf82KJZkX0Qmu.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ItLzMP5lAyMXgjyz32EEdUT72SVUf82KJZkX0Qmu.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Feizi Muma&#39;s meeting in Qianwei&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Feizi&#39;s achievements in raising horses were richly rewarded: King Zhou Xiao planned to make him the heir to his father Da Luo. However, King Xiao&#39;s plan will definitely harm the interests of Feizi&#39;s half-brother Cheng Cheng, whose maternal grandfather was a very influential Marquis Shen in the Western Zhou Dynasty. Marquis Shen firmly objected, so King Xiao had to adopt a compromise approach - he said: In the past, he spent a lot of money to take charge of livestock for Shun, so Shun gave him the surname Ying. Now his descendants raise horses for me, and I divide the land into vassals. So, his reward to Feizi was: &quot;Qin in the city&quot;. That is to say, the land of Qin was granted to Feizi and he was named Qin Ying. The rank given to Feizi was vassal - the so-called vassal, whose title was lower than that of the prince Bo Zinan, and whose fiefdom did not exceed 50 miles. The prince was not qualified to directly meet the emperor and was attached to a certain prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although his status is insignificant - in comparison, Song is a duke, Qi and Jin are marquis, Zheng is an earl, and Chu is a viscount - when the princes met for an alliance, the king of Chu was too low in rank. He was not even qualified to enter the venue, and Feizi&#39;s level was even lower than Chuzi&#39;s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, no matter how low the title is, it also means that Feizi, a member of the Ying clan, has not only obtained a formal title, but also has a hereditary territory; more importantly, from now on, the world has Qin and Qin people - the first Qin person was none other than Fei Zi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where is the Qin that King Zhou Xiao conferred on Feizi? Historical data shows that it was in the Zhangjiachuan and Qingshui areas of Gansu Province. There are different opinions on the more specific location: it is believed to be in Qinting Township, Qingshui, and it is believed to be in Waquan Village, Zhangjiachuan. In fact, the two places are only twenty or thirty kilometers apart, so they may both be Feizi&#39;s fiefdoms. Not only that, but Mumatan in Maiji District, more than 80 kilometers to the south, is also considered Feizi&#39;s territory. More than two thousand years ago, this area was vast and sparsely populated. Feizi and his people drove herds of livestock and lived in pursuit of water and grass. Cattle and sheep multiplied, the population multiplied, and Ying Qin grew stronger step by step like a snowball. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xirong is the collective name given by the Huaxia people to other ethnic groups living in the northwest region during the pre-Qin period. Compared with the Huaxia people, Xirong is culturally backward, advocates force, is aggressive, and often conflicts with the Huaxia people. The ancestors of the Zhou Dynasty originally lived in Bin (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;today&#39;s Bin County and Xunyi area of ​​Shaanxi Province&lt;/span>;). Due to the long-term invasion by the Western Rong, they had to move east. Moved to Zhouyuan. Feizi&#39;s ancestors were originally moved to Xiquanqiu by the King of Zhou as a border guard. Their mission was: &quot;Be in Xirong and protect Xichui.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gui is a food vessel made of bronze and is often used together with a tripod. In 1980, a Gui with a missing cover was unearthed from a Western Zhou tomb in Tengzhou, Shandong. The inscription on the gui shows that its owner cannot call him, so he calls him &quot;not his gui&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inscription on Buqi Gui tells the story of Buqi receiving the order from the King of Zhou and his relationship with the invading Yan Xun (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;i.e. The 烃狁 (a branch of the Rong) fought in Gaoling, winning three times in three battles, and was rewarded by the King of Zhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is it? He is Feizi&#39;s great-great-grandson Duke Zhuang of Qin. During the reign of Qin Zhong, the father of Duke Zhuang of Qin, the Xirong army attacked Xiquqiu, and the descendants of Feizi&#39;s brother Cheng were wiped out. The consequence of this incident was that the Feizi lineage, which was originally a branch of the Ying family, became the authentic sect of the Ying family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Xuan of Zhou appointed Qin Zhong as his official to attack Xirong. However, the isolated Qin people were no match for Xirong, and Qin Zhong died in the battle. After Qin Zhong&#39;s death, his five sons, including Bu Qi, were filled with grief and anger, and asked King Xuan of Zhou to send troops. King Xuan sent a team of 7,000 people, together with the Qin people, to defeat Xirong around 820 BC and regained Xiquqiu, which was occupied by Xirong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the war, King Xuan of Zhou appointed Duke Zhuang of Qin as the doctor of Xicui and gave him Xiquanqiu. As a result, the activity center of the Qin people for several generations since Feizi moved from today&#39;s Tianshui area to the Li County area in Longnan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dabaozi Mountain is more than ten kilometers away from Lixian County, and the Western Han River flows slowly between the two mountains. Many cultural relics unearthed here show that this is a long-standing Qin clan tomb. In fact, long before the country officially conducted archeology, many cultural relic dealers went to the Dabaozi Mountain area to rob tombs, and a large number of precious cultural relics flowed from here to all over the world. Bao Bao, a poet from Li County, told me that when he was a boy, farmers working in the fields often dug out some bronze utensils. Experts have determined that this is the Xicui Cemetery, one of the four major cemeteries of the Qin people. So, who is the most likely Qin Jun sleeping in Dabaozi Mountain? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/0STMPyplaX7gaKEdmtZJriuhSDe0SHGnvbLdtj1A.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/0STMPyplaX7gaKEdmtZJriuhSDe0SHGnvbLdtj1A.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131202&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qin Tombs in Dabaozi Mountain, Li County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; Various clues point to Qin Xianggong. In the history of the development of the Qin State, Qin Xianggong not only established the country by chance, but also led the Qin people out of Longnan and marched into Guanzhong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the reign of Duke Xiang of Qin, the Emperor of Zhou was the mediocre King You of Zhou. King You deposed the eldest son and established a young one. The prince&#39;s maternal grandfather Shenhou joined forces with the Western Rong to attack Zhou. King You was killed and Shenhou&#39;s grandson came to the throne as King Ping of Zhou. King Ping moved the capital from Haojing to Luoyi, and history moved from the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When King Ping moved eastward, Jin, Wei, Zheng and other countries formed a coalition to escort him, and Qin people with much different ranks also joined the coalition. Afterwards, King Ping rewarded Qin Xianggong for his merits and promoted Qin Xianggong to an earl. This ended the Qin people&#39;s vassal career and promoted them to princes. At that time, it had been more than 130 years since Feizi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Qin Xianggong is likely to be buried in the Xicui Cemetery in Dabaozi Mountain, then where is the Xicui Palace built during the Zhuanggong period, the first &quot;capital&quot; of the Qin people? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the tradition of the Qin people that the distance between the capital and the mausoleum is mostly between 5 and 15 kilometers, Xicui Palace is located near Dabaozi Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of landform and environment, it is quite ingenious to choose the &quot;capital&quot; here: in the Dabaozi Mountain area, the Xihe River and the Xihan River meet, forming a fertile small basin. Dabaozi Mountain, with its steep western slope and gentle eastern slope, dominates it to the west. Yanguan, which is rich in salt, guards its east. Qishan Fort, which was once rated as one of the three major fortresses in the country by Emperor Wei Wen, controls it. More than 2,000 years ago, the climate here was warm and humid, with abundant rainfall and heat, suitable for farming and animal husbandry, and the products were abundant. The unique salt industry resources, coupled with the martial spirit of the Qin people tempered by years of battles and killings, although the population of the Qin people is still small, in hundreds of years, it will develop and grow bit by bit, and split into a world that is frightening. The Tiger and Wolf Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/yvIZFzFW3VigSBJZMrimO63Lgwy1ZLxqXAUkGYJP.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/yvIZFzFW3VigSBJZMrimO63Lgwy1ZLxqXAUkGYJP.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131203&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Village at the foot of Dabaozi Mountain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Inheritance: Loess Pingyang and Yongcheng under the Emperor&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 238 BC, Ying Zheng entered his 10th year of succession to the throne. In April of this year, he held a coronation ceremony, which meant that he began to rule personally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surprisingly, the ceremony was not held in Xianyang, the capital of Qin, but in Yongcheng, 150 kilometers west of Xianyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the young Ying Zheng, Yongcheng not only built a palace, but also buried many of his ancestors. It was of great significance in the history of Qin State to carry forward the past and open up the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story has to start with King Ping of Zhou. In addition to making Qin a vassal, King Ping also wrote a blank check to the Qin people: he gave the Qin and Feng lands that had been occupied by the Xirong - roughly equivalent to today&#39;s Baoji, Shaanxi to Tianshui, Gansu - to the Qin people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After many years of bloody battles between Qin Xianggong and his son Qin Wengong, when Duke Wen of Qin arrived, the bad check was actually cashed: the Qin people took the land of Qifeng into their hands. Including the Miweihui, where Feizi used to herd horses for the King of Zhou, also returned to the Qin people after being lost for hundreds of years. Among them, the war against the Rong launched by Duke Wen in 750 BC &quot;collected the remaining Zhou people&quot; - after King Ping moved eastward, a large number of Zhou people remained in the Qifeng area. The Qin State not only occupied the land of Qifeng, but also Turn these Zhou people into Qin people. This also means that the Qin people have since entered the fertile Guanzhong Plain, and the center of gravity of rule has shifted from Longnan to central Shaanxi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Wengong, who has enjoyed the country for 50 years, is a powerful character. When he conquered Rongdong and entered the outside world, he had two major events worthy of note: one was the establishment of historians, and the history of Qin State has been recorded in writing; the other was the establishment of crimes against three tribes and torture. The later Qin State was famous for its harsh punishments, and the instigator was Duke Wen of Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Qin Wen Gong expanded eastward and stationed himself at Ma Miwei, he had to wait until his son Qin Xiangong to move the capital from Xiquanqiu to Pingyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Near the Guozhen East Interchange of Lianhuo Expressway, about ten kilometers west of Qianweizhihui Wetland Park, fields and factories are mixed, and residential buildings and factories are intertwined. It is a typical urban-rural interface. In 1981, a batch of pre-Qin cultural relics were unearthed in this small place called Taigong Temple. Among them, the text on one clock indicates that the owner of the cultural relic is Qin Wugong. Correspondingly, a number of pre-Qin tombs have been discovered in the villages surrounding Taigong Temple. Based on this, some scholars believe that Pingyang, one of the capitals of the Qin State, is located in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ble5aQijKbxbWmMx1IEtv0cvtDc1BvuLImM1CMds.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;617&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/ble5aQijKbxbWmMx1IEtv0cvtDc1BvuLImM1CMds.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131204&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Location map of the four capitals of Qin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Wu Just as his posthumous title suggests, Gong Gong: &quot;Being strong and straightforward is called martial arts, and punishing the people and overcoming them is called martial arts.&quot; Externally, he insisted on using troops to fight against the Western Rong; internally, he killed his three fathers and other powerful ministers to destroy the three tribes. In addition, he was also the first monarch in Qin to practice human sacrifice. After his death, the number of deceased persons reached 66. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it was another initiative of Qin Wugong that really had a significant impact on Qin and later China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the tenth year of Qin Wugong (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;688 BC&lt;/span>;), the Qin State captured the Kweichow (邽) from Xirong. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now Qingshui, Gansu&lt;/span>;), Ji (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Today After the two places in Gansu (Gangu), instead of treating the gains from the expansion of territory as noble fiefs as in the past, they were established as counties and were managed by officials directly sent by the king. From the pre-Qin Dynasty to the present day, for more than two thousand years, counties have been the basic unit of administrative divisions in each era, and the right to invent them belonged to Qin Wugong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the capital of Qin, Pingyang only experienced two generations of monarchs, Xian Gong and Wu Gong. After Wu Gong&#39;s younger brother De Gong came to the throne, he moved the Qin capital from Pingyang to Yongcheng, more than 20 kilometers northwest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/oUEdvSprfqESr8OcmtwAxu9TEwNIeBC9T1PScSIv.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;635&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/oUEdvSprfqESr8OcmtwAxu9TEwNIeBC9T1PScSIv.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131205&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fengxiang East Lake, built for Su Dongpo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On December 16, 1061, Su Dongpo, who had just arrived in Fengxiang for two days to take office as the judge, couldn&#39;t wait to rush to the Confucius Temple to see the long-famous stone drum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stone drum has 10 sides in total, each side is nearly 3 feet high and weighs a thousand kilograms. Today, more than 900 years later, they have gone through many twists and turns and are collected in the Palace Museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each side of the stone drum is engraved with ancient inscriptions, which are called stone drum inscriptions. The owners of the stone drums each have different opinions: Qin Wengong, Qin Xuangong, Qin Mu Gong, Qin Xianggong, Qin Xiangong - no matter which Qin Gong, in short, they are all works of Qin people. The stone drum was unearthed in the south of Fengxiang City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The texts on the stone drums may tell about Qin Gong’s hunting or crossing a river, or describe the beauty and majesty of Qin’s mountains and rivers, or praise the bravery and prowess of Qin’s soldiers - just like pictures of Qin people more than 2,000 years ago. Ukiyo-e. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fengxiang is Yongcheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 677 BC to Duke Xiang of Qin in 677 BC, and 294 years after Qin established its capital Yongcheng, 19 monarchs passed down the throne here from generation to generation. In the past 300 years, the Qin people left countless ruins and relics on the land of Yongcheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Fengxiang is a small city located in the Guanzhong Plain. Leaving the city, the wheat fields are green. In the wilderness five or six kilometers south of the city is the location of the sensational Qin Gong No. 1 Tomb. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon when I went to Qin Gong No. 1 Tomb, there was no one else except the staff guarding the gate. The garden was empty and quiet. Although I have visited a considerable number of ancient tombs, I was still surprised by the grandeur of Qin Gong No. 1 Tomb: the plane of the tomb is in the shape of a Chinese character, the vertical axis of the Chinese character is the east-west slope tomb passage, and the entrance in the middle is the tomb chamber. The entire tomb is 300 meters long, with the tomb chamber nearly 40 meters wide and 25 meters deep. There are three steps left from the construction on the four walls of the tomb, making the entire tomb look like an inverted pyramid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the data, Qin Gong No. 1 Tomb has the largest scale and the most victims excavated so far (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;186 The top five in Chinese archeology, including the highest level of human beings and tomb tools.

According to the text on the excavated stone chime, it is inferred that he should be Qin Jinggong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of seniority, Qin Jinggong was the fourteenth generation ancestor of Qin Shihuang and the fourth generation grandson of Qin Mu Gong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is an idiom called Qin and Jin Zhihao, which generally refers to the marriage between two families. The allusion comes from Duke Mu of Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second monarch after Qin moved its capital to Yongcheng was Qin Xuangong, the eldest son of Qin Degong. At that time, Qin had already gained the upper hand in the war against Xirong. The next step was how to develop eastward and compete with the princes for the world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State of Qin is located on the northwest border. If it wants to develop eastward, the first enemy it must defeat is the State of Jin in the east of the country, which blocks Qin&#39;s road to the Central Plains. However, Jin was a powerful country with great strength. During the reign of Duke Xuan of Qin, Qin and Jin fought for the first time, and Qin won, but it was of no use. When Duke Mu of Qin arrived, Duke Mu changed his national policy, proposed to the state of Jin, and married the daughter of Duke Xian of Jin. After that, he supported the exiled prince Chong&#39;er of the Jin Kingdom, helped him become the king of Jin, and married his daughter to him. In terms of kinship, Duke Mu was previously Chong&#39;er&#39;s brother-in-law, and later became Chong&#39;er&#39;s father-in-law. Chong&#39;er was Duke Wen of Jin, one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of Duke Wen of Jin, the relationship between Qin and Jin broke down and the two sides fell into a long-term war. Although Qin once captured Duke Hui of Jin, Qin&#39;s eastward expansion was still curbed by Jin. The only significant result was that Duke Hui of Jin ceded the land of Hexi to Qin in order to repay Duke Mu of Qin for not killing him. The Qin State pushed its forces to the west bank of the Yellow River for the first time, and the Qin people also saw the turbulent waves of the Yellow River for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Mugong realized that the Qin State could not completely defeat the Jin State, so he turned to launch an offensive against Xirong in the present-day western Gansu, northern Shaanxi, and Ningxia areas: &quot;The twelve benefited the country, opened thousands of miles of land, and then dominated Xirong&quot;. Duke Mu of Qin became one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period after his brother-in-law and son-in-law Duke Wen of Jin. At that time, the territory of the Qin State roughly extended to the Yellow River in the east, to the west of Longshan Mountain in the west, to the present-day Pingliang and Yan&#39;an areas in the north, and to the Qinling Mountains in the south. It covered an area of ​​nearly 100,000 square kilometers, which was equivalent to that of the Jin State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/2mrLbecwzDL45lt1h5nPxWtb7GNltAD33GvPCVjC.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/2mrLbecwzDL45lt1h5nPxWtb7GNltAD33GvPCVjC.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131207&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Babaili Qinchuan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empress Mu Gong , Kang Gong, Gong Gong and Huan Gong who were re-elected successively fought with Jin more than ten times, winning more than losing.

Two years ago, when I went to Jingyang to visit the origin of the earth in China, I planned to visit the site of the Battle of Ma Tunnel, which had affected the fate of the Qin State for many years. However, after consulting local chronicles and asking local people, we were unable to do so - the records in the history books were too vague: Ma Tun, north of Jingyang County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Zhou Wen&quot; in &quot;Gu Wen Guan Zhi&quot; contains an article &quot;Lü Xiang Jue Qin&quot;. This article is related to the Battle of Ma Tun: In 577 BC, the Jin State sent Lu Xiang to defeat Qin. Envoy to the State of Qin, he recounted how the three generations of Qin Duke Mu, Kang Gong, and Gong Gong repeatedly betrayed their alliances, provoked wars, and declared war on the Qin State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the Jin State took the lead in forming a nine-nation coalition including Jin, Qi, Song, Wei, Lu, etc., which went deep into the Qin territory from east to west and fought fiercely at the Ma Tunnel. The Qin army was defeated, and the allied forces crossed the Jinghe River and pursued Hou Li (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;today&#39;s territory of Jingyang&lt;/span>;) before returning home in triumph. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Battle of Ma Tun was one of the few disastrous defeats in the history of the Qin people. The land in Hexi obtained by Qin Mugong was taken away by the Jin State (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;The three families were divided into Jin and then returned to Wei&lt;/span>;). Without the natural protection of the Yellow River, Qin&#39;s territory retreated significantly to the west, and the Qin people&#39;s ideal of eastward expansion encountered a head-on blow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Jinggong, who was sleeping deep in the loess of Tomb No. 1, ascended the throne against the background of losing troops and losing ground in the Battle of Ma Tunnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Jinggong must have felt that Qin was extremely isolated internationally. In order to reverse this situation, he adopted the method of forming an alliance with the Chu State - fundamentally speaking, the Chu people were also descendants of Zhuan Xu and were related by blood to both Qin and Zhao. More importantly, Chu was a viscount, lower than Qin at that time, and had always been regarded as a barbarian by the princes of the Central Plains. The two countries, which were both despised by the princes, hit it off and formed the Qin-Chu Alliance to deal with the Jin-Qi Alliance headed by Jin Qi. Many small countries can only walk a tightrope between the two major alliances - of course, more of them are attached to the Jin-Qi Alliance than to the Qin-Chu Alliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eighteen years after the Battle of Ma Tun, under the leadership of Jin, the princes once again formed a coalition to attack Qin - this time as many as 13 countries. Faced with the threat of a large army, Qin Jinggong adopted the first &quot;chemical warfare&quot; documented in history: when the coalition forces were stationed on the banks of the Jing River, he poisoned the upper reaches. A large number of coalition soldiers were poisoned and died, and they had to withdraw from the Qin territory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 31st year of Qin Jinggong&#39;s appointment as king, the Song Dynasty official Xiang Xu launched a peace movement, which is known in history as Xiang Xu&#39;s annihilation of troops: 14 countries, including Qin and Jin, formed an alliance, stopped the war, and ordered Jin and Chu is the co-overlord. Although Qin and Qi did not aspire to be the hegemons, they were listed as the four great powers along with Jin and Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Repost: Liyang City’s Shocking Reform&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;I found a black stone tablet inscribed with “Liyang City Ruins” at the end of a cornfield beside the road. Above the stone tablet, there is Two crooked electric poles and cables hanging down randomly, like vines that are gradually withering in autumn. At that time, the rain was pouring, and the wilderness far and near was vast. What I recall in my mind is an incredible scene that happened here more than two thousand years ago:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 359 BC, the government erected a 3-foot-long wooden stick at the south gate of Yueyang City. And announced: Whoever carries the stick from the south gate to the north gate will be rewarded 10 gold. Such a short journey, such a light job, such a high salary? The onlookers talked a lot, but no one took the initiative. After a while, the price was increased again: 50 gold. After a long time, someone finally carried the stick to the north gate with the attitude of giving it a try - and sure enough he got 50 gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This allusion is the famous Yimu Lixin. With the strong support of Duke Xiao of Qin, the reform movement presided over by Shang Yang kicked off in Yueyang, the capital of Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/5BpJ7BzTnWGn09ctS1AvIHP1Gz6nFSANYiA9mYKt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;539&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/5BpJ7BzTnWGn09ctS1AvIHP1Gz6nFSANYiA9mYKt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131208&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At the end of 2020, at the Qin and Han Dynasty Yueyang City ruins in Yanliang, Xi&#39;an, archaeologists excavated for the first time a large-scale harem living area in the Qin State palace city ruins in the middle Warring States Period. . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly all the ten generations of Qin kings after Jinggong did not make great achievements, and at most they were regarded as conservative kings. . It was not until the era of Qin Xiangong that Qin ushered in a new rise. Qin Jinggong was the thirteenth generation Qin Jun, and Qin Xiangong was the twenty-fourth generation Qin Jun. There were two full centuries between them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second year after Qin Xiangong came to the throne, he moved the capital to Yueyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liyang is in Yanliang District, northeast of Xi&#39;an today. Geographically speaking, it is located to the north of the Wei River and is the only place that leads from the Guanzhong Plain to the Three Jin Dynasties. It has prosperous commerce and is densely populated. Sima Qian said that it &quot;connects to the three Jin Dynasties in the east and has many merchants&quot; - which seems to be a proof of the commercial prosperity of Liyang. A few years after moving the capital to Liyang, Qin Xiangong &quot;initially acted as a market&quot; - the market was opened in an official form for the first time. Encourage industry and commerce and collect business taxes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While developing the economy, Qin Xiangong strengthened his control over the grassroots. On the one hand, he further implemented the county system, and on the other hand, he organized the country&#39;s population into one group for every five families, requiring the people to supervise each other and implement joint sitting. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 21st year of Duke Xian of Qin (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;364 BC&lt;/span>;), the Qin army crossed the Yellow River eastward and penetrated deeply into the Kingdom of Wei ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the 5th century BC, the three families were divided into the Jin Dynasty, and the Jin Kingdom was divided into the three kingdoms of Wei, Zhao and Han&lt;/span>;). The Wei army was defeated at Shimen and beheaded. 60000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liyang has been the capital of Qin for only more than thirty years, with a generation and a half of kings - Duke Xiang of Qin and his son Duke Xiao of Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of the rise of the Qin State, Qin Xiaogong was a key figure of great importance. Jia Yi said: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Qin Xiaogong held the land of Weihan and held the land of Yongzhou. The monarchs and ministers stood firm to get a glimpse of the Zhou Dynasty. He swept the world and included the whole country. , encompassing the meaning of the four seas and the heart of the eight wastelands.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaogong had a spirit of introspection. He realized that the Qin State was remote in the northwest and had no say in the world. The state of Qin was not even qualified to participate. &quot;The princes despise Qin, and there is nothing more ugly than that.&quot; So, he ordered to seek talents; so Shang Yang came to Qin and launched a series of reforms that changed history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian summarized the content of Shang Yang&#39;s reform in one sentence: &quot;Reform laws and amend punishments, cultivate crops at home, and encourage rewards and punishments for dying in war.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, Shang Yang&#39;s reform The most important thing is two words: agricultural war. Farming is agriculture, war is military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Yang’s success lies in his grasping the core of the problem, which is that Qin Xiaogong hopes to use simple, easy-to-operate, and quick-effective methods to create a vibrant Qin State like a magician. . Focusing on agriculture guarantees the economy; focusing on military affairs is the hardest principle in an era where the law of the jungle is respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, synchronizing with the reform and modification of punishments was the harsh system of joint sitting and informing - this was continuously strengthened by several generations of Qin monarchs; synchronizing with the emphasis on agriculture was the attack on businessmen. That is, focusing on agriculture and suppressing commerce. Not only merchants must be severely punished, but even the occasional commercial activities of the people are strictly prohibited; &quot;rewards and punishments of death for foreigners to persuade others to fight&quot; certainly made the Qin army braver, but the Qin State gradually degenerated into a bloodthirsty &quot;shangshou&quot; A country with &quot;great merit&quot;: the Qin army has one camp commander for every five people and one general for every one hundred people. During the war, all generals and commanders would be executed if they did not capture the enemy&#39;s head. If 33 heads are obtained and the standard is met, the generals and commanders will be promoted to the first level. When besieging an enemy city, capture more than 8,000 heads and meet the standard; capture more than 2,000 heads in the field and meet the standard; generals at all levels can receive rewards. The Qin army, which relies on its title to motivate and stimulate, is obviously not something the princes can resist with its crazy bloodthirst. Civilization lost to barbarism because barbarism can defy human morality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From today&#39;s perspective, Shang Yang&#39;s reforms can certainly make a country rich and powerful in the short term, but if it is adopted as a long-term national policy, it is destined to lead the country to disaster. For example, if you want to temporarily save a seriously ill patient&#39;s life, you can use strong medicine; but if you use strong medicine for a long time, it will not only fail to cure the disease, but will kill him. ——In the era of Qin Shihuang, the basic national policy of that year was still implemented. It enabled Qin to finally unify the world, but it failed to prevent the Qin Dynasty from escaping the short-lived cycle of rapid prosperity and sudden collapse. The reason is that Shang Yang&#39;s reform was too strong a medicine. A normal country could not withstand such a strong medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of Duke Xiao, Shang Yang was liquidated by the nobles of the Qin State and sentenced to death by being broken into pieces. However, the laws formulated by him were still faithfully implemented in the Qin State. Han Feizi said: &quot;Shang Yang died, but Qin Fa was not defeated.&quot; Indeed, although Shang Yang himself died tragically, the new laws he formulated back then were still followed in the Qin State and laid a solid foundation for Qin Shihuang to unify China. In fact, not only did Shang Yang&#39;s new laws survive in the Qin State, but Shang Yang&#39;s shadow can also be seen at any time in other eras in the history of old China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is thought-provoking is that the rise of Qin not only failed to improve Qin’s international image, but made it even worse: before Shang Yang’s reform, Qin was regarded as a barbarian by the princes because of its remoteness, isolation and backward culture. After Shang Yang&#39;s reform, the country of Yi and Di was not only looked down upon but also reputed to be greedy for profit, dishonest, violent and brutal. The princes called it the violent Qin or the Qin of tigers and wolves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The monarchs and ministers of the Qin State, who were dedicated to becoming bigger and stronger, disdained these noisy voices. At this time, the Qin State was like a chariot that had started and was rumbling towards the battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Together: six kings, one in the world&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While Shang Yang was carrying out vigorous reforms in Yueyang, he was also building another city in the heart of the Guanzhong Plain, two hundred miles southwest of Yueyang. That will be the future capital of the Qin State, and it will also be the end point of the Qin State and the Qin Dynasty that was upgraded from the Qin State - Xianyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is an overpass on the Xi&#39;an Ring Expressway called Afang Palace, and inside it is the ruins of Afang Palace. An &quot;Ode to Afang Palace&quot; written by Du Mu of the Tang Dynasty made this palace of the Qin Dynasty, which had been in disintegration for many years, famous and became almost synonymous with the Qin Dynasty and its capital Xianyang. However, in essence, Afang Palace was built in the 35th year of Qin Shihuang. Only two years later, Qin Shihuang died on the East Patrol Road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moved from Yueyang to Xianyang, the capital and palace of Qin were built more than 20 miles away from the later Epang Palace - one of them was north of the Wei River and the other was south of the Wei River. Regarding Weibei, it was probably Du Fu&#39;s saying &quot;Spring trees in Weibei, sunset clouds in the east of the Yangtze&quot; that left a good impression on me. Therefore, when I saw the falling poplar leaves in Weibei in late autumn, I was a little disappointed. . The Qindu ruins in Xianyang are located on a vast loess plateau, high up and far away. The palaces of two thousand years ago have been turned into cultivated land and woods. There are occasionally some abrupt terraces, which are probably the foundations of the palaces back then. The loess ditch under the platform is dotted with some residential houses. A few sheep are gnawing in the grass in front of and behind the houses. The vicissitudes of the human world are beyond the understanding of these poor animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the capital of the Qin Dynasty, from Qin Xiaogong to Qin Shihuang, seven generations of Qin kings strategized in Xianyang. After years of bloody battles, they were finally unified; as the capital of the Qin Dynasty, from Qin Shihuang to Qin II, it was only It has been in ruins for more than ten years. Qin Shihuang envisioned two generations, three generations, and even thousands of generations from the first emperor. However, the ideal is very full, and the reality is very skinny: from the Qin Dynasty in Feiziyi to the unification of China by Qin Shihuang, it took the Ying family more than 600 years to conquer the world, but it took the Ying family more than 600 years to conquer the world. Only 14 years. The reasons for the rise in 600 years and the collapse in 14 years have been clearly summarized by the ancients: &quot;If benevolence and righteousness are not applied, the offensive and defensive forces will be different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaogong moved the capital from Liyang to Xianyang , the biggest factor is that Xianyang is located in the center of the Qin State and is close to the Wei River, with convenient transportation-along the Wei River, Qin&#39;s troops and supplies can enter the Yellow River and conquer eastward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years after moving the capital to Xianyang, the Qin State, which had become stronger through reforms, was sharpening its sword. In this year, when the feuding state of Wei had just been defeated by the state of Qi, Shang Yang personally led an army across the river to attack Wei. He also used his old friendship with one of the Wei army&#39;s generals, Gongzi Xian, to trap him in the name of an alliance. He defeated the Wei army and regained the lost territory that had been lost for many years. The land in Hexi has realized Qin Xiaogong&#39;s ideal of &quot;restoring the homeland of Duke Mu&quot; when he came to the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Qin Xiaogong, the five Qin kings, King Huiwen, King Wu, King Zhaoxiang, King Xiaowen and King Zhuangxiang, appeared one after another and continued to encroach on the princes. Among them, King Huiwen and King Zhaoxiang were the most prominent: during King Huiwen&#39;s time, he attacked the Wei State to the east and occupied Hexi and Shangjun. The Yellow River&#39;s natural barrier and the Weihan Fortress were firmly in the hands of the Qin people; he went to the southwest to destroy the Ba Kingdom and the Wei Han Fortress. Shu Kingdom; go northwest and capture the 25 cities of Yiqu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Zhaoxiang reigned for 58 years and was the longest-serving monarch in Qin. He launched dozens of conquests, and his war god Bai Qi wiped out more than 1 million princes&#39; armies in just four wars - the total population of the world at that time was estimated to be only 20 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to deal with Qin, the princes organized 4 or 5 coalition forces in the name of unity. However, as Jia Yi said: STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The people of Qin opened and closed the door to delay the enemy, and the divisions of the nine kingdoms patrolled and did not dare to advance. Qin had no money to lose, but the princes of the world were already trapped.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/73oVHZiw76YNjTGCGgOBov7SXuO9V4FiLZLf1PTp.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/73oVHZiw76YNjTGCGgOBov7SXuO9V4FiLZLf1PTp.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131209&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text- align: center;&quot;>;The statue of Qin Shihuang in Qinhuangdao where he sought immortality&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Newton has a famous saying: I can see Far away because I stand on the shoulders of giants. To paraphrase: Qin Shihuang was able to unify the world because he stood on the foundation of his ancestors. Jia Yi summed it up as: &quot;Up to the time of the First Emperor, the remaining warriors of the sixth generation vigorously promoted the strategy and controlled the inner world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ying Zheng became the new generation of Qin Jun, he was still a 13-year-old young boy with great power. It&#39;s in Lu Buwei&#39;s hands. In 238 BC, 23-year-old Ying Zheng came to Yongcheng to hold a coronation ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s, archaeologists discovered a Warring States architectural relic in Changqing Township, Fengxiang County. One of the tiles had four words on it: Qinian Gongdang. &quot;Qi&quot; is connected with &quot;Qi&quot;, and praying for good harvest means praying to heaven for a good harvest. According to historical records, Qinian Palace was built by Duke Mu, and Ying Zheng&#39;s coronation ceremony was held here. More important than the coronation ceremony, Ying Zheng was in Yongcheng and pacified Lao Ai, who was causing trouble in Xianyang. The following year, Lu Buwei was sentenced to death. From then on, he had sole power and all government orders were issued by himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beginning in 230 BC, the Qin State launched a war of unification with overwhelming force: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 230 BC, Korea was destroyed;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 229 BC , destroyed Zhao;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 225 BC, destroyed Wei;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 224 BC, destroyed Chu;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 222 BC, destroyed Yan and Dai;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;In 221 BC, Qi was destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this point, Kyushu was cleared and the whole country was unified. In the scorching smoke of gunpowder, the Great Qin Kingdom was upgraded to the Great Qin Empire, and King Qin Yingzheng was upgraded to the First Emperor of Qin. A unified empire with a territory far beyond that of previous generations appeared for the first time in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Shihuang ordered that the weapons of the world be confiscated and melted down to make 12 golden figures each weighing a thousand stones (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Pre-Qin Dynasty) Copper is called gold or auspicious gold&lt;/span>;). The tall golden man stands outside the gate of Qin Palace, bathing in the bloody morning sun rising from the Guanzhong Plain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time a prince was eliminated, Qin Shihuang ordered his palace to be rebuilt on the shore of the Wei River as it was. Soon, &quot;the palace was separated from the palace, looking at each other on the road, and it was forgotten in the old years, and it could not be restored.&quot; While most of the cities in other vassal states were almost in ruins due to years of war, Xianyang was the only one standing out, its prosperity and magnificence were like a myth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ying Zheng, who regards himself as the First Emperor, has reason to believe that the Ying family will be united forever and the war will be destroyed forever. As a result, &quot;the heart of a single man becomes increasingly arrogant and stubborn.&quot; Unexpectedly, God&#39;s will is hard to predict. Only 3 years after his death, the thousands of miles of mountains and rivers he and his ancestors built were wiped out. The people of Qin and the Ying family also came to an end amidst the angry shouts of &quot;The world has been suffering from Qin for a long time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/BUAAaVGywg0OkSi1LVFI4tX3Kv2ZOZxPeqcbcX5B.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/01/30/BUAAaVGywg0OkSi1LVFI4tX3Kv2ZOZxPeqcbcX5B.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;131210&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Afanggong Ruins Park&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xianyang, as the Qin Dynasty It was the capital of China and the Qin Dynasty for nearly a century and a half. In the third year of the second year of Qin Dynasty (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;207 BC&lt;/span>;), Xiang Yu invaded Xianyang. The prophecy of &quot;Although Chu has three households, the fall of Qin will surely lead to Chu&quot; Become reality. Most of this majestic city and its palaces were destroyed. &quot;The Chu people burned the fire and the earth was pitifully scorched.&quot; Since then, the mountains and rivers have been washed away, and prosperity has been hard to come back. Xianyang has completely become an ordinary small western town. Hundreds of years later, at the end of the Tang Dynasty, a poet named Xu Hun climbed onto the Xianyang Tower.

Later, he called the police, was hospitalized, paid, and was discharged from the hospital. The perpetrator did not come forward.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 26, the Fengcheng City Public Security Bureau Traffic Police Brigade responded on the platform that at about 8:50 on September 14, at the intersection of Jiefang South Road and Jianyi Avenue in Fengcheng City, the license plate number was The police car of GanC**** police collided with the complainant&#39;s unlicensed three-wheel electric vehicle, causing the complainant to be injured. On September 26, 2023, the brigade issued a traffic accident liability determination letter for the accident, and convened both parties to the accident for accident mediation on the complainant&#39;s personal injury compensation. The two parties reached an agreement, and the complainant expressed satisfaction with the result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the netizen’s message, this was an ordinary traffic accident. However, keywords such as &quot;police car&quot;, &quot;driving away directly after the accident&quot; and &quot;did not show up for follow-up treatment&quot; as mentioned in the comments by netizens obviously gave the accident a different meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 70 of the Road Traffic Safety Law stipulates that when a traffic accident occurs on the road, the driver of the vehicle shall stop immediately to protect the scene; if personal injury or death is caused, the driver of the vehicle shall immediately rescue the injured person and promptly rescue the injured person. Report to the traffic police on duty or the traffic management department of the public security organ. If the police car causing the accident fails to perform these duties, or even leaves the scene directly after the accident, it will inevitably cause dissatisfaction and doubts among the victims. As law enforcers, you should have a higher awareness of law-abiding than ordinary people, instead of ignoring the safety of others. This not only damages the honor and image of the police, but also embodies a strong sense of privilege behind their actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should also be pointed out that the behavior of the police car was suspected of a traffic hit and run. According to Article 112 of the &quot;Regulations on Procedures for Handling Road Traffic Accidents&quot;: &quot;Traffic hit-and-run&quot; refers to the behavior of parties involved in a road traffic accident who, in order to evade legal liability, drive or abandon a vehicle to flee the scene of the road traffic accident or abscond and hide. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 31 this year, a court police car in Eryuan County, Yunnan Province left after a traffic accident. After the incident was exposed, it triggered heated discussions among netizens. According to a report from the Eryuan County Court, three people including Li Mouliang, a judicial police officer from the court, went to the Eryuan County Detention Center to perform official duties that day. During the meeting with a truck, they had a side scrape, causing varying degrees of damage to both vehicles. The Traffic Police Brigade of the Eryuan County Public Security Bureau issued the &quot;Road Traffic Accident Determination&quot; and &quot;Public Security Traffic Management Administrative Penalty Decision&quot;, confirming that Li Mouliang was fully responsible for the accident, and Li Mouliang&#39;s illegal behavior of escaping after the traffic accident did not constitute a crime. Administrative penalties include a fine of 1,000 yuan and 6 points on the driver&#39;s license. The court has criticized and educated Li Mouliang, ordered him to conduct a deep review, and will deal with him in accordance with relevant regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Fengcheng City police car hit a person and then left. Is his behavior considered a hit-and-run? When the police car left in a hurry, was it because of drunk driving? What kind of investigation did the Fengcheng City Traffic Police Department conduct on this matter, and how did it deal with the responsibilities of the police cars? From the response of Fengcheng City Traffic Police Department, we did not see this information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second doubt about the incident is that the traffic accident occurred on September 14, but the traffic accident liability certificate was not issued until the 26th. Article 62 of the &quot;Regulations on Procedures for Handling Road Traffic Accidents&quot; stipulates: The traffic management department of the public security organ shall prepare a road traffic accident determination letter within ten days from the date of on-site investigation. If inspection or appraisal is required, a road traffic accident determination certificate shall be produced within five days from the date of confirmation of the inspection report and appraisal opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the above regulations, if inspection, appraisal, etc. are involved, the issuance of the road traffic accident certification may be delayed because it requires a certain time limit. Then, the Fengcheng City Traffic Police Department should explain in detail whether the accident involved inspection or identification. If the above matters were not involved, why was it not until netizens exposed it that the traffic accident liability determination was issued? The Fengcheng City Traffic Police Department did not issue a traffic accident determination certificate on time in compliance with regulations. It is no wonder that many netizens questioned it. Some netizens even asked whether the &quot;leader&quot; was involved in the police car that caused the accident, which caused the delay in the accident liability determination? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please don’t blame netizens for their rich associations. Regarding the incident of “police car hitting and injuring someone and then leaving directly”, the local traffic police department’s various deficiencies in the handling results are inconsistent with common sense and legal principles, and are inconsistent with the public’s understanding of this matter. There is also a clear gap in the expected information disclosure and fair processing. The police car at the scene and the belated traffic accident certificate should not remain a mystery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, in recent years, incidents involving one party claiming to have a &quot;background&quot; in traffic accidents and interfering with the handling of the traffic police department have occurred frequently. The more &quot;family members&quot; are involved, the stricter the public&#39;s scrutiny of such traffic accidents. They also expect the traffic police department to enforce the law impartially and the results can withstand the test of law and public opinion. The local traffic police department should respond to the above doubts that netizens are concerned about as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[历史十字路口，普拉昌达如何建设“新尼泊尔”？丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257928]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/29/m24cPR1E5QwjQ4DMESUY6SH0SUBng6zSBqoEvnmA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;695&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/m24cPR1E5QwjQ4DMESUY6SH0SUBng6zSBq oEvnmA. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252811&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 21, 2023 local time, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the United States, Prime Minister of Nepal Rachanda delivered a speech at the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From September 23 to 30, 2023, Nepalese Prime Minister Prachanda paid an official visit to China . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is Prachanda’s view on Nepal’s diplomacy, neighboring relations and the entire world situation? What is the connotation of the &quot;New Nepal&quot; vision proposed by Prachanda? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answers to the above questions will be helpful for a comprehensive understanding of Prachanda’s ideological and political process in the past ten years, as well as the possible future political direction of Nepal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the &quot;Selected Speeches of Prime Minister Prachanda of Nepal&quot; edited and translated by the Institute of South Asia of Sichuan University, a key research base of the Ministry of Education, will be published soon. The book includes Prachanda&#39;s speeches in 2015 —25 speeches in 2023 during his political career in the past ten years, answering the above questions. Most of the speeches included in the anthology cover Prachanda&#39;s speeches in the Nepali Parliament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not only a commemoration of Prachanda’s visit to China, but also a testimony to the vigorous development of China-Nepal friendly relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Historical Transformations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What kind of Nepal does Prachanda want to build? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prachanda has repeatedly praised the success of the Nepali people in their movement against the autocratic monarchy. He defined this shift as &quot;the largest shift in history&quot; &quot;heralding the last shift in a new era of peace, stability and prosperity&quot; and &quot;building history according to the needs of history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a decade of civil war, Prachanda wants Nepal to go (or run) on the track of economic development and construction, hoping to end an era of chaos and poverty. His desire for development and prosperity made him a visionary leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we stand at the crossroads of history and look back on the past, it is easy for us to be confused: whether Nepal has truly benefited from these historical achievements. For this reason, as the core political figure of this period, Prime Minister Prachanda has also been questioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why has Nepal still not achieved the stability and prosperity it promised? Why are economic and social plans not implemented effectively? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some articles raised questions about Prime Minister Prachanda&#39;s previous commitments and vision. Because even after taking office several times, these promises and visions have not all been implemented. However, from the articles in this book that span a relatively long time, we may be able to see its original intention, practical helplessness, and future ambitions and plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Self-evident strategic position&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The geopolitical landscape of South Asia is changing. As the largest economy in the region, India adheres to the &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; and always tends to be brothers with its surrounding small economies. India regards South Asia as its own backyard, and no other country can get involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as China is growing into a powerful country with widespread influence around the world, India is unable to compete with it and cannot continue to adhere to its policy stance in South Asia. Therefore, India agrees to the US presence in South Asia, which is imperative for the US to advance its long-term strategy of containing China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, Nepal&#39;s foreign policy is largely affected by the changing international situation. The United States very much wants Nepal to be part of its strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1970s, the United States used Nepal to create border problems. Today, the United States is dictating to Nepal at all costs to force it to pass the Millennium Challenge Plan. U.S. officials came one after another to put pressure on Nepali leaders in Kathmandu and once again asked them to adopt the Military Operations Charter. From the implementation level of the US &quot;Indo-Pacific Strategy&quot;, a crucial point is to firmly control Nepal. The &quot;Millennium Challenge Plan&quot; and subsequent military plans are undoubtedly part of the United States&#39; &quot;Indo-Pacific Strategy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Modi government gave up its status as a founding member of the &quot;Non-Aligned Movement&quot; and joined the Western Alliance led by the United States. The situation in South Asia has changed. Therefore, even in Nepal, which advocates independence, the direction of diplomacy has been forced to change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, the United States mainly relied on India, or at least coordinated with Nepal and India in terms of policy. Today, the dominant position of the United States is very prominent and India&#39;s role has been weakened. This situation has deepened the contradictions and confusion among Nepali leadership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although &quot;balanced foreign policy&quot; is the declared position of most Nepali leaders, they also tend to get stuck in the quagmire of great power politics. In this case, some of them are complacent about being included in the alliance backed by India and led by the United States. Therefore, the geopolitical competition between Nepal and South Asia is no longer just regional, but an important part of global geopolitics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Balanced Diplomacy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Maintaining diplomatic balance is the primary condition for Nepal&#39;s political stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A series of diplomatic speeches made by Prachanda during his tenure as Prime Minister also mainly focused on trilateral cooperation with China and India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Shah dynasty (not just the Malla dynasty), Nepal has maintained a balanced relationship between its two giant neighbors, and it can maintain it as long as it maintains friendly relations with China and India. Safe and powerful. But sometimes, the different civilizations, different political systems, and different diplomatic positionings of the two neighboring countries can push Nepal into an uneasy situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tensions in Sino-Indian relations will put Nepal on the edge of vulnerability. It is important for Nepali politicians to master the art of maintaining a balance between the two poles. In a series of public speeches, Prachanda declared that &quot;the era of labeling as pro-India or pro-China is over&quot; and &quot;we are neither pro-China nor pro-India, we are pro-Nepal&quot; and insisted on turning Nepal into a communication channel The bridge between China and India. His &quot;pro-Nepal&quot; foreign policy is based on maintaining balance, mutual trust and friendly relations with both neighboring countries and all friendly countries. On this basis, the interconnection between countries is not only the infrastructure, but also the communication of ideas, markets and hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Nepal, it is crucial to maintain common and friendly relations with China and India. This is not only related to Nepal&#39;s prosperity, development and stability, but also related to Nepal&#39;s status as an independent and sovereign country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, there are two major obstacles hindering friendly relations between the three parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the emergence of right-wing Hindu nationalist leadership in India and its pursuit of the West has obscured the friendly relations between the three neighboring countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the paralysis of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and India&#39;s negative actions in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) have opened the way for external powers to intervene in South Asian affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of changes in the global geopolitical landscape, the deeper concerns expressed by Western countries about Nepal cannot be ignored. For Western countries or any arrogant power, land is extremely important. No matter how big Nepal is, Western countries will spare no effort to include Nepal in their geopolitical alliances. As Professor Li Tao, the editor-in-chief of this book, said: &quot;As the United States intensifies its implementation of the &#39;Indo-Pacific Strategy&#39; and advances its strategic encirclement of our country&#39;s (China&#39;s) neighboring countries, Nepal&#39;s geostrategic status is self-evident.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Every time the Prime Minister of Nepal takes office, he will continue the tradition of visiting two neighboring countries and demonstrate the good relations between Nepal and neighboring countries through this approach. Prachanda&#39;s visit to China with senior leaders of various countries during the Hangzhou Asian Games is not only a continuation of this diplomatic tradition, but also of great significance in expanding Nepal&#39;s international influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prachanda has long advocated that the three neighboring countries maintain peaceful and friendly relations, but the intervention of foreign powers has made this proposal not easy. The people of Nepal have never imagined that Nepal, the &quot;Land of Peace&quot;, would be forced to become a battleground between great powers. They believe that a strong desire for peace, development, prosperity and progress can play a key role in the struggle to prevent imperialism and power politics. effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, Nepal (especially the Kathmandu Valley) relied on northern trade as its economic basis, but due to geographical difficulties and weak infrastructure, northern border trade was greatly restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In today&#39;s era of rapid advancement in science and technology, these are no longer insurmountable obstacles. For the Chinese who grew up reading the story &quot;The Foolish Old Man Moves the Mountains&quot;, the mountains separating Nepal and China will never become an obstacle to the development of relations between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Author: Niraj Lawoju, doctoral student at Sichuan University; Translator: Wang Jing, associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences)&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; >;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/ a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[洗小龙虾被扎手后离世，看完海鲜界隐藏的“杀手”我瑟瑟发抖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257653]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/ad6c78c463628aa887a857a4ffa251c4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;4642&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/25/ad6c78c463628aa887a857a4ffa251c4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252080&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 25/a34dd0451df96cebb5e6aff7a03aeda4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;4973&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/a34dd0451df96cebb5e6aff7a03aeda4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252082&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ c6df904d2b752b5d31dce3c0233e7a93.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;5405&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 25/c6df904d2b752b5d31dce3c0233e7a93.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252081&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被脱发缠住的年轻人：秃不秃头，并不妨碍爱与被爱]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257902]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/28/W2lqVDuCFgVGZ7i21WBM4N9BYYD20bXWeGQs28Eg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/W2lqVDuCFgVGZ7i21WBM4N9BYYD20 bXWeGQs28Eg. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252661&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters randomly interviewed many &quot;bald young men&quot; with pathological hair loss. It is believed that staying up late, anxiety and chronic stress are important contributors to hair loss. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first severe hair loss started from the top of the head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A wide slit opens in the middle of the head, and gradually spreads to the left and right sides, turning into an oval. A large area of ​​scalp is exposed, and then spreads uncontrollably. The hair in other places begins to become soft and yellow. , in the end, the hair is like a mature dandelion, falling off with the slightest touch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As long as you sit down for a while, you will find that there are fallen hairs on the chair, arms, and clothes.&quot; Greedy said. Eight years ago, 20-year-old Gretchen started her own business overseas. In the three months before the trial opening of the store, she was in a high-pressure state of mental stress and physical exhaustion every day. McDonald&#39;s at three in the morning became her most frequent restaurant. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hair loss is the trace left on her body by this day and night hard work. As a daily lingo among young people, &quot;bald-headed&quot; is not only a description of appearance, but also a state of exhaustion in work and life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;25-35 years old, male, working in the IT industry, these three labels delineate the target group of hair transplant customers that Wang Xiaoping, director of Damai Microneedle Hair Transplantation Technology Research Institute, has the most contact with. According to CCTV News, a survey on people with hair loss released by the National Health Commission showed that the number of people with hair loss in my country has exceeded 250 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The high pressure and fast pace of modern life have promoted the trend of younger hair loss from the environmental level. Taking common androgenic alopecia as an example, high mental stress, staying up late, and excessive exercise may all lead to Increased androgen levels will have a negative impact on hair follicles, leading to progressive miniaturization of hair follicles, which is manifested as hair gradually becoming thinner, softer or even falling off.&quot; Liu Yi, deputy chief physician at the Dermatology Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Stress and staying up late &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; are &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;directly reflected on the hair&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After 35 years old Having just joined a pharmaceutical company as a sales assistant, &quot;older newcomer&quot; Fan Fan felt that everything was too difficult. One person is responsible for various data statistics and administrative management of a sales team of more than 100 people. She works overtime until late at night every day. When she was infected with the new coronavirus for the first time, she only took less than a day&#39;s rest before continuing to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fan Fan doesn’t dare to make mistakes, but no one is willing to spend time teaching him. The huge workload led to frequent mistakes, which often caused her to be stared at and scolded loudly. She did not dare to bring negative emotions to the workplace, &quot;for fear of being unemployed again at this age.&quot; In the end, all the anger was reserved for the family - &quot;I will yell at the child even if she calls her mother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, 37-year-old Fan Fan decided to resign naked. Two months later, her hairdresser informed her that she had alopecia areata on the top of her head. &quot;Long-term bad mood, insomnia, panic, and gastroenteritis made me realize that I had a serious problem. I decided to resign under the pressure of difficulty in re-employment. However, I soon fell into the anxiety of being unemployed again. I didn&#39;t expect that I would be unemployed again. Encountered alopecia areata.&quot; Fan Fan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;China Alopecia Areata Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (2019)&quot; issued by the Chinese Medical Association, alopecia areata is a hair follicle-specific autoimmune disease caused by the combined effect of genetic factors and environmental factors, which is manifested by the sudden onset of clear-cut borders on the scalp. circular patchy hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, scholars such as Guo Hongwei from the Department of Dermatology at the Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical University investigated the correlation between stressful life events and the risk of alopecia areata. The study showed that mental stress plays a significant role in the onset of alopecia areata. , sleep changes are the most dangerous factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many &quot;bald young men&quot; who suffered from pathological hair loss randomly interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters all believed that staying up late, anxiety and chronic stress were important contributors to their hair loss. At a deeper level, it may be explained by the contemporary German philosopher Han Bingzhe&#39;s description of modern society as a &quot;merit society&quot; - people willingly fall into self-exploitation in a highly competitive environment and are exhausted in their efforts to realize their own value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Yu, who loves to play &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;, &quot;particularly cares about winning or losing the game.&quot; After losing, he always wants to wait until he wins before the game ends. He stays up until four or five in the morning to fall asleep almost every day; designer Jiao Jiao She often goes to bed at three o&#39;clock in the middle of the night. When interviewed by a Southern Weekend reporter, she could not fall asleep until five or six o&#39;clock in the morning for a month. Aric, a software engineer, encounters unsolvable problems at work and becomes anxious and nervous to the point of insomnia. According to his observation, nearly half of the programmers around him are suffering from hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she suffered massive hair loss, 24-year-old Tian Luo was the store manager of a real estate agency store in Shanghai. Her daily working hours were from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. the next day, with six days off and one day off. Even on her only day off, Tian Luo couldn&#39;t truly rest as she had to deal with customer complaints and other work at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the year of graduation, Tian Luo came to the &quot;dream Shanghai&quot; from Yunnan, won the first place in regional sales performance from scratch, and was promoted to manager in two years. But like countless young people who feel confused in their struggle, Tian Luo suddenly felt that she had lost her sensitivity to everything around her. &quot;I only had work, performance pressure and staying up late in my eyes, which were directly reflected in my hair.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;If I just met you&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; and I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;are bald&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;can’t choose you. As the other half&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The adolescence Chan Chan had shoulder-length hair. Since she started losing her hair, she has cut her hair shorter and shorter, keeping it above the chin all year round. She also lost 10 hairs, and long hair would visually cause a greater psychological burden on her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of hair loss, the 1.65-meter-tall Grean Chan habitually walks at the highest point in the group. &quot;If you stand on the escalator first (when the elevator goes down) or stand on a lower step, and the people next to you can see the top of your head, I will try to stand behind you and stand higher than others.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Medically, hair loss is usually divided into seven levels. Level 7 is the most severe severe hair loss, and Greedy was diagnosed with level 6. &quot;At that time, it was impossible to socialize at all. Whether I saw a rainbow, a shooting star, or any other occasion where I could make a wish, I would sincerely pray. My birthday wish every year is to make my hair grow back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Severe Along with the hair loss came a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. In his early twenties, Greedy often thought: What is so precious about youth? I&#39;d better live to be fifty as soon as possible, so that when others my age start to go bald, I won&#39;t look different from others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ganchan and her boyfriend met in their freshman year. She was glad that her hair was not as thick as her scalp at that time. Although the other party never expressed concern about hair to Greedy, once, her boyfriend admitted, &quot;If you were like you are now (bald) when we first met, I really wouldn&#39;t be able to choose you as my other partner.&quot; half&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he is most emotionally depressed, Greedy will blame all his unsatisfactory life and work on his hair loss. Sometimes I quarrel with my boyfriend, and I can&#39;t help but think to myself, &quot;If I had hair and wasn&#39;t as ugly as I am now, maybe he wouldn&#39;t quarrel with me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Mobius strip&quot; of interaction between body and mind may help us better understand the relationship between hair loss and stress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The diseases that negative emotions bring to the body are called psychosomatic diseases in the medical field - physical and organic diseases in which psychosocial factors play an important role in the onset and development. If the internal genetic factors causing hair loss are regarded as bullets, anxiety and internal friction are like triggers, which are important triggers that promote and aggravate the phenomenon of hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Physical illness in turn aggravates negative emotions, which can be called a physical and mental reaction, that is, physical illness becomes a psychological stressor and affects mental health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is an interaction between physical health and mental health. This is because the human body’s nervous system, endocrine system and immune system interact with each other to jointly maintain the stability of the body’s internal environment. This interaction is a physiological and An important research area in the medical field is called the bio-psycho-social model. Many disfiguring skin diseases may cause patients to have anxiety, depression or self-esteem problems, which may lead to immune regulation disorders and further aggravate physical diseases.&quot; Liu Yi said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A survey on anxiety and depression in patients with common psychosomatic skin diseases, published in &quot;Journal of Southeast University (Medical Edition)&quot;, showed that 17% of patients with skin diseases have psychological disorders that co-occur with their skin diseases. question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Shaofang, executive director and deputy CEO of Damai Hair Transplant Medical Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that the post-90s generation, who have become the main force in hair loss, often suffer from low self-esteem due to hair loss, which affects work and spouse selection. “Many people seeking hair transplant treatment The real desire of patients with hair loss is to build self-confidence, which prompts us to pay more attention to the mental health of people with hair loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I&#39;m afraid that after I stop taking the medicine, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;the hair that grew out before will also &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; fall out&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;September 24, 2023, is the 378th day that Lan Pingping insists on using minoxidil. In more than a year, she experienced three &quot;crazy hair loss periods&quot;. Each time she washed her hair, she lost one to two hundred strands, which lasted about 20 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After long-term use of minoxidil, Lan Pingping found that her whole body had become hirsutious, and her scalp also had acne from time to time, but she never thought about stopping. The hair that came out also fell out.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interviews with reporters from Southern Weekend, almost all hair loss patients admitted that they have used common anti-hair loss products on the market, including but not limited to anti-hair loss shampoos, laser hair growth caps, scalp essences, massage combs, and five-part anti-hair loss products. Black powder, black sesame balls, etc. Among them, the most commonly mentioned is minoxidil hair growth solution administered as an over-the-counter drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Minoxidil was originally a drug used to treat high blood pressure, but was accidentally discovered to promote hair growth. Liu Yi believes that there is some abuse of minoxidil due to promotion by e-commerce platforms and self-media. Although minoxidil is relatively safe, it may also cause some side effects, such as local allergies or irritation reactions, hirsutism, etc., and in a few cases, it may even cause a drop in blood pressure, tachycardia, etc. Therefore, its application is best carried out under the guidance of a doctor to avoid abuse and overdose to ensure safety and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;First, minoxidil is a therapeutic drug, and it is not necessary to use it for the purpose of preventing hair loss when hair loss does not occur; second, although androgenic alopecia is the main cause of hair loss, Causes, but telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, etc. are also very common, and some patients may be accompanied by other underlying diseases, so the type of hair loss should be judged by a doctor before treatment. For example, diffuse alopecia areata, the clinical manifestations can be similar to androgenic alopecia, but used alone Minoxidil is usually not very effective,&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a long illness, Greanman often reads research papers in the field of hair loss and thinks he has tried almost every anti-hair loss product on the market. She has bought five to six thousand yuan of supplements from domestic micro-businessmen that claim to &quot;radically cure hair loss&quot;, and has also spent 10,000 yuan to buy imported 650 nanometer laser hair caps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, some high-priced products actually have low raw materials and are just an &quot;IQ tax&quot; labeled &quot;anti-hair loss&quot;. Most products have limited help in hair growth, and it is difficult to produce visible hair loss when used alone. Visible hair growth effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulations&quot; that will be implemented in 2021, the original hair growth cosmetics category will be cancelled. Hair growth cosmetics that have obtained the &quot;National Cosmetic Special Label&quot; in the past will be classified as &quot;hair growth cosmetics&quot; after a five-year transition period. Stop production and sales. Newly added anti-hair loss cosmetics are registered and managed as &quot;special purpose cosmetics&quot; and require efficacy testing at a cosmetics administrative licensing inspection agency. They can be produced and sold only after approval by the State Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yi believes that the popularity of anti-hair loss products shows that the current hair loss problem still faces huge unmet clinical needs. &quot;For androgenic alopecia, the most common type of hair loss, currently only two drugs, finasteride and minoxidil, are approved for treatment in China. However, some patients have poor efficacy, coupled with safety concerns and other factors, Therefore, there is a demand for alternative methods in the market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Build your own combination boxing&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Greedy decided to finally fight for Shengfa She tried her best once, and if she failed again, she decided to let herself go. &quot;I can&#39;t continue to struggle in the whirlpool of hair loss. Even if I have no hair and wear a wig all my life, I still want to be a happy little girl.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gantan listed the experience he gained from seeking medical treatment for seven years, and created a set of &quot;hair growth combination boxing&quot; methods that cover washing and care steps, medication combination, dietary structure, and work and rest adjustments. Looking back, Greedy thinks that was the moment when &quot;the gears of his destiny began to turn.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I completely relaxed my mood, adjusted my lifestyle, and followed my DIY method for two months, my scalp began to be covered with new hair, and my hair grew back again.&quot; Speaking of this &quot;Miracle&quot;, Greedy still finds it incredible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this set of combos, Greedy insists on completing at least two of the three things &quot;eat well, sleep well, feel good&quot; every day. She made a video of her experience and shared it on the Internet, which received tens of thousands of likes. Greanman discovered that she was not the only one suffering from hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, once alopecia is diagnosed, it is likely that you will need to fight it for life. Waiting for the emergence of new technologies and reconciling with oneself have become life issues for &quot;bald young people&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Hongbo, a 22-year-old senior in college, was diagnosed with androgenic alopecia. After using minoxidil for nearly a year with no obvious results, he chose to go to a hair transplant institution for forehead transplantation. To his surprise, the forehead after hair transplantation was still visibly sparse, accompanied by a large amount of shedding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tu Ming, dean of Yonghe’s hair transplant business, told Southern Weekend reporters that the principle of hair transplantation is to transplant healthy hair follicles from the occipital area of ​​the body to areas with sparse hair. It is mainly used in androgenic alopecia. With current technical means, androgenic alopecia cannot be cured. Therefore, hair transplantation can improve the current aesthetic problem, but it does not mean that hair loss can be stopped after hair transplantation. Controlling hair loss to a more satisfactory level requires long-term medication and maintenance. treat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the slightly M-angled hairline of his newborn son, Aric worried that his M-shaped hair loss would be passed on to the next generation. Fu Hongbo&#39;s way of explaining his explanation is &quot;I believe in the development of science and technology. Maybe hair follicle cloning technology will appear in a few years to completely solve this problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The medical community never stops working hard. In June 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pfizer&#39;s new drug Ritlecitinib for the treatment of alopecia areata in adolescents and adults aged 12 years and older. Ritexitinib becomes the first drug approved to treat adolescents with alopecia areata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Compared with baricitinib, the first treatment for severe alopecia areata in adults approved in China, ritexitinib has a stronger targeting effect on the autoimmune inflammatory pathways related to alopecia areata. It is safer and more effective, bringing new breakthroughs in the treatment of alopecia areata,&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Greedy is a &quot;hair growth blogger&quot; with 100,000 followers on social media. There are always people leaving private messages, asking her to recommend a product that is most helpful for hair growth. Gretchen replies over and over again: &quot;Don&#39;t believe that any product can cure your hair loss. The only way is to start by changing your lifestyle.&quot; , build your own combination punch.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a brand manager engaged in marketing and product development, Mei Lan was diagnosed with diffuse alopecia areata in June 2022. After experiencing hair loss for half a year, Mei Lan seemed to have been reborn. &quot;No matter how busy you are at work, you still have to exercise every day. People always have to give themselves some space. When life is no longer limited to one branch, I naturally no longer care about the gains and losses on this road, because I will have many branches.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to make peace with yourself and hair loss. Her hair is like a greedy experimental field. She keeps sowing seeds on it. Sometimes the harvest is poor and sometimes it is abundant. Even if she has a set of &quot;combination punches&quot; to deal with it, sometimes a mood swing is enough to destroy all the hard work and she has to start from scratch. came. But the good news is that as long as you continue to maintain a good attitude and living habits, everything will happily get better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glutton never broke up with her boyfriend of nine years.
