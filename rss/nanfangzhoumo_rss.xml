The cave &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tawny and bare, this was my first impression of Luozha County. Luozha County is located in a mountain valley, and the county seat winds along the only mountain road in the middle. I chose to come to Luozha, Shannan City, to visit the Sakagutuo Temple with a history of more than 900 years in the Border Se Township. This is a pilgrimage road often walked by Buddhists. It has a long history and a mysterious place. As for the scenery, although I am not a Buddhist, I am also full of yearning for the beautiful scenery on the border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 9 o&#39;clock in the morning, I set off from the bus station in the northern suburbs of Lhasa and passed through the beautiful Yanghu Lake and rows of snow-capped mountains. When I arrived in Lozha County, it was about 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. I immediately bought the only daily ticket at the station. A ticket to Sexiang. It still takes nearly two hours to drive to Sexiang. The road begins to narrow and there are more gravels. But I was still attracted by the barren and spectacular scenery outside the window. One side of the car is close to the exposed rocks, and the other side is close to the rushing river. The river is rushing forward happily, as if it is racing with the car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/4CJwybPlikMf1N8rb8DErCaYsiUpV1g4HfqvdEr5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/4CJwybPlikMf1N8rb8DErCaYsiUpV1g4HfqvdEr5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Loza County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were only five or six people on the bus An old Tibetan man, a young Tibetan man and me. The young Tibetan man comes from the Garze region and has been traveling to Tibet for more than half a year. This time he went specifically to Lapu Hot Spring in Sexiang. He wore a down jacket and carried a small plastic bag with him, but no other luggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was already 7:30 when I arrived in Sexiang. I quickly found a place to stay before it got dark. The entire township is located on a flat land in the mountains. There are dozens of buildings built along the road. They are all occupied by local people. In order to welcome guests, some have been converted into hotels and some into restaurants. Hotels are either closed or full, and the owner is rarely there, leaving only a phone number. Finally, I finally found a bed at the Sakaguto Temple Hotel. There was a public bathroom, but I couldn&#39;t take a shower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Zr1UWUXJhF4ejzye7gI0fYIs2ePDIci33DQAPxht.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;702&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Zr1UWUXJhF4ejzye7gI0fYIs2ePDIci33DQAPxht.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255467&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Saika Gutuo Temple in Sexiang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;sai Kagutuo Monastery was originally a monastery of the Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhism, but later converted to the Gelug sect. It is a must-visit place for Tibetan pilgrims. The main building of Sakagutuo Temple, which has a history of more than 900 years, has been relatively completely preserved. The temple is located in the middle of Se Township, next to the cliff, and the sound of rushing river water comes from the bottom of the mountain, which is quiet and distant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a legendary and touching story of redemption behind the nine-story tower of Sakagutuo Temple. According to legend, in the 11th century, Marpa, the founder of the Kagyu sect, who was known as &quot;one of the seven great translators of ancient Tibet&quot;, had a disciple named Milarepa. He lost his father when he was young, his wealth was seized by relatives, and his family was enslaved. When he grew up, he learned magic and killed 35 people in revenge. Later, in order to atone for his sins, Milarepa came to Sexiang to become a disciple of Marpa. Marpa ordered Milarepa to build Sakagutuo Temple alone (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Means &quot;Nine-story Gongzi Castle&quot;&lt;/span>;). Day after day, year after year, every time he built it, Marpa asked him to overthrow and rebuild it, until it was finally completed the sixth time. The current Sakagutuo Temple was built at that time (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;later repaired and expanded&lt;/span>;). Ancient prayer wheels hang on the outside of the predominantly yellow temple, and murals from hundreds of years ago can still be faintly seen on the mottled walls inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pxdG2sSTqGXq9MC2LtS1A4lLkzoChetIoN1Fsd6t.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pxdG2sSTqGXq9MC2LtS1A4lLkzoChetIoN1Fsd6t.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255472&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Green space by the Sexiang River and a released calf&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;There is a small suspended plank road on the top of the 9-story watchtower tower for people to pray for blessings. When I climbed to the ninth floor, a lama said that since I had come up, I should go around the tower. It is said that turning once can wash away all the bad luck in the past life; turning twice can pray for the health and happiness of parents; turning three times will prevent you from falling into hell in the next life. However, except for the steel poles that can be grasped by hand, there are no protective fences around the top of the tower. I was afraid of heights and dared not go up. Finally, I walked around in a circle under the leadership of the lama. The young lama chanted sutras while walking. He walked many times every day and it became a daily routine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Sakagutuo Temple is very small and can be completed in less than half an hour. On the top of the mountain south of Sexiang, there is also Lodro Wolong Monastery, which is the birthplace of the Kagyu Sect of Tibetan Buddhism and was built by Master Marpa when he was 29 years old. According to the official website of Luozha County Government, &quot;Luo&quot; means &quot;south&quot;, &quot;Zhuowo&quot; means &quot;beginning of auspiciousness&quot;, and &quot;Long&quot; means &quot;prophecy&quot;. Luozhawolong Temple is where the master predicted and prophesied. place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It takes several hours to walk to the Luozhuo Wolong Temple on the top of the mountain, and there is no public transportation. I found a ride on the road and met a Tibetan family who drove up the mountain and picked me up. The family came from neighboring Cona County and came to Luozha County for pilgrimage for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/inSaPHeNkpXYh4IsTR42m20Z8b2IQG4o1WhqTgvd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/inSaPHeNkpXYh4IsTR42m20Z8b2IQG4o1WhqTgvd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255471&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sexiang is dozens of kilometers away from Bhutan. Opposite the Sekhar Guto Temple is the Bhutanese commodity store, and the back of the mountain where Lodro Wolong Temple is located is In Bhutan, our ID cards were held at the checkpoint on the way up the mountain. The dusty gravel road was winding and difficult to walk. A couple from Guangdong decided to give up after driving for a short distance, but this Tibetan family did not. After half an hour, we successfully reached the top of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are only temples on the mountain, and the landscape is extremely open. Several huge crows are circling overhead, and the shadows of clouds are cast on the mountain. Lodzo Wolong Temple is built along the stone wall on the top of the mountain. In addition to the main temple, there are also many small hermitages scattered under the cliff. A lama who has been practicing for many years has long hair reaching his waist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lamas in Lodro Wolong Monastery are the most enthusiastic lamas I have ever encountered. They explained the story behind the temple to everyone who went up the mountain. Although I was the only Han tourist, after they finished telling a long list of Tibetan words, they would tell it to me again in Chinese. According to them, the old Lodro Wolong Temple was destroyed and was rebuilt in 1992. There is a sky burial platform at the top of the mountain. A lama in his twenties said that it was built based on a stone that Marpa carried back from India where he studied scriptures for 12 years. On the hillside at the foot of the temple, there is a flat area surrounded by prayer flags. The place where stones are piled is Shunyuantian. According to legend, this is the place where Marpa and Milarepa met for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We stayed on the mountain for more than half a day, during which time the temple held a Dharma ceremony and witnessed the Tibetan Buddhist Dharma ceremony. Finally, I went down the mountain with the Tibetan family, and the car went around the zigzag road back to Sexiang. We separated and continued our journeys. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[好心多修120米路要拆除？公共资金不能这么造丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259415]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A long-awaited road has been built an extra 120 meters, becoming an illegal land occupation and will be demolished , wait until the procedures are completed before re-doing it. Why is it so fussy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from the Hunan Radio and Television Urban Channel, a new road in Changsha City that nearby residents have long awaited will be opened soon. However, a section of this road was suddenly surrounded again recently, and excavators were excavating the paved asphalt road. Street lights, street trees and other facilities on the roadside were also dismantled and removed, and garbage trucks were also brought in from other places. The loess was transported and poured on the road. What happened? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that the main part of this road is in Changsha Economic Development Zone, but it extends 120 meters to Furong District. When the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company was building the road, it built an extra 120 meters along the way without going through the construction application procedures with the relevant departments of Furong District. The Furong District Natural Resources and Planning Department determined that this was “illegal land occupation.” As a result, the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company responsible for the construction began to demolish the road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, staff from the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company said that they agreed that the land was indeed being used illegally, but they were &quot;purely out of good intentions.&quot; Also, if we don&#39;t build more of these 120 meters, there may be no way to connect it with other roads, and there will be a section of &quot;intestinal obstruction&quot; in the middle, so it won&#39;t make much sense to build this road, so we &quot;kindly&quot; help and provide money and efforts to complete it. The more than 100 meters of road should be repaired. So when they were deemed illegal by the relevant departments of Furong District, they felt a little aggrieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Furong District, the extra 120 meters of road construction is within my jurisdiction. According to regulations, road construction should follow procedures and be submitted for approval in advance. It is of course illegal to build roads without approval. The competent department requires that the illegal status be eliminated and the construction be restored to its original state. The construction application procedures will be completed before re-repairing, which is completely &quot;in accordance with the law and regulations and in compliance with the procedures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There seems to be nothing wrong with both sides. However, after construction and demolition, demolition and construction again, a lot of money was wasted. What went wrong? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jingkai District Urban Construction Company that built the road built it without approval. Of course, there were violations of laws and regulations. However, the road has been repaired, and it is indeed a road that has been long-awaited by the nearby people and is necessary to be repaired. However, if it is forced to be demolished, the problem may be even greater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all this is a huge waste of public funds. Although the 120-meter road is not long, it costs a lot. The entire road is about 1 kilometer long and costs 60 million yuan. Calculating the cost of 120 meters is 6 to 7 million yuan, and dismantling it will also cost a lot of money. Once it was built or demolished, millions would disappear. This is a municipal road, and the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company responsible for its construction is also a state-owned enterprise. The source of its construction funds must be public funds of the local government, that is, public money. For Furong District, it is a good thing that the Economic Development Zone is willing to spend the money to build its own roads. If it is forced to be demolished and then rebuilt by oneself, although the cost of demolition will be borne by the Economic Development District Urban Construction Company, the cost of reconstruction will still be borne by Furong District. It is also incomprehensible to abandon existing roads that have been built with help from others and to dig up and spend money to rebuild them yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, a section of the repaired road is dug out, and the rest becomes a dead end road. It took three years to build this road, and the nearby people had been waiting for it for three years. It was finally opened, but a section was demolished, and its effectiveness was greatly reduced. If we have to go through the formalities and rebuild it again, I am afraid we will have to wait at least another year and a half. This will bring great inconvenience to the public&#39;s travel and will also damage the image of the local government in the public mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Requiring the Economic Development Zone to demolish the roads and then rebuild them themselves can be said to be harmful to Furong District and not beneficial to itself. So why do the relevant departments in Furong District do this? From the perspective of organizational behavior, perhaps one or two explanations can be given. For some departments, they must make the decision on their own territory. It is absolutely unacceptable for others to interfere with their boundaries without telling them. Even if you spend more money, you must maintain your authority. After all, if you want to spend money, it is also a financial expense, rather than having to pay out of your own pocket. Only consider issues from the perspective of one place and one department, from the perspective of maintaining the authority of the local area and this department, only consider legal compliance from the perspective of this department, and show your sense of existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for whether the decision made is reasonable from a higher level, whether it will waste financial resources and state-owned assets, waste local taxpayers&#39; money and public interests and perceptions, and consume administrative credibility, it is not considered. scope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident shows the fragmentation and lack of coordination among relevant government departments, the lack of appreciation for the use of fiscal funds, and the lack of care for the waste of state-owned assets. Such things are not uncommon. In the past few years, roads in some cities have been dug up frequently. Today they are laying water pipes, tomorrow they are burying wires, and the day after tomorrow they have to repair sewers. Frequently digging and repairing, repairing and digging again not only wastes construction funds, but also doubles the construction period and brings great inconvenience to citizens&#39; travel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, after the media reports this time, the relevant departments of Changsha Furong District have urgently stopped the behavior of damaging the road surface, and have speeded up the relevant procedures to legalize the 120-meter road as soon as possible. This case has been solved. I hope there will be fewer such absurd things in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“软实力之父”约瑟夫·奈：“中美间的交流应该是面向所有人的”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259507]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Is there destined to be a war between China and the United States? My answer Yes, no.&quot; Joseph Nye, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School, gave a negative answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye is a representative figure of the neoliberal school of international relations. Before and after the Cold War, Joseph Nye was famous for proposing the concept of &quot;soft power&quot;. Soft power refers to a country&#39;s strength other than economic and military strength, and mainly refers to influence such as culture, values, and public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He served successively as Assistant Secretary of State in the Carter administration, Chairman of the National Intelligence Council and Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration. He is also a leading figure in American politics. But he reminded that the history of mankind is full of situations where wars &quot;accidentally&quot; entered. As long as China and the United States strengthen cooperation and act cautiously, wars can be avoided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China-US relations are one of the most important bilateral relations in the world today. On October 27, 2023, U.S. President Biden met at the White House with visiting member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since October 23, Joseph Nye has embarked on his first visit to China after the COVID-19 epidemic. Judging from the public schedule in just one week, the &quot;Father of Soft Power&quot; has successively attended speeches at many think tanks and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the afternoon of October 25, in the Qiulin Lecture Hall of the School of International Relations at Peking University, Joseph Nye spoke with the topic &quot;Are China and the United States destined to have a war?&quot; Hundreds of teachers and students discussed &quot;The History and Future of Sino-US Relations.&quot; The conference was jointly hosted by the School of International Relations at Peking University and the Institute of International Strategic Studies at Peking University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye once proposed the &quot;20-year cycle theory of Sino-US relations&quot;, that is, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the ups and downs of the relationship between the two countries have been based on a 20-year cycle. And change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the long run, China and the United States will have better relations. But in the short term, China and the United States still have differences to resolve.&quot; Joseph Nye told the South Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye believes that after 2017, Sino-US relations entered a cycle of great power competition. &quot;China-U.S. relations have gotten worse in the past. In a sense, I think we have seen the deterioration of Sino-U.S. relations, but I hope things will get better.&quot; Joseph Nye told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, discussions about the &quot;new cold war&quot; between China and the United States have been rampant in European and American public opinion circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Joseph Nye&#39;s view, the Cold War between China and the United States is completely incommensurable with the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. “During the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, although there was military and political competition between the two countries, their economic and social ties were very sparse. But now China and the United States are highly interdependent in many fields such as economy, society, and ecology. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2020, Joseph Nye wrote an article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that the Cold War between China and the United States is completely avoidable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye supports China and the United States in strengthening cooperation in public health, climate change and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Exchanges between China and the United States should be open to everyone. Exchanges at the cultural and scientific levels are equally important.&quot; Joseph Nye told Southern Weekend reporters that he hopes The public&#39;s attention should not only focus on high-level people, but also exert soft power. Low-level contacts are also very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The following is an interview with Joseph Nye:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sino-US relations have gotten worse in the past. In a sense, we have seen a deterioration in Sino-US relations, but I hope things will get better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unfortunately, during the COVID-19 epidemic, communication between China and the United States has not been sufficient. However, communication between China and the United States has begun to change. The United States sent important cabinet members to visit China, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also arrived in Washington for a visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I think Sino-US relations are making progress. Two years ago, Sino-US relations were worse than they are now. What we&#39;re seeing today is some pickup, and I hope it continues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among China and the United States, China not only has strong economic performance, but also has the attraction of traditional culture. I believe that a country’s soft power comes not only from government actions but also from civil society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The U.S. government often does some unpopular things, but despite this, America&#39;s civil society remains attractive to others because it is relatively free. Therefore, the soft power of the United States comes more from universities, non-profit organizations, and foundations, such as the Bill Gates Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is undeniable that people&#39;s views of the United States have gone up and down in recent years. In my opinion, the soft power of the United States has gone up and down. During the Vietnam War and when U.S. troops invaded Iraq, U.S. soft power was declining. The soft power of the United States returned again with the election of Obama as President of the United States in 2008, and fell together with Trump (who became President of the United States) in 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Soft power does not decline linearly or rise linearly. It is often cyclical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Now, the soft power of the United States is weakening due to internal divisions within the United States. On the other hand, if you look at the hard power of the United States, you will see that the U.S. economy is booming. The United States is a wellspring of innovation, leading in technological fields such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence. Looking at the situation in the Middle East today, (U.S.) military power is still very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Biden administration has been in power for three years and has a more balanced view (compared to the Trump administration). They still believe there are still benefits to working with China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In May this year, the G7 summit changed its focus on decoupling from China to de-risking on China. This expression means Countries outside the G7 will adopt partial decoupling from China, mostly in the security field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In other words, de-risking does not mean completely cutting off economic ties, but there are limits. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan called it &quot;building a high wall around a small yard.&quot; We should not let this small yard grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To prevent deterioration, Sino-US relations should start with high-level contacts. Next, look for areas of cooperation between China and the United States, which can convey to the public of both countries that cooperation with another country is beneficial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I think this is an area where China and the United States can strengthen cooperation (position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China and the United States can also strengthen cooperation in other areas, such as climate change and working with the WHO to respond to epidemics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Exchanges between China and the United States should be open to everyone. Obviously, people always focus on the president or the cabinet. Exchange on cultural and scientific levels is equally important. If we need to build trust and cooperation (with each other) and exert soft power, low-level engagement is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(Sino-US relations) have become increasingly complex and difficult to resolve in the short term. I tend to use &quot;short-term pessimists&quot; and &quot;long-term optimists&quot; to describe China and the United States as not posing a threat to each other. In the long run, China and the United States will have better relations. But in the short term, China and the United States still have differences to resolve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一斤力气9分钱，重庆最后的女棒棒]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259500]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;July 2021, Chongqing Mountain City Trail, sculptures representing Chongqing sticks and traditional stilted buildings .

You&#39;re still alive.&quot; This is the advice that 51-year-old Huang Xiuli often encounters when carrying goods at Chongqing&#39;s Chaotianmen Comprehensive Wholesale Market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Standing on the heights of Chaotianmen, you can see the intersection of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River. This is the largest water pier in Chongqing. South of the Jialing River and on the north bank of the Yangtze River is the Yangtze River Binjiang Road. On this modern street, there is the Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market, the largest wholesale market gathering place in Chongqing. It is like a streamer, flowing with people buying goods from all over the country. Chongqing’s economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The mountainous city of Chongqing has steep roads and few flat areas, and its unique topography provides Bangbang with a living space. &quot;Bangbang&quot; is a Chongqing dialect that originally means &quot;stick&quot;. It is a local name for farmers who carry a bamboo stick and engage in heavy physical labor. In the Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market, Bangbangs are responsible for the last link in this economic chain: transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If you look carefully, you can find a few female figures among the sticks passing through the shops in the market. With their hair cut short or in buns, they look sophisticated and sophisticated, just like the men who dominate the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some of them work alone, and some open &quot;couple teams&quot;. In industries where they sell their physical strength to make a living, they often have to deal with employers questioning their &quot;business capabilities.&quot; But even so, they don&#39;t want to give up the stick. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Moving things uphill is the most annoying thing”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At Chaotianmen at 6 o&#39;clock in the morning, the freighter on the riverside sounded its whistle, and the truck and asphalt The sound of the road rubbing against each other was more lively than the Chongqing night market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 30, 2023, Huang Xiuli opened the window, and the noise and sunlight penetrated into the room. On the floor were corrugated boxes of pickles and corrugated boxes that Huang Xiuli had collected from various places. Drink bottles and leftovers were scattered on the table... Huang Xiuli picked out this house filled with musty smell one pound at a time. of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Xiuli has been a &quot;professional player&quot; for 24 years. A stick, a three-meter-long red nylon rope, and a 232 yuan trolley are all her assistants in her work. Every morning at 6:45, Huang Xiuli goes to work in Dazheng Shopping Mall on time. While waiting for orders to come to her door, she and other Bang Bangs set up a gantry formation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In September 2023, Huang Xiuli was transporting goods.

(Zheng Cailin/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The employer that Huang Xiuli works with the most is Liu Chunsheng, nicknamed &quot;Liu Youtou&quot;. He has been selling men&#39;s clothing in Dazheng Shopping Mall for 25 years , with a bulging beer belly and a conspicuous bald head. Every morning when Liu Youtou was sorting out the cargo list, Huang Xiuli came over to help him load and carry the goods bag by bag according to the delivery location. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Youtou agreed to pay 30 yuan per bag, which was the better price Huang Xiuli could get at Chaotianmen Market. One bag weighs 309.6 kilograms, and the straight-line distance is 324 meters - in 2023, Huang Xiuli&#39;s effort is worth an average of 9 cents per kilogram. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It&#39;s affordable, usually more than ten yuan.&quot; Most of the goods she carries are clothing, which are light in weight and correspondingly priced lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Huang Xiuli’s experience, you need to use your brain to carry goods and not be reckless. In order to reduce air resistance, she lowered her head when pulling goods; she wore gloves on her hands to increase friction with the cart. &quot;The most annoying thing is carrying things uphill. Carrying it alone makes my head hurt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In her early years at Chaotianmen, on the way home, Huang Xiuli’s inventory list Her bag was robbed by a motorcycle. &quot;How can I bear it? It&#39;s my hard-earned money.&quot; In order to keep the money, Huang Xiuli competed with the motorcycle, causing the bones of her upper arm to shift. &quot;I spent thousands, but the doctor didn&#39;t give me any money.&quot; Cure”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, for unknown reasons, the soles of Huang Xiuli’s feet swelled up. When she woke up, she started to feel pain when she stepped on the ground early in the morning. She thought about inserting acupuncture and applying medicinal wine on her own, but the more treatment she got, the more &quot;irritated&quot; she became. Therefore, Huang Xiuli likes to roll up half of her trouser legs to &quot;air out&quot; her calves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Due to physical pain, Huang Xiuli would move sideways slowly when lifting large heavy objects uphill or downhill. For a large box over one meter high, Huang Xiuli will first unfold the rope and move it under the heavy object, lift the two ends, cross-tie them and put them on bamboo sticks, and support the goods with both hands while walking. For Huang Xiuli, the body is not only a tool, but also her partner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At 4 p.m., every merchant in the Chaotianmen Wholesale Market pulled down their rolling shutters. Huang Xiuli hid her sticks and trucks in the mall and went home to cook. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;When going uphill and downhill, Huang Xiuli cannot use a cart and needs to carry the goods manually.

She is the youngest in her family and has four sisters. When she was in the countryside, Huang Xiuli often dragged her sister&#39;s large clothes to the fields to break buds, harvest wheat, and thresh millet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if she works from dawn to dusk in the village, Huang Xiuli earns only enough money to feed herself. She decided to visit the city. The night before leaving Dianjiang, she went to the bamboo forest in the mountains and cut two bamboos, thinking that she would make money from this stick in the future. That night, Huang Xiuli slept with Bangbang in her arms. The next day, she closed the doors and windows and went straight to the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Xiuli came to Chaotianmen in 1997. She was 26 years old that year. She had no crow&#39;s feet in her eyes, slightly curly black hair, tied with a black rubber band, and was energetic. Capable. The reason why I came to Chaotianmen is because this is the Feng Shui treasure land for Bangbang people to make a fortune. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1991, Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market officially opened. By 1997, the market business area had grown from the initial 6,000 square meters to 270,000 square meters, and the number of operating households had grown from more than 500 to more than 10,000. In 1996, the annual transaction volume of the market here reached 3 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, on Chaodong Road where Bangbang lived, Peng Li, who was in charge of Chongqing Bishan Logistics, opened a freight order of more than 20,000 yuan a day. &quot;My joints hurt so much when I started to write,&quot; Peng Li said in pain and happiness. Liu You&#39;s first day&#39;s trade volume can reach more than 30,000 yuan. He describes his orders as being like a train pulling coal with no end in sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi also caught up with this wave of &quot;dividends&quot;. In the late 1990s, Gao Zongqi and Lao Zhao, who were from Qijiang, grew corn in their hometown. In the first year, they took their products to the city to sell them, but half of them were robbed before they even entered the city. They lost money. The next year, I took it to the city to sell it and made another loss. I heard that you can make money by helping people carry things in the city, so the couple picked up the stick and went to Chaotianmen. &quot;I can&#39;t read, so it&#39;s safer to be with my husband.&quot; This has been followed in Chaotianmen for 19 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of each year, the couple will receive a package fee of 10,000 yuan from their boss. Zhao laughed and said that he also gets a &quot;year-end bonus&quot; like white-collar workers. They relied on this &quot;year-end bonus&quot; to cover the expenses of returning home for the New Year. Gao Zongqi&#39;s parents praised their son-in-law for his promise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Dongqiu came to Chaotianmen for his son&#39;s wife Ben. Thirty years ago, Zhao Dongqiu and her husband opened a retail store in Anyue County, Sichuan. Although they made more money than farming, the couple was still worried about when they would be able to buy a house for their son and marry him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After chatting with someone, I learned that being a stick can make money quickly. The couple cut two sections of bamboo in their own mountain, scraped off the bamboo skin with a sickle, and wrapped the bamboo around them. We put on tape and nylon rope, bought tickets overnight, and arrived at Chaotianmen in the early morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When he first came to Chaotianmen, Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s income was only two yuan a day. But she was not in a hurry and wandered around with the rope (rope) on her back. For four months, Zhao Dongqiu wandered around Chaotianmen and found out about her own &quot;human society&quot;: which family had girls who were many years old, and which family&#39;s mother-in-law had a hard life. It’s up to you, otherwise I can only work on a blank slate (not earning a penny).” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Slowly, 5 yuan, 10 yuan... more and more consignment notes entered Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s pocket. In 2003, the &quot;starting price&quot; of Bangbang was 15 yuan, and Zhao Dongqiu and her husband could get orders of more than 10,000 yuan in a month at most. When carrying goods, Zhao Dongqiu often wears jeans, a yellow shirt worth more than 30 yuan, and a thin gold necklace around his neck. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The cakes in Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trade Market are getting bigger and bigger, and there are more and more sticks. Chongqing University&#39;s 2010 &quot;Survey on the Living Conditions of Shancheng Bangbang Army&quot; showed that during the most prosperous period, there were approximately 400,000 Bangbangs in Chongqing, of which 3% were women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Chongqing Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market is the first stop for most people looking for work.

(Zheng Cailin/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Poet Fu Wei once described it this way: In Chongqing, when your friends are drunk, you can ask a stick to carry them back; for your girlfriend’s birthday, You can ask a group of Bangbangs to send flowers and sing a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; song; if your pet encounters misfortune, you can ask Bangbangs to help cry...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Although they can make money, Bangbang people live frugally. Ms. Liu and her husband have run the only clinic on Chaodong Road for more than 30 years. In Liu’s impression, it was rare for Bangbang to come to see a doctor. Even if he did come, he would always prescribe some medicine for headaches and fever. “They were reluctant to pay for it. I prescribed a pack of Acafol powder for 10 cents, and he asked me if it could be cheaper. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The boss likes to find male bangbangs”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Female bangbangs are not popular in Chaotianmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi said that Huang Xiuli has a graceful appearance and does not look like a physical worker. There is no market for such a girl in Chaotianmen Bangbang. Once a boss thought she was a girl and couldn&#39;t afford the work, so Huang Xiuli would talk back: &quot;I can&#39;t afford it without paying!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I can afford it.&quot; So what if you get up? You will be Bangbang for the rest of your life, and I will be the boss for the rest of your life.&quot; The sharp-tongued Huang Xiuli shut up when she heard this. Bangbang, who sells his strength, is inseparable from the boss&#39;s choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The boss likes to find men to bang.&quot; In this industry, physical strength means money.在朝天门批发市场，大宗货物的商场更青睐有体力的男棒棒。 “他们一车可以赚五十多，我一单三十，滴滴嘎嘎（很少）的。”勤能补拙，黄秀丽只得多拉几趟。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高宗琦很羡慕能担玩具的男棒棒，“钱多，一趟顶我（担）鞋子的三趟。”她1998年来到朝天门，在黄秀丽对面的新重庆朝天门国际鞋都担货。高宗琦也曾和老板商量，但老板下一次还是叫男棒棒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高宗琦也没气馁，老老实实打包自己的鞋子，“他们男的瓜西西的（傻的），可干不了这细活儿。”每次得知需要打包的数目，高宗琦就开始构思如何横平竖直地将鞋盒最大限度放进箱子里。塞紧了，影响卖相；塞宽了，箱子顶部封不上胶，可能还要浪费另外一个箱子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高宗琦打包的步骤像化妆：先横铺打底一层，第二层换个角度大面积晕染，最后再像填补痘痘坑一样，见缝插针塞几个规格小的鞋盒，最后封胶，系绳。高宗琦手起“刀”落，打包绳就一刀两断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“手比刀好用，但速度要快，不然要见血。”已经有25年“棒龄”的高宗琦总能快速找到绳子的分叉点，迅速将其拽断。长年重复动作，高宗琦食指的关节处多了一条沟壑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;打包最后一个步骤完成，高宗琦还要负责“售后”，将店主剩下的鞋子摆放好，收拾好垃圾，再将货物拉到对面的驿站。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;高宗琦和丈夫一起打包鞋子。（郑彩琳/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/004772f5a4.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;那个男棒棒不屈不挠，一天晚上9点，以搬运货物为借口，约黄秀丽出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“老子信你个球，谁大半夜要运货？以后再拿老子耍，老子先把你耍了。”黄秀丽平时声音不大，但尖锐刺耳，稍微提高一个度，可以唬住一桌男棒棒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;最怕担不到货&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;困难再多，黄秀丽也没想过不做棒棒，但挡不住行业式微。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;她记得很清楚，2008年汶川地震之后，朝天门的生意就撇掉了，“好多人都是川渝人，回家了。大家也没心思赚钱了，命要紧”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“余震”延宕到2010年，朝天门批发市场面临提档升级、综合整治，好多商户都动了搬出朝天门的念头。 “外头的生意撇了，来进货的少了。”刘油头回忆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;物流公司兴起，快递上门的服务行业竞争愈演愈烈，加上重庆轨道交通四通八达，私家车兴盛，似乎一切都在争抢棒棒的“饭碗”。肩扛竹棒、沿街游荡揽活的棒棒越来越少。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2021年，西北民族大学新闻传播学院发布的重庆棒棒生存现状调查估算，重庆的棒棒数量已不到2000人，且以老年人居多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;高宗琦和丈夫合力搬运货物，途中遇到一个坡坎，路人一起帮忙。（郑彩琳/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/330feb0e5c.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽也不想回家。 “女棒棒一个，看见熟人，不好说得话。”亲戚认为黄秀丽在城里当棒棒会受侮辱。 “我没觉得啥子丢脸，但他们总觉得你有啥事情似的。他们咋晓得我搞了好多钱？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽想，能挣到钱就好，其余不算什么。 “苦不打紧，最怕是担不到货，一天开天就要见好几百块钱。每次钱还没在口袋里捂热，就不见了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽算了一笔账：一个月4000元房贷需要按时应付上；儿子正在读书，一个月800元生活费也不能少；女儿生了外孙，夫妻两人都没有工作，黄秀丽和老高每个月2000元供着。为了在商场中占据一席之地，黄秀丽还需每年给商场上交2000元“占地费”——占据15块瓷砖构成的7平方米地块，黄秀丽的儿子闲暇时就坐在那里边等妈妈边耍手机。加上水电物业和伙食费，黄秀丽觉得每个月需要8000元左右，家才能开张。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;每年的9、10、11月份是朝天门服装市场的换货季，往年也是棒棒们赚钱的黄金期。但今年，两三天之后就没有货担。按老赵的话说，现在打水的钱都打不赢。刘油头也下定决心回老家了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;彭莉还是坐在路边的小板凳上，不过现在一天只能开两千多元的货运单。黄秀丽经常等下班的时候偷偷去捡瓦纸楞子。高宗琦还是每天6点坐在朝天门国际鞋都等货，早餐从两根苞谷变成了一根苞谷，“没得钱挣，不要白吃”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;棒棒少了，女棒棒更少了。南方周末走访发现，如今，在朝天门的女棒棒有8位，其中4位在新重庆朝天门国际鞋都担鞋子，1位在商储商场第三交易区搬衣服，还有3位流动在朝东路，主要搬运外来货物。在三峡广场的女棒棒有4位，其中2位经常在重庆新世纪超市门口等货，还有2位跟着丈夫到处拉货。在菜园坝公交站的女棒棒有1位，她旺季下午“收摊”，淡季担一早上就回去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;被问及之前更多的女棒棒去哪里了，目前这块地区还有多少女棒棒，她们的答案都是“不知道”“不太清楚”。在其他棒棒聚集地如观音桥、白崖口街区、十八梯等，南方周末未发现女棒棒的身影。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;赵东秋早已攒够了儿子的媳妇本，但她依然不想离开朝天门。曾有人看上赵东秋的机灵劲儿，请她去算账，但赵冬秋谢绝了，“还是这里好耍些，可以和大家一起吹垮垮（聊天）”。赵冬秋现在给自己定的目标，是每天赚够100元就“下班”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽还是坚持每日外出找活儿。早上出门前，她都会在脚上抹上自制的药酒，相信自己的土方子比看医生管用。 “生活难搞，但还是希望日子变好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（除赵东秋外，文中均为化名）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;作为今年戛纳“一种关注”单元的入围影片，《河边的错误》在戛纳场刊中拿下3.5分的高分&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。在&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;刚刚结束的平遥国际电影展，本片作为开幕片又再次&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;获得诸多影评人的高评价。 &lt;span>;自2018年短片《延边少年》在戛纳亮相，短短5年间，魏书钧导演的每一部长片都获得了戛纳的垂青，获得如此优异的成绩，在90后这一代导演中，难出其右。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;魏书钧的前两部作品《野马分鬃》与《永安镇故事集》有着非常明显的个人化色彩，不仅在剧情上是一种个人经历式的讲述，还包括对于元电影叙事的偏爱。戛纳的青睐毫无疑问是对魏书钧创作才华潜能的认可，但是这两部前作仍显青涩，难掩稚嫩。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/076b56ce199a61d4ff049d4328a9f286.png&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;而《河边的错误》展现了一种自成一体的气质，标志着魏书钧在创作上的成熟。当然，这一方面得益于余华所提供的更具人文价值和阐释空间的原作小说，另一方面也是创作团队在工业化与商业性的把控下，更专业娴熟的行业表现。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/bdd362b284cc8f585bda60da8f8bef25.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;255185&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;《河边的错误》是一篇具有先锋试验性的中篇小说，发表于1988年，是余华早期的作品。余华在采访中提到，陆小雅、张艺谋都曾想改编这部作品，但都未实现，足以证明这篇小说改编电影的难度。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;王斌在记述《活着》的创作过程时，提及了自己最初向张艺谋推荐的是余华的《河边的错误》，彼时《活着》还未完全发表。张艺谋看完后顾虑《河边的错误》里人物过于符号化。在不断探讨的过程中，张艺谋还建构了一个几乎全新的故事，人物与情节都更实，而且显然更具有张艺谋的风格——这个故事以女性作为主角。只是这个创意没有了下文，张艺谋后来完全被《活着》所吸引，因此成就了中国影史的一部经典之作。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时隔三十余年，在年轻一代创作者手中，《河边的错误》焕发了新彩，魏书钧与编剧康春雷的改编没有时代的顾虑、历史的包袱，在原作基础上进行了大胆的增删、拆解与重构，既把握了原作中的荒诞本色，又对其注入了一种更贴近当下精神状态的表述。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5fe8b80026b408a31f2ac5ae24f08669.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;255190&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;余华原作中对于真相的追寻，是创作者身处上世纪八十年代末文化复兴浪潮中，对疯癫与文明的辨析，主人公马哲最终被诊断为“疯子”，是颇具讽刺意味的社会化命名。而电影版中，马哲逐渐成为疯子的过程中，遭遇的是个体被权威的碾压，记忆的不可确定性，破案过程中黑色幽默式的偶然巧合。电影临近尾声时，一个镜头内视点的变化，表明了马哲终于成为了疯子，甚至比小说中的马哲更具主动性。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;我记忆里的那个年代，疯子是常有的，有的爱在深夜的院子里高歌，有的喜欢在马路上撩逗他人等等。而在当下这个时代，我们在公共场合几乎再也看不见疯子了，但更多的人却以“精神病患者”自娱自乐自居。两个时代对于“疯子”病征的不同理解，或许正对应了两代创作者在小说和电影文本的处理中，表现出来的有所区别的精神内核。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9d3a92c4251420384063fe14d67f7c51.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;255189&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;余华说“只有笨蛋才忠于原著”，电影《河边的错误》是一次聪明又成功的改编。魏书钧在视觉上所创造的现实质感更加凸显了荒诞的虚妄性，以及令人细思极恐的诡异氛围。 16毫米的胶片拍摄为影片赋予了一种复古式的基调，呈现&lt;span>;出那个年代的小镇空间感，间或的镜头失焦感，甚至为不可确定性的主题提供了一种风格表述。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;影片中对于那个年代单位里的人和事，以及诸如诗歌会这类场景的表现，绝非复刻般的写实。导演以一种稍显夸张的讽刺，反而更微妙地传达出令人会心一笑的时代真实。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;朱一龙所饰演的马哲也为这种复古的现实质感提供了精彩的银幕形象。为更精准地诠释这个角色，朱一龙提前到取景地南丰体验生活，从余华一张旧照中找到扮相的灵感，并为这个角色先增肥后瘦身，他的体验式表演塑造了一个令人信服的马哲形象。到目前为止，这个角色是仍被标签为流量明星的朱一龙最大的银幕突破，并将奠定他作为&lt;/span>;大银幕型演员的未来。换句话说，从他身上我们看到了一件事：演技比流量更重要。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/4d2519bd4e8e9a251834b9bc08856dba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;与原作一样，《河边的错误》有一个侦探题材的类型外壳，但情节的走向和作者风格化的处理，都打破了类型悬念的期待。而且它还舍弃了原作的先锋性，叙事上以线性的顺叙作为主线，却也绝非符合大众的想象。因此，我们需要以审慎的态度看待这部电影的市场表现。但无论票房好坏，这都是一部有着独特气质的作品。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 16:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙一钿：即将到来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259484]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/lAsQWMSOeodnf7QCdK12dexC0WyrUcK0OvPbqZTe.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（Andrea Rossetti/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;活跃在当代艺术圈的“90后”中，孙一钿无疑是抓得一手好牌的那个幸运儿，她既是画廊和学术机构青睐的那类国际化创作者，也是时尚品牌和收藏市场的宠儿，作品涉及绘画、装置、行为、时尚跨界……二十多岁、刚刚离开央美校园不久，她就被亚洲福布斯评为“30岁以下杰出青年”，又在过去的两年里前后获得罗博之选The Best of Best 2022“年度青年艺术家”和《华尔街日报》中文版2022-2023“年度出色创作者”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年对于孙一钿是高强度的一年，她重归校园，在清华大学攻读文艺学博士，国内群展不断，国外展程连连，4月在柏林的个展《肖像》开幕，紧接着就是10月17日在巴黎的个展“Once Upon a Time”（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《很久很久以前》&lt;/span>;）。她那些标志性的塑胶玩偶，来自西洋流行文化，也暗藏着东方的密码，在巴黎地标芳丹广场的老建筑里，形成了独特的口音：外国观者会从图示的熟悉感里嗅到一丝微妙的异国情调。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;博导汪民安曾建议她用双线程的方式完成博士学业：白天画画，晚上读书。但其实操作起来很难，“画画还是非常烧脑，画了一天的画，晚上真的很难再啃得进学术著作”，于是她把时间分割成不同的区间：展览前闭关密集画画，待画统统运走后就开启学术模式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/IPytwWYqQQjX4FS4Yis8WejWuPCzF83Bh8eRStto.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2018年，《一钿a twinkle》，上海，BANK画廊&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;北京的五任工作室&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在9月巫鸿策展的余德耀美术馆《跨界——可能与回响》展览上，孙一钿与自己曾经的作品《有蓝色翅膀的粉色恐龙》再次相遇，那是她2017年左右的作品，整个“人造物”系列开始不久后的代表作，“办完展览之后就再没有见过它”，时隔五年，在展厅劈面相逢的时候，“跟见到一个失散多年的朋友或者孩子的心情是一模一样的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你会回忆起你当时画它的场景，甚至回忆起你画下的每一笔，那个时刻是下午3点，你画那一笔的时候，阳光正好照在落笔的地方，对，突然间，从你的潜意识里面被捞起来的那段记忆……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;记忆一瞬间全涌回来了，一幅画为她打开了通往过去的一个虫洞，不仅仅关于那幅画，还有包裹着那幅画的一整套生活：那时候她还在读研，跟当时的朋友在费家村共用一个工作室，那里有一方人造池塘，到了夏天，池塘里挤满了荷叶荷花，周围聚居的都是搞艺术的，隔壁邻居是个舞蹈家，还有摄影师，整天彼此串门，去池塘钓鱼，吃大锅饭：炖甲鱼，麻辣小龙虾……度过许多个热热闹闹的夜晚，仿佛乌托邦。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那是集体生活的挽歌，跟学生时代几乎同步消亡，“现在我没有集体生活了，只剩下工作。”在工作室贴着小稿的墙上，能看到工作狂的痕迹：展览事务日程表被精确到每一天，列成清单贴在显眼处；而不显眼的地方，密密麻麻用铅笔写了一整排的“45”，其中不少“45”已经划掉——这是好学生孙一钿逼自己专注画画的方式，她相信每个45分钟是一个注意力集中的周期，学校的课时就是这么设置的，每认真画完一个45分钟，她就把它划掉，然后允许自己有一次小小的课间休息：她一度喜欢使用高饱和的荧光色，长时间作业和凝视之后，眼睛会超载。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BaVQHStk7Nt3jSUleSOHrwNw0XOXUbTuUiNWbfRY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BaVQHStk7Nt3jSUleSOHrwNw0XOXUbTuUiNWbfRY.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;这已经是孙一钿在北京的第五个工作室，也是她认为“最豪华”的一个。所谓豪华，是指拥有暖气和冷气，而且有挑高的屋顶，天顶开窗，引来稳定的自然光，大开间的门，方便运输大尺幅作品，二楼三楼是储藏室和卧房，有足够大的架子放她过往的作品，有一张床让她熬夜画画的时候可以卧倒——一个架上艺术家所奢求的，无非就是这些。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前的其他工作室，只能用简陋和颠沛流离来形容。她会掰着手指细数：第一个工作室在方舟苑，央美旁边的住宅楼里，空间和光线都局促，没法施展开画大画，画面的尺幅稍微大一点，颜色关系和深入程度就都不对。第二个在费家村，那是一段快乐时光，却遭遇强拆，一批艺术家像被驱逐般撵走了。第三个工作室在火鸡厂附近，有一年夏天突然漫大水，把她大部分画都泡了，于是逃也似的离开那里，搬到陆界。第四个工作室，冬天没暖气，夏天没空调。她在这个冰窟里熬了三个冬天，脚踩一方小小的电热地毯作画，手一会儿就冻得冰凉僵硬，只能塞在屁股下面暖一暖，然后继续画。母亲从温州来看她，感受到南方从未有过的极寒天气，到了夜晚，工作室四周漆黑一团连路灯都没有，忍不住叫了起来：女儿！你在这儿是遭的什么罪啊？ ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/XgzliM17Uhji4QMm2nlJC71KUgC9DGMrnP5WQ8VH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;738&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/XgzliM17Uhji4QMm2nlJC71KUgC9DGMrnP5WQ8VH.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;在中国其他省份，这种针对小学生的美术专业学校极为罕见，背后对应着的是东南沿海民间美术教育的旺盛需求。这些小学生被一种近乎全能的美术理念培养着，他们要学国画，也要学西画，素描、色彩、速写都是必备的基本功，他们要下乡写生，同时每周都要交书法作业。 “我们小学其实培养出来很多人，像这次亚运会火炬，就是我们师兄设计的，包括浙江现在活跃着的建筑师艺术家，你一问，很多都是这个小学出来的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在艺术圈，用“优等生”表扬一个人是很奇怪的事情，但孙一钿确实一路都是优等生。她的小学并不因为是美术专科而放松对文化课的要求，很多学生后续也会去上普通中学和综合性大学，不见得都一门心思想成为艺术生。孙一钿中考考入当地最好的高中温州中学，但同时，她在艺考中也拿到了国美附中和央美附中的录取通知。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tlKnhoKUFJ4monMgkf7h5D6BTlFtFh8FzkurTiM0.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《简易棚》纸本水彩，25.3cmx19.1cm，2009&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她选了央美附中，因为可以去北京，可以名正言顺地“离爸妈远一些”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对孙一钿来说，央美附中是自由而神奇的地方，她仿佛突然被打开了，一个全新的世界，以及与之相匹配的全新的感官。她至今惊奇自己在附中的时候竟然看了那么多小众电影、那么多与她年龄不相称的深奥书籍，“很多我现在压根看不下去的大闷片，那时候居然囫囵吞枣看进去了，很多哲学书其实一知半解，为装酷就硬读，周围的人也都不听流行音乐，都在听非常文艺和小众的东西，显示自己与众不同。”在附中，不主流是一种主流，这些硬吃下去的营养，不知不觉成为她底色中的一部分，“对我艺术上最大的启发，就是什么都愿意尝试，什么都感兴趣，人在那个年龄突然被打开之后，就意识到，原来一幅画可以这么画，也可以那么画。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她至今保留着附中时候的速写集，那时每周都要交大量速写，老师会在交过来的作业上盖戳表示已阅，防止学生拿以前的作品来交差。为了赶出海量的作业，她们会去北京站通宵熬大夜，画在车站过夜的乘客。天南海北的异乡人，外貌和打扮形形色色，疲倦入睡之后动也不动，是唾手可得的现成模特。暑假回到家，趁母亲洗澡，她在一旁画人体写生，母亲坦然由她去画，并不扭捏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从央美附中毕业后，她被保送央美，高考成绩文化课在艺术生中高得出奇。从央美毕业后，又直接保送央美研究生。孙一钿说，她是那种自驱力旺盛的人，学业生涯，不过是“顺水推舟”。也正是出于学霸的自觉，在当了几年艺术家之后，她又去清华读博士。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BGK6BCcuRR8Ks5wz3wSVfM4ulvO5VlLwx2jScva5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;801&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BGK6BCcuRR8Ks5wz3wSVfM4ulvO5VlLwx2jScva5.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“人造物”是水面之上炫目的浮子，“自然物”仿佛水下之锚钩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“很多人到了我工作室都喜欢这个&#39;自然物&#39;系列，上次有个姐姐过来，说这一组小画把她看哭了。”她在这个系列里融入大量的媒材实验，喜欢用一些儿童手工材料，比如一种叫“珍珠泥”的宝宝泡沫珠，可以用来塑形，也是玩具厂里的常见原料。后来发现一种日本的纸浆粘土，造型力和耐久度上佳，可以在画面上营造出类似浅浮雕般的空间效果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/RSyN0FWPkp9junVXBGZKFsIqxs7A2MxJSf78DO2v.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;639&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/RSyN0FWPkp9junVXBGZKFsIqxs7A2MxJSf78DO2v.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;几乎家家都有厂，鞋厂、眼镜厂、塑料制品厂、打火机厂……偶尔也有玩具厂，玩具厂不多，但对一个孩子的视觉冲击力却是巨大的。这些小商品的厂子都保留着简朴的生产格局，厂房往往连带着几居室，家也是它，厂也是它。改革开放之后，物质，以及由物质带来的生产，在温州像雨后春笋一样到处冒头。有意思的是，她的国际藏家对她画的这些东西也心有戚戚焉，他们告诉孙一钿：你画的那种人造物突然爆炸式丰富的时代，也许是中国的90年代吧，但在欧洲和美国，就是我们的60年代。也正因此，他们在孙一钿的画中感受到同样的兼带着怀旧和反思的复杂况味。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种共通性，在孙一钿的画面中并不罕见，仿佛暗藏的文化密码。她画巨大的偶像，容貌和五官都是西洋流行文化里常见的，但是那一方弯眉，和单眼皮的处理方式，却来自工笔国画，嘴唇似笑非笑的角度，是她依照佛教雕塑的经典形象画的。这种形象出现在展墙上，以一种俯视的姿态面对观者，无论观看者是东方人还是西方人，都会微微一愣，在似曾相识中意识到似乎哪里不对。她画的《瓷母》，一方小小的白瓷塑像，双手合十，以静默之姿站立在丛生的树根之间，这是西方家庭里常见的瓷器圣母摆件，但奇怪的是，同时也很像中国家庭供奉的德化白瓷观音。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙一钿说，在她的家乡，信仰体系庞杂，小时候她家中礼佛，常年供着观音，但到了姨夫家，他信天主教，家中供着圣母像。作为小孩子，她常常感到迷糊，在她眼中，那慈祥慈悲的女性面容并无本质的分别。手工艺品的本土化，加深了这种审美上的互相借鉴。姨夫家常常有神父出入，除了神情比较超然和淡漠之外，她看不出神父跟普通乡邻有何分别。当地的教堂亦如是，形式是欧化的，但带有浓浓的中式装修风。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她热衷于在不同文化中翻检这些共通的蛛丝马迹，出于一种对图像的好奇。她画美杜莎，在画册里翻看卡拉瓦乔等一众经典名画，美杜莎头顶的蛇全是活蛇，画家要着力画出那种扭动纠缠的暴力感，栩栩如生，那是文化经典输出给她的符号。而在她的私人记忆里，美杜莎只是小时候看见妈妈范思哲包包上的logo，当时令她讶异，干嘛用一个凶怪女人的脑袋作标签？为了画出她自己的美杜莎，她在网上买来一堆橡胶塑料的盘曲之蛇作为参考，它们的凶残、斑斓只是虚张声势——“我就是要把它们都画成假蛇，逼真的假。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“即将到来”的也许是新的生命，也许是她即将步入其中的成年生活。但对孙一钿来说，“即将到来”更像是发生在自然界中的某个时刻，“在我的家乡，南方有很多雷雨，那种突然降下的大暴雨，天黑压压一片，白天好像晚上，雨点巨大，倾盆大雨，然后电闪雷鸣。我小时候有很多这样的记忆，我站在我家的窗户下，看着外面的大暴雨，天突然间亮起来，然后才会从远处传来一阵雷声。我的&#39;即将到来&#39;，就是闪电已经闪了、雷还没有来的那个时刻。我又紧张又害怕，又期待那个时刻到来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她不解释她的画面，任由观者得出他们的解读，无论是性别议题、流行文化议题、物质议题、消费主义议题……她都安之若素，正如她那幅《瓷母》，信观音者见到的是观音、信圣母者见到的是圣母一样，她相信任何观看，首先折射的是观看者的文化记忆和信息储备，而不是创作者的意图。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;博士论文即将开题，汪民安建议她说，你写写消费主义吧，言下之意是跟她画的议题有关联，写起来更容易有心得，她也觉得合理，只是担心自己逻辑能力不强——写论文的学术构建跟她驾轻就熟的画面构图，完全是两码事。汪老师有时也会从“消费”的角度问她：听说你一幅画已经卖到百万级别了？她吓得只摇手：老师老师，咱千万别聊这个。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“我只有第一次展览卖画的所得对我是有意义的，因为那意味着我可以自己养活自己，成为一名独立艺术家。在那之前，我一直都在跟父母打预防针，要他们做好我可能毕业后没工作、不得不回家啃老的心理准备，那笔钱给了我极大的自由。来自金钱的快乐就到此为止了。那之后卖出的任何高价，对我来说都只是一个数字而已。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她天然地意识到，她这一代的女性艺术家，但凡在事业上取得一点进步，就必然要替全体女性发声。 “女性艺术家加上年少成名，别人很容易就会说：是不是因为你的容貌？是不是你背后有什么人在帮你抬价格？”女性不可能仅凭实力就取得成功吗？承认女性优秀很难吗？孙一钿的回击之道，就是用更全面的自我强大令他们闭嘴，这是从小到大一路当优等生建立起来的自信，也是她重返校园读博的动力之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在她工作室墙上钉着的诸多草稿中，有几幅充满力量感的高跟鞋小稿，猩红色高跟鞋的鞋头并在一起，跟分立两侧的鞋跟拼成一副女性骨盆的形状。孙一钿一直记得少女时代读过的某个台湾男诗人的诗，写的是女孩子脚蹬高跟鞋时的感受——“世界矮了七厘米”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙一钿身高1米72，踩上7厘米的人造高跟鞋，比很多男性都高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一个矮了七厘米的世界里，她继续向前走。 &lt;/p>;

During the dinner, I accidentally talked about the misfortune of Nie Er, the composer of &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; The place of drowning - the coast of Shonan in Fujisawa Prefecture, Japan. Wang Zhongyi, the editor-in-chief of &quot;People&#39;s China&quot; magazine, asked me about the relationship between Shonan and Naito Hunan and Hunan Province. I knew what was going on but didn&#39;t know why. I was questioned on the spot. So, after returning home and doing some homework, I came up with this fake &quot;place name test&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;891&quot; height= &quot;1185&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255549&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Japanese Sinologist Naito Konan (1866-1934). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the latter first. The relationship between Naito Hunan and Hunan Province is simple, so simple that there is no half-cent relationship. Naito&#39;s halo as a sinologist is so dazzling that when Chinese people talk about this legendary figure, they often make associations: the &quot;Hunan&quot; in Naito&#39;s name must have been &quot;taken&quot; from Hunan Province, and is intentionally or unintentionally reminiscent of When it comes to the &quot;theory of cultural center movement&quot; and the &quot;theory of changes in the Tang and Song Dynasties&quot;, it seems that if you don&#39;t even &quot;roll&quot; your name, you can&#39;t be called a great scholar. However, Japanese intellectuals are mostly limited by the concept of regionalism and take it for granted. Since he is a leader of the Kyoto School, the name &quot;Hunan&quot; must come from Hunan City in Shiga Prefecture adjacent to Kyoto Prefecture, but this lake is not Dongting Lake, but Lake Biwa. In fact, neither of these two arguments is correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Naito Hunan&#39;s name is Tiger Jiro, whose courtesy name is Bingqing and whose nickname is Hunan. In 1866, he was born in Mamauchi Village, Mutsu Province (now Mamauchi, Towada, Shikaku City, Akita Prefecture). Shikaku is located at the northernmost tip of Akita Prefecture, separated from Aomori Prefecture by the boundary lake &quot;Lake Towada&quot;. &quot;Hunan&quot; means the south of Lake Towada. Lake Towada is a double volcanic lake formed by the eruption of the Towada volcano. It has beautiful scenery and is a famous lake in the Tohoku region. It is listed as a &quot;National Cultural Property&quot; as a special scenic spot. In the National Diet Building in the center of Tokyo, huge oil paintings depicting the four seasons of the Japanese archipelago hang on the walls surrounding the central hall. Among them, the summer work is &quot;Lake Towada and Oirase&quot; painted by Tanaka Giichi. In this way, due to the influence of Naito&#39;s Hunan and Kyoto schools, Hunan Province, which was originally out of reach, was forced to be disconnected. Even Hunan City, Shiga Prefecture, which had nothing to do with it, was attached to some kind of connection with Naito, and Naito Lake Towada, my hometown where I grew up, is not mentioned by the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height= &quot;403&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255550&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The oil painting &quot;Lake Towada and Oirase&quot; hanging in the central hall of the Japanese Diet Building. Oirase is a river flowing from Lake Towada. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the former. There is actually no definite conclusion about the connection between Shonan and Hunan Province. Although the interpretation of &quot;Southern Hunan&quot; in &quot;Guangciyuan&quot; (fifth edition) refers to it, it is not clear: ① The name of the scenic spot south of the Xiangjiang River that flows into Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, China. ② The &quot;Sōnan&quot; in the southern part of the ancient Sagami Kingdom was appended to ① and written as &quot;Shonan&quot; as the name for the coastal area of ​​Sagami Bay. That area includes Hayama, Zushi, Kamakura, Chigasaki and other areas. There are many bathing beaches in the summer, making it a summer resort for Keihin. The winter is relatively warm. It is widely developed as residential land. For example, &quot;Shonan Electric Railway&quot; is the general name of the old national railways that connect Tokyo and Numazu (Shizuoka Prefecture) over a medium distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through this explanation, we understand that without Hunan in China, there would be no Shonan in Japan. The next question is: when and how did this spatial &quot;link&quot; occur? In Japan, the expression &quot;Shonan&quot; was first seen in the dictionary &quot;Wa Ming Le Ju Chao&quot; (referred to as &quot;Wa Ming Chao&quot; or &quot;Wa Ming Chao&quot;) in the middle of the Heian period. The etymology is Shonan County, Changsha State. According to the explanation of &quot;Zizhi Tongjian Dictionary&quot; (Jilin People&#39;s Publishing House, 1994): Xiangnan County was &quot;established in the Western Han Dynasty, and its administrative location is southwest of Xiangtan City, Hunan Province. It was changed to the Marquis of Xiangnan in the Eastern Han Dynasty. In the Three Kingdoms, Wu restored it to Xiangnan County. The Southern Dynasties Waste all.&quot; However, &quot;Shonan&quot; in &quot;Japanese Names&quot; is still a simple ancient Chinese place name and is not equivalent to &quot;Shonan&quot; in Japan today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Various evidence shows that the real &quot;crossing of the border&quot; in southern Hunan is related to Zen Buddhism. Mr. Ge Zhaoguang mentioned in &quot;The History of Chinese Zen Thought&quot; that Southern Zen is divided into two branches geographically, and the second branch is the &quot;Zen master group centered on Jingzhou and Hengyue&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, Fa Nao and Fa Ren of Jingzhou Emperor Temple, Fa Jing and Zhiyuan of Changsha Temple, Fa Cong of Xiangyang Jingkong Temple, Lushan Fa Chong wait. Of course, the most important thing is Huisi (515-577) who first went to Daesu Mountain in Gwangju and then to Hengyue, and opened the later Tiantai line. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tiantai Sect is the sect that has had a decisive influence on Japanese Buddhism and Zen Buddhism. In 804 AD, Zen Master Saicho went to the Tang Dynasty to study Dharma as an envoy to the Tang Dynasty. After returning to China the following year, he taught Dharma at the Enryaku Temple on Mount Hiei (also known as Mount Tiantai), and then founded the Tendai Sect of Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Muxi Fachang, a painting monk from the late Song Dynasty to the early Yuan Dynasty (Fachang is the Buddhist name, his birth and death dates are unknown), practiced Zen under the famous monk Wu Zhun when he was young, and later became the founder of Liutong Temple in West Lake. At the end of the Kamakura period (14th century), his paintings flowed into Japan in batches following the exchanges between Chinese and Japanese Zen masters, and they were immediately enthusiastically sought after by the upper class. The technique of using ink halos and a large amount of white space to express the beauty of the universe is superb and sophisticated. It is the &quot;symbol of the literati&#39;s longing for an utopia of natural mountains and rivers&quot; in the eyes of the Japanese (Japanese scholar Yuji Yamashita said), and it has also profoundly influenced Japan. of southern painting. The great Japanese painting masters of the Momoyama period, Hasegawa Tōhoku, Omotaya Sotatsu and others, all sought the foundation of ink painting techniques from Makiki&#39;s paintings; there are also many works that imitated Makiki in the Kano School of art. Muxi&#39;s paintings are the objects of collection by Japanese ministers, daimyo and wealthy businessmen. They are national treasures among national treasures. For example, in the &quot;Catalog of Imperial Paintings&quot;, a record of the painting treasures collected by the Ashikaga family of the Muromachi shogunate, of the total 280 pieces in the collection, Makixi&#39;s works accounted for 30%, as many as 103 pieces. In Japanese documents from the mid-14th century, if only &quot;monk&quot; is written, it is an honorific title for Muxi. Muxi&#39;s paintings are almost extinct in China (only the National Palace Museum and the National Palace Museum in Taipei hold one each). It is said that 134 paintings exist in Japan, all of which are stored in the treasure collections of the Cabinet Office for Culture and the country&#39;s first-class art museums. The &quot;ceiling&quot; of Mu Xi&#39;s work is generally recognized as &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot;. Seven of the eight volumes are in Japan. The location of the remaining volume, &quot;Yamaichi Seiran&quot;, is still unknown and a copy is preserved in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;3197&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255548&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Fishing Village Sunset&quot; from Muxi Fachang&#39;s &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;Xiaoxiang&quot;, the definition of &quot;Cihai&quot; is: ①Another name for the Xiangjiang River, because the water of the Xiangjiang River is clear Well-earned reputation. &quot;The Book of Mountains and Seas·Zhongshan Jing&quot;: &quot;The abyss of the Xiaoxiang River.&quot; &quot;The Book of Xiangzhong&quot;: &quot;The clear light of the Xiangchuan River is five or six feet long, which is the name of Xiaoxiang.&quot; Or it may specifically refer to the section after the middle reaches of the Xiangjiang River meets the Xiaoshui River. That is one of the &quot;Three Hunans&quot;. ②Refers generally to the Hunan region. Zheng Gu&#39;s poem &quot;Farewell to Friends on Huaishang&quot;: &quot;Several bagpipes left the pavilion at night, you went to Xiaoxiang and I went to Qin.&quot; ③The name of the ancient town. It was placed in the Five Dynasties in the northwest of Yongzhou City, Hunan Province. It is named because it is the confluence of Xiaoxiang River and Xiangkou Pass; it is also called Xiaoxiang Pass or Xiangkou Pass. Accordingly, as the name suggests, the &quot;Eight Scenic Spots of Xiaoxiang&quot; refer to the eight scenic spots from the north along the Xiangjiang River to Dongting Lake after the Xiangjiang River merges into the Xiaoshui River. Since the Northern Song Dynasty, some painters have used it as a theme to create works, expressing their feelings for the landscape. The &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; has almost become an artistic paradigm. Famous ones include the scroll of the same name by Song Di, which was later written down by Shen Kuo in &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot;, including Fan Return from Yuanpu, Falling Geese on Pingsha, Evening Bell of Yansi Temple, Qinglan in Mountain City, Dusk Snow in River Sky, Autumn Moon in Dongting, Sunset in Fishing Village, Xiaoxiang Night Talk - the name of &quot;Eight Scenes&quot;, has since &quot;out of the circle&quot;. However, compared with the works of Song Di and others, the Japanese clearly prefer Mu Xi. As for the reason, the philosopher Han Bingzhe believes:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mu Xi&#39;s &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; inspired by Zen Buddhism is also &quot; The picture of &quot;empty&quot;, the pen and ink are simple and subtle, there is nothingness, the artistic conception is mysterious, a few scenes are hidden in the infinite white space, the careful brushwork makes the objects float between reality and virtuality, black and white, and there is no way to express it. meaning. Objects and images are integrated and dependent on each other, reflecting each other instead of driving away or dividing each other. Sora seems to have become a friendly intermediary. Water lives, mountains flow, heaven and earth unite. The emptiness and silence do not obliterate the still life in the painting, but reflect the elegance of the still life. (&quot;Zen Philosophy&quot;, page 35)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, from the Kamakura period to the Edo period, from the Ashikaga Shogun family (Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Yoshimasa) to Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, from the Tokugawa Shogun family (Tokugawa Ieyasu, Yoshimune) to Matsudaira Fumo and Murata Shuguang, Muxi&#39;s &quot;Eight Views of Xiaoxiang&quot; has been circulated among these figures, and its value can no longer be evaluated in terms of money. The Japanese really love the &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; so much that they can&#39;t wait to move them to Japan. Sure enough, later the Japanese &quot;discovered&quot; the &quot;Eight Views of Kanazawa&quot; in the area of ​​Rokuura Village in Musashi Kunakurajo County (today&#39;s Kanazawa Eight Views Station of the Keihin Express Railway) - the whole is a &quot;Hako Garden&quot; version of the &quot;Eight Views of Xiaoxiang&quot; . The wonderful thing is that every scenic spot corresponds to the original scenery of Xiaoxiang, and it was adapted into Ukiyo-e paintings by Utagawa Hiroshige, including &quot;The Return of the Sailing Ship&quot;, &quot;The Falling Geese&quot;, &quot;The Evening Bell&quot;, &quot;Susaki Haru&quot; &quot;Arashi&quot;, &quot;Twilight Snow on Uchigawa&quot;, &quot;Seto Autumn Moon&quot;, &quot;Sunset on Noshima&quot; and &quot;Koizumi&#39;s Night Voice&quot;, a total of eight paintings. In the 7th year of Yuanlu (1694), Zen Master Donggao Xinyue, who fled to Japan from the Ming Dynasty, wrote a Chinese poem for each of the &quot;Eight Scenes of Kanze&quot;. With the endorsement of the seven-character quatrains of the Chinese great scholar, Kanze was like Xiaoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that in the early Edo period, the monk Sawuan began to call the Enoshima area &quot;Shonan&quot;. During the same period, Chongxue, a descendant of the Chinese who immigrated to Japan from China during the Muromachi period and an expectorant medicine merchant in Odawara, built a stone tablet at the Oiso nunnery, on which he engraved the seven words &quot;The end of the Qing Dynasty in southern Hunan&quot;. This monument still exists today and is regarded as the beginning of place names in southern Hunan. Before modern times, Sinology was always a prominent school in Japan. Therefore, whether it was due to a certain literary taste or arty elegance, there were many Zen monks and poets who used &quot;Shonan&quot; as their nickname, such as the Zen monk Shonan Tong, the poet Okubo Shonan, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the opening of the Shonan Electric Railway, the area known as &quot;Shonan&quot; further expanded, and even the Miura Peninsula was included in its division. In May of the 29th year of Meiji (1896), Tokutomi Soho bought a villa on the Zushi Seaside for his parents, and then handed over the task of taking care of the two elders to his younger brother Tokutomi Akasha, and he embarked on a journey around the world. At that time, Luhua was physically and mentally exhausted and tired of the dissolute life. She decided to temporarily go to her parents&#39; villa to live in seclusion while thinking about her future. He wrote in a letter to his brother: &quot;The air in Tokyo is too cold for me. I want to live in Shonan for some time.&quot; At that time, Shonan had become a residential area for the upper class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also at about the same time, Natsume Soseki and Suzuki Daijo each practiced Zen under Enkaku-ji Temple in Kita-Kamakura with the Zen master Shaksumi. Soseki practiced Zen for self-healing, while Dachu practiced Zen for the purpose of learning the Dharma. Time and space intersect, the two have neither the same purpose nor have they met. Since the Kamakura shogunate era, the shogunate rulers have been protected by the clan, and Zen Buddhism has been able to live and develop here. After five centuries of development, by the time Soseki and Daijo practiced Zen, it had become a grand sight. Kamakura, an ancient temple, was lined with many The ancient city, which is full of Zen, has also become a true &quot;Mecca&quot; of Zen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, from the &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; by Muxi Fachang to the &quot;Eight Scenes of Kanze&quot;, from monk Ze&#39;an to the Chinese Zen master who fled eastward, it can be said that it is precisely because of the blessing of Zen Buddhism that This long and narrow coastal area, centered on Enoshima and extending east and west along Sagami Bay, has changed from the ancient place name &quot;Sōnan&quot; to the &quot;Shonan&quot; in the eyes of the world today. It has a unique atmosphere that is completely different from other regions. Romantic style. For example, if people living in the metropolitan area drive a car with a &quot;Shonan&quot; license plate on National Highway 134 on weekends, even if it is just an ordinary light motor vehicle, it is still a cool thing. Its &quot;gold content&quot; even surpasses the high-end residential area &quot;Shinagawa&quot; in Tokyo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（原题“何处是湘南”，现标题为编者所拟）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[学术期刊为何能收那么贵的版面费？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259320]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, an accounting journal in Hubei Province, &quot;Accounting Newsletter&quot;, issued a notice stating that authors who raise families with three children No publishing fee. This was originally a very niche academic journal, and the notice itself could reach a relatively small number of people, but it quickly aroused heated discussion on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reasons for the heated discussion can be attributed to the following aspects: firstly, the page fee of six to seven thousand yuan for an article is not cheap; secondly, the positioning of this journal, which was led by the Hubei Provincial Accountant Sponsored by the Society and directed by the Hubei Provincial Federation of Social Science and Technology, charging high page fees feels more like a commercial practice; the last is this preferential measure, which is very high-profile, but in fact the number of beneficiaries may be very few and can almost be ignored. , it feels more like a promotion. It’s not surprising that the combination of several factors has made it a hot spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I have always known that there is a page fee for publishing papers in academic journals, it is somewhat surprising that the fee for an article is so high. According to its official website, there are 31 articles in the latest issue of the catalog. This journal is published bimonthly. Based on the page fee of 6,000 per article, their monthly income can reach 372,000 yuan, which is 4,464,000 yuan a year. The annual income of a journal is nearly 5 million, which is definitely a good business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the important reasons is that the world has been undergoing a &quot;Great Leap Forward in Higher Education&quot; in recent decades, and the accompanying &quot;paper inflation&quot; behind it. Because China has a large population base and rapid economic development, problems in this area are particularly prominent. It&#39;s just that most of the people involved are &quot;literary people&quot; and are more or less &quot;beneficiaries&quot;. Even if they see the problem, they will not easily pierce this layer of window paper. After all, seeing through but not telling off is also a well-known survival wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the academic qualification inflation is the expansion of undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students. Major universities attach great importance to the number of papers, and basically require graduate students to publish a corresponding number of papers before graduation. Usually, the better the school, the higher the requirements for the level of papers. Every year, students apply to postpone graduation because they have not completed the publication of their thesis. Thesis publication is a necessity for the research community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the expansion of undergraduate and graduate enrollment will inevitably be accompanied by an expansion of the number of teachers. Throughout the education system, there is a tradition of assessing the number of published papers. There are rigid regulations that require publication of papers when promoting teachers&#39; professional titles, applying for scientific research projects, or applying for various scientific research funds. And it’s not just universities that require essays, even primary and secondary schools now have requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the education system, but also hospitals and even some units that are not scientific research institutions will use the number of published papers as an important indicator for promotion. One of the considerations is probably because it seems fair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another consideration is a certain sense of &quot;academic worship&quot;, or &quot;science worship&quot;, as if publishing a paper is making a contribution to scientific scholarship. In fact, for a long time, many places and universities in our country have been pursuing and promoting the &quot;only patents and number of papers theory&quot;. The number of papers and patents has always been the focus of their propaganda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early August this year, the research institute of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan released a report. The report shows that China’s total number of papers accounts for 24.6% of the global share, 8.5 percentage points higher than the second-placed United States. In terms of the number of citations used to measure the quality of papers, China’s global proportions of “attention papers” and “top papers” were 28.9% and 29.3% respectively, ranking first in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We don’t need to belittle ourselves and regard this kind of data ranking as worthless. Objectively speaking, on the one hand, this data shows that China’s scientific research and academic influence is gradually expanding, which is a good thing. But on the other hand, we must also see the contrast between this quantity and reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We often say that &quot;quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes&quot;, but when the number of papers and patents is distorted by the wrong incentive system, quantitative changes may not lead to high-quality qualitative changes. On the contrary, it is more likely to lead to low-level, low-level duplication, and also produce some bizarre &quot;academic research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a few years ago, an academic journal published &quot;It is expected to improve the efficiency of building a clean government culture by targeting intestinal flora to regulate the body&#39;s material needs and desires.&quot; There are many more articles of this kind, which are completely unabashedly &quot;pseudo-academic&quot; and just to make up for the numbers. Under the improper incentive system, publishing papers has become a necessity for many people, and it is a very large &quot;market&quot;. The demand is strong but the supply is limited. There are only so many publications and so many pages, so it basically forms a &quot;seller&#39;s market&quot;, and it is not surprising that the page fees are high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With high prices and huge profits, more people will definitely participate, so this forms an &quot;essay industry chain.&quot; There are writers, there are agents, there are people who are responsible for paying, and there are people who are responsible for publishing. You can basically find various channels as long as you pay. Of course, this &quot;market&quot; is not completely spontaneous, but is caused by a deformed incentive system. Moreover, under this deformity, corruption is likely to breed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Wu Dongfeng, the former editor-in-chief of Qiusuo magazine of the Hunan Academy of Social Sciences, was placed under investigation for serious disciplinary violations. The problem lies precisely in the publication fee. Later, the court determined that Wu Dongfeng had charged nearly 10 million yuan in &quot;page fee&quot; for his paper. The &quot;page fee&quot; for publishing an article in &quot;Qiusuo&quot; magazine can reach up to more than 50,000 yuan, and there are intermediaries responsible for blending these matters. At that time, this case caused great shock in the academic community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to such corruption cases and problems, the &quot;paper industry&quot; has another problem, and that is the &quot;siphon effect.&quot; People in this &quot;industrial chain&quot; were supposed to create wealth, but instead they became &quot;paper brokers&quot;, helping others publish worthless articles to make profits. And some page fees are reimbursed at public expense. Except for those articles that are truly valuable, I am afraid that most of the junk articles are essentially &quot;conspiring to divide the spoils&quot; among many people. Some of them may be dividing taxpayers&#39; money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to change the status quo, I am afraid it is not a headache for the doctor. Not to ask why the page fee is so high, but to ask why so many worthless journals and articles can still live so well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[那些在互联网买“情绪”的年轻人，拜托醒醒吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259422]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;957&quot; height=&quot;637&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people may have heard the melody of &quot;love trading&quot;, but they don&#39;t know that there is also a business of &quot;emotional trading&quot; now. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Emotional Tree Hole&quot;, &quot;Good Luck Spray&quot;, &quot;Scolding to Awaken Love Brain&quot;, &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot;... Nowadays, many young people are keen on As for purchasing emotional products online, there are more and more emotional products that can be purchased for just a few dollars. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, when you have an emotional breakdown, you can buy a chat service online, talk to strangers, complain a few words, and your negative emotions seem to be released; place an order for a &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot; , there will be sellers role-playing who will &quot;buzz&quot; you from time to time; after breaking up, buy a copy of &quot;Scolding to Awaken Your Love Brain&quot;, and strangers will be your &quot;chat partners&quot; and treat you rationally and rationally. Move with emotion...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why are young people keen on buying emotions on the Internet? Can buying emotions really provide emotional value? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Young people are “emo” &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Behind the purchasing emotions are the emotions of many young people Emotion has encountered some &quot;problems&quot;. To use a popular word nowadays, it is &quot;emo&quot;. Emo was selected as the Internet Word of the Year in 2021. In this year alone, Bilibili users sent &quot;emo&quot; barrages 3.3 million times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;emo&quot; comes from the English word &quot;emotion&quot;, which means emotion. In the 1990s, &quot;emotional hardcore&quot; appeared in the field of European and American pop music, which is a kind of rock music with delicate emotions, melancholy and sentimentality. After being simplified to &quot;emo&quot;, emo also has colors such as impulsiveness, sensitivity, and melancholy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo, which is now a popular vocabulary, continues this core and emotional color, representing the decadent, frustrated, speechless and puzzled mood of young people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo has become a popular word not only because of the principle of &quot;language economics&quot; - this short word accurately summarizes the mentality of young people, and it is not just popular. The &quot;herding effect&quot; in the spread of vocabulary - you use it for other people and I use it for you. What&#39;s more, emo is indeed a universal emotion of the times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo is a new variant of the previously popular words such as &quot;Buddhist&quot;, &quot;mourning&quot; and &quot;lying flat&quot;. It is related to some new changes of the times. For example, in the post-epidemic era, the global economy is recovering slowly and the economic downturn has put young people under greater work pressure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people feel very tired under the &quot;involution&quot;; in the busy urban life, many young people do not have much time to socialize and stay in rental houses after work Here, they will inevitably feel lonely and cold as &quot;empty-nest youths&quot;... In addition to these universal dilemmas, young people also have different and specific confusions in their own lives, which more or less affect their emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In short, young people can emo about everything. I can&#39;t find a job, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m under great pressure at work, I&#39;m emo; I have a conflict with my partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m single and have no partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m not ready for the exam, I&#39;m emo; my plan was rejected by Party A, I&#39;m emo...&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Compared with words such as mourning and lying down, emo has a hint of self-deprecation of joy in suffering. It is not so negative and pessimistic, but after complaining about &quot;I am really emo&quot; , will still clean up the mess of life and move on. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;The comfort of &quot;emotional value&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After emo, you still have to embrace life. Therefore, young people will work hard to calm down their emotions faster and satisfy their emotional needs. They will seek &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, what is emotional value? Simply put, emotional value = positive emotion (benefit) - negative emotion (cost). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Whether a thing or a person has emotional value lies in its ability to bring positive emotional power to people, such as making people feel happy, secure, calm, and warm. , healing... In other words, emotional value is the ability to have a positive impact on our emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be companionship, sharing, listening, encouragement... In the end, it becomes a kind of comfort for emo emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On social media, young people also often use words closely related to emotional value, such as &quot;emotional stability&quot;, which has become the first criterion for many young people to choose a partner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;An emotionally stable partner can always handle things calmly and calmly, without losing control, without blaming each other, and without blaming each other, but working hard to solve problems. A partner who is emotionally stable will naturally bring strong emotional value to others - you will be wrapped in a sense of security, and no matter how chaotic the world is, there will be someone walking hand in hand with you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;With this background, we can understand why many young people buy emotions on the Internet. What they essentially buy is &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If a person has no motivation to study, just join the &quot;virtual study room&quot;, and everyone will study together to have more atmosphere; if you want an illusion of good luck, buy &quot;Good &quot;Yuck Koi&quot;; if you want to get rid of loneliness and gain a sense of companionship, you can place an order for &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, where a seller will role-play a mosquito and &quot;buzz&quot; you from time to time; buy it after a breakup A &quot;scolding to wake up your love brain&quot; is not so much about scolding you as it is about accompanying you, talking to you, and listening to you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;794&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255731 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Not want to buy Just buy it&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is human nature that people like people and things that can provide high emotional value. Keen merchants have also seized this business opportunity - young people need emotional value, and I will sell emotional value. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The question is, can you really buy emotional value if you want to? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If emotional value was such an easy thing to obtain, it wouldn’t be so scarce. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As mentioned above, emotional value is a kind of &quot;ability&quot;. It must really hit your emo point, bring you strength, comfort and help you. You transcend that depression. This is not something you can achieve by typing in a dialog box and the other party saying a few words of chicken soup for the soul; it is not something you can achieve by buying a &quot;Good Luck Koi&quot; or &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot; and you will be blessed with divine help. Falling from the sky; it’s not the other party “inciting emotions”, you will be emotionally liberated...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, those &quot;sell&quot; products on the Internet for a few cents or a few dollars &quot;Emotion&quot; is just a gimmick. The sellers do not have the quality and ability to provide emotional value. They are even more routine and perfunctory than the customer service of some merchants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What young people buy is only a few minutes of freshness, which brings a few minutes of fun to the emo mood. Once the freshness is over, the emo is still the emo, and the problem has not been solved. If so, it&#39;s still not resolved. It&#39;s OK to think of &quot;emotional trading&quot; as a joke, but if you take it seriously, you may be deceived and make you more emo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the final analysis, if there is no one or thing to rely on, then the only one who can bring positive emotional value to yourself is yourself. If you haven&#39;t studied for a long time and feel that you have fallen, you will feel emo, and you think that joining the &quot;virtual study room&quot; will give you motivation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, such heteronomy is in vain. If you have more self-discipline and complete the goals you set every day, you will feel real happiness the moment you complete it - the better. Self-discipline brings freedom; if you don’t work hard at ordinary times, you will feel emo before the exam. You think buying a &quot;good luck koi&quot; will bring you good luck, but you still won’t during the exam. If you study hard and concentrate on preparing for the exam, you will Your hard work will be reflected in the exam, and what you gain is a real sense of solidity and accomplishment...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After all, the value of emotions cannot be bought just because you want to buy them. Buying emotions is a pleasure. Yes, but getting out of emo cannot rely solely on spiritual victory. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《芭蕾舞复仇曲》：韩影越来越套路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259234]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;Among the new generation of Korean actresses, all Zhong Rui is an alternative existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She made her fortune in Li Cangdong&#39;s &quot;Burning&quot;.

The cunning and alienation on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s face, her inadvertent dodge, and a hint of cowardice constitute her rich facial aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her new work &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, she once again demonstrates this highly recognizable performance style. This is her second collaboration with emerging director Li Chongxian. The first time the two worked together was in the 2020 crime suspense film &quot;The Call&quot;, which caused heated discussions among movie fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Ballet In &quot;Revenge Song&quot;, although Jeon Jong-seo is not as crazy as in &quot;Telephone&quot;, the girl she plays, Ok-joo, is also a mistress who is not easy to mess with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Zhu once worked as a bodyguard in a security company, specializing in protecting high-level important personnel.

The latter&#39;s natural affinity frees Yuzhu from the boring quagmire of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to show the contrast in atmosphere, the film specially uses colorful soft light to capture the relaxed and graceful friendship between the two girls when showing Minxi taking Yuzhu to celebrate her birthday, taking headshots and relaxing on the beach. . This is in contrast to the large number of night scenes and indoor scenes throughout the film, which basically use high contrast and low-key lighting to create dangerous and uneasy situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255248&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point of the story , appeared when Minxi suddenly committed suicide, leaving a last word hoping that Yuzhu would help her take revenge. After Yuzhu followed the clues and found a man named &quot;Chef Cui&quot;, she discovered that Minxi&#39;s suicide had a lot to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The many &quot;SM&quot; props in Chef Cui&#39;s home, as well as the large number of classified USB flash drives in the cabinet, all show that in the process of &quot;hunting for beauty&quot;, he often uses perverted methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;444&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255250&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And Minxi , after being targeted by Chef Cui, he was drugged and raped while being filmed on video.

He also has a pharmacist who regularly cooperates with him, so he can succeed every time with drugs such as &quot;obedient water&quot;; his subordinates also run a peach store.

The prisoner in the case, Zhao Zhubin, established a paid &quot;room&quot; on an online platform and used the threatened girls as bargaining chips to profit from it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s just that this film introduces gangster forces and makes sexual crimes bottomless, in order to amplify this despair and anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some time ago, &quot;The Voice of Freedom&quot;, which was adapted from real events, brought to the table the rarely mentioned child abduction and sex trafficking. Although the quality of the film is not good, its discussion of this topic is worthy of recognition. It allows us to see a criminal phenomenon that is deep underground and widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, as Yuzhu deepens her investigation into Chef Cui and the organization behind him, she also only avenges her best friend at the beginning, but gradually transforms into avenging the victimized woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, The killing scenes and action scenes have become the second highlight of this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jeon Jong-seo cannot rely on physical confrontation and impact to create visual stimulation like Stallone and Jason Statham, nor can he use real kung fu techniques like Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Show off a pleasing figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The action design of &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; absorbs the style of the &quot;John Wick&quot; series, that is, it gives full play to the advantages of &quot;gun-shaped&quot; action movies, allowing hot weapons and fists and kicks to be used alternately. Ammunition can create explosive scenes, and the head-on confrontation of fists, feet, knives and axes can highlight the thrilling effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255253&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is at the climax In the scene, Yuzhu used two pistols to fight against the entire gang, which was most obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this alone cannot make up for Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s complement in action scenes, so lens language and editing techniques have become necessary auxiliary means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quick swinging technique, the movement of the camera synchronized with the direction of the punch, and the extensive use of close-up and close-up shots, coupled with the fast and sharp editing style, make the entire movie have a clear rhythm every time it enters the action section. Accelerate and the atmosphere becomes wanton and arrogant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;449&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the director Li Chongxian is familiar with action films such as Hong Kong&#39;s &quot;The Fuse&quot;, Indonesia&#39;s &quot;The Raid&quot; and South Korea&#39;s &quot;Crime City&quot;, so he can create these action scenes with ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the tilted and unbalanced camera images and the neon aesthetics with great color contrast make &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; closer to the style of Hollywood crime films in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;448&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general In other words, the crime theme of exploiting women&#39;s bodies, good fighting scenes, and Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s character arc that is sometimes conservative and restrained, sometimes sensitive and angry, make this film have a sense of entertainment that is above the pass mark. However, when we finish watching &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, we can still detect its frivolity and frivolity based on big data algorithms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the character Ok-joo&#39;s emotions continue to deepen in the process of revenge, this delicate inner change relies more on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s outstanding performance. Why did she become a bodyguard? Why are you so depressed in life? The film never explains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255255&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for her being Min Xi is infected and her heart gradually melts, but it is like going through the motions, and the filming is stereotyped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most puzzling thing is the pretentiousness of the underworld gang, which is strong on the outside but capable on the inside. The boss, who is full of gangster traditions, did not see anything done after he lectured Chef Cui. He neither saw through Chef Cui’s lies nor demonstrated his strategizing of the organization. Only in the contrasting section of &quot;die from talking too much&quot; does it play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255257&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; provides a framework for female revenge, especially in terms of revenge for best friends. It is exactly the same as the summer hit &quot;The Vanishing She&quot;. But when it comes to the specific levels of criminal psychology, social ecology, etc., it seems to be discouraged. It is not like Luo Hongzhen&#39;s &quot;Yellow Sea&quot;, which separates the dirty, angry and restless characters&#39; psychology and shows you in detail. Instead, it provides a visual pleasure for immediate consumption and caters to the public&#39;s emotional fast food. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the inevitable result of Netflix and other streaming media entering the Korean market. It has brought big data arithmetic and more routine formulas, and this may also become a trend in the next few years. , a signal of an overall decline in the quality of Korean films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
