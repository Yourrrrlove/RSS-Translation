But twenty or thirty years later, since Brexit, Trump’s rise to power, and right-wing parties winning elections around the world, political scientists are talking about the decline of democracy, both trying to explain why (as Fukuyama puts it in his book Identity Politics) Identity analyzes how disadvantaged communities thrive), while also continuing to defend democracy (e.g. Przewski&#39;s Why Bother with Elections?). Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor also co-authored a new book with two scholars, &quot;Degenerations of Democracy&quot; (Harvard University Press, 2022), which adds to the literature that has emerged in recent years on the decline of democracy. , adding another important book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before talking about the new book, let me first explain the background. Taylor wrote a masterpiece, &quot;A Secular Age&quot;, analyzing how the Western world evolved from the medieval era when &quot;no god was necessary&quot; to a secular era where God was &quot;all-powerful&quot;. The world experienced a helpless time. The historical process of looking back. Recognizing that history moves forward (rather than repeating ebbs and flows) is equally important to understanding the decline of democracy today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as in the new book, the authors led by Taylor describe today&#39;s democracy as a &quot;degenerate&quot; rather than a &quot;retreat&quot;. To clarify the difference between the two words, the point I want to explain is that With the qualitative change of the democratic system, it will no longer be able to return to &quot;normal&quot; as before. It will not be regarded as the &quot;golden rule&quot; as before (that is, democratic countries have a transcendent status but non-democratic countries are eager to imitate it). The kind of system that was once The &quot;good days of democracy&quot; that briefly appeared are long gone from a global perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another focus of the author in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; is to define democracy as a telic concept. In other words: democracy is an ideal situation, but the world can never be so ideally democratic (It is defined by standards that can never be met). To move towards democracy, elections are certainly one of the keys, but the presence of elections certainly does not mean democracy (just like the lack of rotation of political parties in Japan does not mean the lack of local democracy), democratic elections must have the two qualities of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; Big conditions. In reality, there is never true and ultimate freedom and fairness, but there is often the possibility of being a little freer and a little fairer. Similarly, the author regards democracy as a goal in the book, either getting closer to democracy or moving further and further away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like other scholars of democratic theory, Taylor and other authors in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; also hope to explain why the current world is contrary to democracy, and their answer is that the public has lost a kind of will that will change tomorrow. People feel they are deprived of the ability to make good lives for themselves and their families, so the public no longer has clear ideological preferences as before, but it is easier to resort to emotions and vent their dissatisfaction in life. Complaining collectively in small groups has become the greatest comfort in life. This is called populism. It is against this background that the democratic system has gradually changed from the past where everyone competed to pursue their own interests (agonistic), into an antagonistic arena. This is what the author calls the decline of democracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to ask how a democratic system can be brought back to life, the key must be to analyze the cause of death. The fundamental reason for the decline of the democratic system is the loss of the people&#39;s trust. If no one trusts any system, politics and political-related figures will only be hated by gods and ghosts. The author believes that ideal democracy is practiced through representative politics, that is, the people vote for political parties and authorize the formation of the government. The government is elected by one person and one vote. Everyone has a &quot;share&quot;, and the government therefore needs to be accountable to the people. However, scholars such as Charles Taylor revealed the miserable situation of democracy in the real world in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In political research, the decline of the democratic system and the people&#39;s indifference or even disgust with politics are not something that has only happened in recent years. It is only the situation that has taken a turn for the worse in recent years that has attracted more attention. The situation is exactly like global warming. It has been talked about for decades, but in recent years it has really started to feel like it has burned its heels. So now more people are coming out to speak out for the earth, but we know that the distance problem will be alleviated (let alone solved). The volume is still far from enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for democratic systems. The voting rates in old Western democracies have been low for decades, and political party support has also been deteriorating. Behind these things is that the democratic system and the people are getting further and further apart. The death of democracy will have as much impact on the world as global warming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;, the three authors describe the failed democratic system in reality: social inequality is infinitely magnified through the democratic system, and power and wealth are concentrated in a very small number of people. Regularly held elections and the political parties participating in them are to blame. The political parties themselves enjoy it, but (most) people don&#39;t actually feel it. Social development has become more diverse, but representative political parties have been unable to keep up. The opposition between left and right has left the people feeling indifferent. Political parties no longer represent the people, and a sense of powerlessness has enveloped the public. This is the key point that the author emphasizes repeatedly in the book: the people have lost their sense of accomplishment (efficacy). Who wants to get involved in politics when the “sacred vote” is effectively optional? The people&#39;s inefficacy is both the cause and the result of the decline of the democratic system. All problems are intertwined to form a vicious cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the system is incompetent and useless, populism, which allows people to share the same hatred and hatred, becomes extremely attractive. However, the author emphasizes very much in the book: populism is not the cause of the decline of democratic systems. Populism does indeed grow stronger when the democratic system is at its most fragile, but don’t forget that populism originally relied on the democratic system and mass mobilization. Forcibly treating populism as the biggest enemy actually ignores the root of the problem. If the democratic system is to be revived and active again, the most important thing to do is to re-inject a sense of achievement into the people and make them believe that the vote in their hands is not a piece of waste paper, but that they can really make a difference because of their vote. And elect a government that is responsible for itself and the country, but how to do it and is it possible? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In their book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;, Taylor and others wrote that the democratic system was beyond recovery, but the great philosophers did not just end it irresponsibly. Before they concluded, they wrote that it might be The most important chapter of the book, &quot;What to do?&quot; attempts to propose four life-saving methods for the declining democratic system. I will briefly summarize them here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The primary method is to restart democracy (Renew the Democratic Project). To put it simply and concisely, it is to re-respect the people of every country, because as mentioned before, one of the main reasons for the decline of democracy is that the people feel powerless and angry. For democracy to become an effective system, it must first make the people believe that they are part of the country again. That is to say, everyone&#39;s social background, blood culture, ideology and beliefs can be different, but the premise is that everyone should have the most basic and important thing in common - national identity, and use this identity to identify and transcend. and accommodate their differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it is extremely difficult to achieve mutual respect between people. If you look at the long-standing card of &quot;immigration&quot; in Western countries, you will know how divided and exclusionary the reality is. But the author said that the connection between people can be achieved in many ways, and uniting the masses with emotions like populism is one of the ways; similarly, returning to the community and starting to cultivate people&#39;s sense of belonging in the community can also be used to unite the people with emotions. People unite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second way to save democracy is to Overcome Neoliberal Bias against the Public Good. Under marketism, public expenditures have been continuously reduced in recent decades. When the world is at peace, the world is at peace. But when a crisis occurs, public institutions can respond immediately to whatever extent they can withstand it, at the cost of countless lives. Adequate and effective public expenditure is also an important source of people&#39;s sense of belonging to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last two methods: Think Big and It Takes a Movement. Before establishing something, we must first break it. Since the democratic system is now outdated and ineffective, more powerful reforms are needed. After reading this, the biggest revelation for readers may not be that democracy can be saved, but that the problem of democratic decline is so serious that it is almost impossible to save, because all the methods mentioned by the author are far from reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to work needs, I recently stayed in Belgium and visited the European Parliament a few days ago. I talked about how the EU&#39;s democratic system is innovative, how to value the opinions of people of all countries, and how to embody the practice of democracy. But the reality is that Belgium is like other European and American cities: there are many homeless people on the streets, and there are people (and more than one) begging on every subway ride. I tried two rides back and forth on the same day, and I met the same person. A beggar is really destined, and I lament that my fate in Belgium actually fell on a beggar...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should I do? If you ignore various social problems, you will naturally not be able to gain the trust of the people. So is this book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; worthless and just to release emotions? Not really. Do you remember the key point mentioned at the beginning of the book? Democracy is a &quot;telic concept&quot;. The ultimate democracy is just a goal. The people can always look at the benchmark and run straight. Even if we can never reach the benchmark, we can still get closer to the benchmark. distance between. Human beings grow old, sick and die, and governments and regimes come and go. If we can walk in the direction of democracy and freedom and try our best to bring the goal closer instead of farther away, even if it is only a small amount, it is considered progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 12:25:19 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“脱钩是一种‘双输’战略”：专访奥地利前总理沃尔夫冈·许塞尔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261950]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 10:35:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;I need a cup of coffee.&quot; At noon on December 3, 2023, before the official interview began, Xussel Again, stress this to your assistant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From December 1st to 3rd, 78-year-old former Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel spent three busy days in Guangzhou. Opening speeches, media meetings, parallel forum speeches... his schedule is filled with &quot;brain activities&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is his first time to participate in the &quot;Understanding China&quot; international conference. &quot;This is an open discussion, very interesting and exciting.&quot; Xussel told Southern Weekend reporters, and &quot;people read and wrote &quot;Good speech&quot; is different. This is a conversation with controversy, &quot;both positive and negative, and people express their own opinions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are representatives from different countries here. Whether they are Europeans, Americans, or Chinese, everyone can participate. This makes it possible for people to reflect on their existing positions, understand new ideas, and gain enlightenment.&quot; Xu Sai I said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past 40 years, Xussel has visited China more than ten times and witnessed China&#39;s &quot;incredible development.&quot; Xussel is friendly to China and values ​​relations with China. During his term as prime minister from 2002 to 2007, the trade volume between China and Austria doubled several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, against the background of tense Sino-US relations, voices such as &quot;decoupling theory&quot; and &quot;deglobalization&quot; have become increasingly popular, casting a shadow on China-EU cooperation. Schüssel said he was &quot;totally opposed to decoupling&quot; because it was globalization and international trade that brought affluence and prosperity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Globalization is good for China, good for Europe, good for the United States, and good for those less developed countries. And decoupling is a &#39;lose-lose&#39; strategy.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;At noon on December 3, Wolfgang Schüssel accepted a face-to-face interview with Southern Weekend reporters.

(Photo/Southern Weekend reporter Lu Huiqian)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“China is a special model”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>; &lt;span>;What do you think is the difference between China&#39;s development model and that of the West? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China is certainly a special model. In the past, China did not have free movement, free enterprise, private ownership and private property, but today the situation is completely different and China is developing in a positive direction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This combination is very interesting. Usually we believe that market economy, free enterprise, private companies, etc., are complementary to freedom, openness, and pluralistic democracy. China, on the other hand, shows a different model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the Communist Party has a certain dynamic, an elitist management approach. They take the best and most talented people and then put those people to the test. If these people are successful, then they will be assigned to different positions again and then enter the next stage. This is a very interesting model. It&#39;s not our model, but it&#39;s a very effective model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;How does Europe view the rise of China? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Generally speaking, the European people respect China’s peaceful rise very much. I am an economist. I remember when Deng Xiaoping came to power, China&#39;s GDP was less than 200 billion US dollars. Today, that number is $7 trillion. This is incredible growth. China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and their living conditions have now greatly improved. The “One Belt, One Road” initiative proposed by China is also playing an important role. So I think China plays an important role on the international stage and has huge influence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have great respect and admiration for the Chinese model. Of course, we have different views on our respective political systems, that&#39;s for sure. But no matter what, every country has the right to choose its own future, and China does not belong to Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent times, Europe’s voice on China has not been positive. What is the reason behind this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, one million people have been killed or disabled in the past two years. Mostly young people. Every day, missiles and drones rain down on Ukraine, destroying infrastructure, homes, and apartments. Today, the area where the battle was fought looks like the moon, a no-man&#39;s land. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, I think both Europe and China should use their influence to stop this war and respect the sovereignty of independent countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Decoupling&quot; is a &quot;lose-lose&quot; strategy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What do you think? &quot;Decoupling theory&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am completely opposed to decoupling. it&#39;s out of the question. It is globalization and international trade that bring affluence and prosperity. According to customs figures, global trade has exploded over time. Globalization is good for China, good for Europe, good for the United States, and good for those less developed countries. So (decoupling) is absolutely impossible. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some research suggests that when decoupling actually occurs, it will cause a loss of more than 7% of global GDP. For countries that are more deeply integrated into global supply chains, decoupling will do more harm. Like China or Austria, Europe and the United States. Therefore, decoupling is really a “lose-lose” strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Are de-risking and decoupling the same? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;De-risking is different. I know some people suggest that these two statements are consistent, but in fact they are not the same. De-risking refers to the reluctance of people to rely heavily on a single partner. Take the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. Suddenly, we saw a shortage of medical equipment. Moreover, due to the trade blockade, all channels have been closed. We have no medicines from India and no masks from China. De-risking means you have to leave some protection areas in place to protect your people, just in case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As another example, in terms of energy, we cannot completely rely on Russia. We have to diversify our sources. If someone blew up the pipeline in Austria, or Ukraine or Russia stopped the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, everything would be ruined. No energy, no electricity, you can imagine what that means for the economy. So, you have to diversify. China is also de-risking. China needs to maintain sovereignty in data, supply chains, etc. This is completely understandable, and we will do the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is national defense. The Europeans have outsourced national defense to the Americans. Trump said that we will eventually leave NATO and Europe will be responsible for itself. This is what de-risking means. We have to invest more in our own defense because in a crisis you have to protect your own people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should you do if you suddenly encounter cyber hackers, surprise attacks, or blockades? What about your government, your site, your hospital, your energy company? Just like a company, we analyze potential risks in all directions of the company from a professional perspective - including paying attention to usage context, technical risks, external risks, market risks, etc. Every company will protect itself from risks, and the government must do the same . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent years, China has emphasized high-level opening up. What opportunities do you think this will bring? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think China’s opening up to the outside world is very important. Two factors struck me during the discussions at this conference. The first one is that a Chinese friend suggested that China is now focusing on developing a unified domestic market, such as managing the financial market, allocation, lending standards, etc. in all provinces with the same rules. This is exactly what the EU has always wanted to do but has not quite done yet. And once we complete that, it will be a huge catalyst for new growth. So, China is also following the same path. If China provides a large-scale market for its consumers and industrial partners, this is a major benefit for all of us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second point is that China is now committed to developing regional trade with ASEAN countries, which will also help Europe. Because I know that many companies in Europe are also interested in establishing ties with ASEAN countries. In many cases, people cannot accurately tell where a product comes from. For example, if you look at my smartphone, it contains 700-800 different components. They may be from Vietnam, Thailand, China, the United States, etc. As another example, my Audi car is made up of 900 different parts. It&#39;s assembled in Mexico, its engine comes from Slovakia, the gasoline comes from Hungary, parts come from China, and some elements come from Germany. So, this isn&#39;t just a &quot;German car&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I think this kind of inter-regional cooperation is beneficial. Moreover, cooperation enhances neighborly relations. For example, the EU intends to integrate the Western Balkan countries into the EU. Thirty years ago, a bloody war broke out in the Balkans. If Serbia develops cooperative trade with Croatia, Slovenia, etc., it will &quot;force&quot; peace. Therefore, I believe that inter-regional cooperation is conducive to prosperity, conducive to peace, and conducive to a harmonious future. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“In short, we need to cooperate”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2020, Austria’s first trip from The China-Europe train from Vienna to Xi&#39;an sets off. How do you evaluate the impact of China-Europe freight trains on Austria? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China-Europe freight trains are very important. Shipping containers by rail is much faster and more environmentally friendly than shipping by sea. Although shipping is cheap, it does have more negative impacts in terms of environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. So in my opinion, rail transportation is one of the elements of the future, which can both reduce costs and make cooperation more effective. Such an application has been very successful in Germany. If you look at the actual data, you will find that trade is growing positively, and it is not the so-called &quot;deglobalization&quot; or &quot;decoupling&quot; trend. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the changes in Sino-US relations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;First of all, 80% of the world’s population is neither Chinese nor American. Therefore, I think Sino-US cooperation is not the only cooperation that both sides need. I think we should really work on promoting cooperation between Europe and China. Currently, we are looking for and working hard to develop together. By the way, same interests as China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, a multipolar world requires well-functioning institutions, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. This is important, if something goes wrong, arbitration is always better than bilateral tensions and that is in our interest. First, it is important to resume military engagement because no one wants to cause an accident, but it can happen. Likewise, what we need is a multipolar world, not a bipolar world. This could be beneficial to all of us if there were some effectively functioning international institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few weeks ago, the heads of state of China and the United States met in San Francisco, and I felt very optimistic about it. This is a positive step towards cooperation. We should look forward to a positive and bright future, because the world needs such a future, and we are also facing common problems, such as climate change, financial problems, inflation, regional conflicts, etc. All in all, we need to work together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Do you think Austria or Europe will choose sides? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the bridge. I trust the leaders on both sides, they are rational politicians. I believe that good political initiatives always have the welfare of the people at heart. And the happiness of the people means prosperity, it means peace, it means employment, it means a good position when competing with other countries - of course in a peaceful and economic way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this conference, we honor Henry Kissinger. He is one of the architects of such a good policy. He was born in Germany and was deported. (He) came to the United States as a refugee from Nazi Germany but became a historian and an advocate for peaceful cooperation. Not confrontation, but working together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also recently commemorated the late Premier of China, Li Keqiang. He founded the Forum Connecting Europe and China about 10 years ago to develop innovative worldviews and explore overall solutions to related problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think they are our role models in how to deal with tough times. This is the challenge we see today, but we should not be pessimistic, we should make a positive future possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Zhang Xinyi also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 10:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[聚焦丨2023年“读懂中国”国际会议（广州）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261802]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 10:06:20&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;From December 1st to 3rd, the 2023 &quot;Understanding China&quot; International Conference (Guangzhou) was held at Yuexiu International Convention Center , hundreds of domestic and foreign guests from more than 30 countries and regions exchanged and discussed.

In 1955, he was invited by the French sinologist Bai Lege to assist in the &quot;Song History Research Project&quot; and write &quot;The Births, Deaths and Chronology of Figures in the Song Dynasty&quot;. Since then, he has served as professor in the Chinese Department of Ruhr University Bonn in Germany, the Department of Oriental Languages ​​at the University of Wisconsin in the United States, the Nanyang University in Singapore, and the History Department at Soochow University in Taiwan. Published include &quot;Chinese Science and Technology History Series&quot;, &quot;Yilin Congkao&quot;, &quot;Siku Synopsis Supplement&quot;, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng Tongwen is an internationally renowned scholar of Chinese literature and history. His academic fields include not only the traditional four-part study, but also social history, literary history, and cultural history. He is well known to the world for his outstanding achievements and widespread influence in many fields, such as history of art, history of science and technology. I entered school late, and due to the cross-strait barrier, I didn’t get to know him, which I regret very much. Recently, Taishun held a meeting to commemorate Mr. Weng to discuss Mr. Weng&#39;s achievements. After a brief review of Professor Wu Songdi&#39;s two huge volumes of works, I was impressed by his admiration. What is particularly admirable is that Mr. Weng cared about his hometown in his later years and donated a lot of money. Later scholars in the country did not forget his kindness. They published anthologies and commemorated discussions, which are enough to make good stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng and I have not had the opportunity to ask for advice in person, and there are few points of intersection in our academic fields. I feel that Mr. Weng Tongwen’s nostalgia for boxing and his academic merits , I am also grateful for Professor Wu Songdi’s enthusiastic invitation. The organizer of Taishun is motivated by the desire to advance cultivation and promote academics. However, I am sometimes troubled by trivial matters and am unable to advance. I would like to write down my rough experience after reading &quot;The Collected Works of Weng Tongwen&quot;. . A little bit of petal incense is used to pay homage to the former philosopher. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1. &quot;Supplement to the Siku Synopsis&quot;: traditional reading notes with high spirits&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Let me first talk about the philological research that I am more familiar with. , take the fifth volume of the anthology, &quot;Supplements to Siku Synopsis&quot; as an example. The eighty-eight articles in this part are written according to the traditional bibliographic and postscript method. Most of them are relatively simple and record the correction of errors found in &quot;Siku Synopsis&quot;. Some of them show the depth of effort. The first article examines the three volumes of Guo Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Peijin&quot; in the early Song Dynasty. It discusses the summary and quotes Zhongshu&#39;s biography from &quot;History of the Song Dynasty&quot;. It is believed that the summary quoted is very different from the popular Baiji version and the palace version &quot;History of the Song Dynasty&quot;. It is speculated that the two There was originally a rift in the shogunate of Liu Yun, Duke of Xiangyin, and the target was misunderstood. Then based on the surviving documents of the Five Dynasties and the early Song Dynasty, Guo Zhongshu&#39;s life was restored, Daduan was restored, and he criticized Zhongshu for being a &quot;drinker and irresponsible person who had many disobediences with others&quot;. He also revealed what Wang Guowei had studied and later engraved the &quot;Nine Classics Characters&quot;. It was written by Zhongshu, and his contribution is indescribable. Today, people have a lot to say about the eight volumes of the four-storey version of &quot;The Biography of Talented Scholars of the Tang Dynasty&quot; written by Xin Wenfang of the Yuan Dynasty. Weng Kao has a particularly valuable historical material, that is, it is revealed that the second volume of &quot;Shitian Collection&quot; written by Ma Zuchang of the Yuan Dynasty contains &quot;Ti Xinliang Shi &quot;Pisha Collection&quot;&quot;: &quot;If you can&#39;t sort through the sand, there will be too much gold. The meaning of modern and ancient times is short and short. Long song. Autumn plugs sing frost armor, spring houses cut paintings, chanting turns the remaining hair, desolate is Yin He.&quot; Mr. Weng therefore knew Xin You&#39;s &quot;Collection of Poems on Peeling Sand&quot;, and commented: &quot;Yin He, Yin Keng, He Xun is also . Compared with this, it is profound, and there is no doubt that he is as famous as Wang Zhiqian and others, and Yang Zai and others advocated peace with them.&quot; &quot;>;(&quot;Collected Works&quot; mislabeled this passage as Ma Zu Changyu)&lt;/span>; This is very important for understanding the poetry level and achievements of Xin Wenfang himself, who worked most diligently on the poets of the Tang Dynasty in the Yuan Dynasty. A study of Zhang Tangying&#39;s &quot;Shu 梼杌&quot; in the Song Dynasty shows that the original book must have been in ten volumes. The whole article is only over 200 words long and contains extremely rich information, so you can rely on it for basic judgments. There are five volumes of &quot;Luoyang Jialan Ji&quot;, and the biographical annotations are all mixed into the main text. Since the Qing Dynasty, many scholars have hoped to separate out the annotations as Quanzu Wangxiao&#39;s &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot; did. Tang Yan&#39;s &quot;Gou Shen&quot;, recent scholars Fan Xiangyong&#39;s &quot;College Notes&quot;, Zhou Zumo&#39;s &quot;College Notes&quot; and Xu Gaoruan&#39;s &quot;Republication&quot; believe that Xu Shu &quot;learned from various schools and came from behind&quot;, but did not add annotations to historical events. In this regard, it is known that Fan and Zhoujia have &quot;profound skills&quot; and the attached pictures are &quot;sufficient for reference.&quot; This has gone far beyond the revision and supplement of &quot;Siku Synopsis&quot;. In five or six hundred words, one can read the gains and losses of modern people&#39;s governance of &quot;Jialan Ji&quot;. Since the publication of the abstract, Yu Jiaxi&#39;s &quot;Diagnosis of Syndrome&quot; has been particularly famous, and his scholarship has paid special attention to the collected works of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, which can supplement the author&#39;s actions and the beginning and end of the original book. Mr. Weng Tongwen also paid attention to the historical events of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. He discussed various articles with Yu, such as the life story of Ye Zhi, the author of &quot;Ai Rizhai Congchao&quot;, and the article in &quot;Xijing Miscellaneous Notes&quot; quoted Lao Gan and Hong Ye, The remaining books are unknown. Wang Chen was the author of &quot;Tang Yulin&quot;. There are many inventions in the remaining books. Mr. Weng Tongwen even read Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Wang Danian&#39;s Lament&quot; written for Chen&#39;s father. He also knew that Chen came from a maternal relative&#39;s house and was a cousin to Shen. , Chen is older than Shen. There are so many wonderful things like this that it is impossible to list them all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73967&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70758&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/101090ef9a.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20231204163902.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;759&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/101090ef9a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260816&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;In 1936, Weng Tongwen (first from left) was with his family in Xi&#39;an. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. Research on Publishing History: China’s Contribution from a Western Academic Perspective&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Research on the History of Science, Technology and Culture&quot;, Part Three of &quot;Collected Works of Weng Tongwen&quot; &quot;, there are twenty-one surviving articles, one of which talks about silkworm breeding, eleven on the history of publishing, two on the custom of sitting on chairs, one on the history of gunpowder, one on the incorruptibility of Han corpses, and one on It talks about the observations of genetic phenomena by people in the Tang Dynasty, and the other four articles talk about social and cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries, covering a wide range of topics. The most direct impression is that Mr. Weng is a traditional scholar who has read many Chinese books in depth. However, because he has studied and taught in the West for a long time, his research interests and narrative stance are fundamentally different from those of traditional scholars. Whether he reads common books or Xi Jian&#39;s books all have unique insights and revelations, numerous discoveries, solid evidence, and new and reliable conclusions. These are the common characteristics of this group of papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Let’s talk about the history of publishing first. From writing to publishing, the Tang Dynasty was a critical period. Exactly when the earliest engravings began has been debated among bibliophiles. Due to the discovery of Dunhuang posthumous documents and new documents, the earliest publication was probably in Shuzhong during the Yizong period. As for the scriptures found in South Korea with Empress Wu&#39;s new characters, the exact date of publication is still controversial. The articles written by Mr. Weng Tongwen were written at different times, but they involve more detailed interpretations and discovery of documents. Here is a summary, which is very enlightening to read. &quot;Correct Interpretation of the Word &quot;Mule&quot; in Yuan Zhen&#39;s Writings Intertwined with the History of Printing&quot; is a large article that analyzes it from a small perspective. In December of the fourth year of Changqing reign of Yuanzhen, he wrote the &quot;Preface to the Collection of Baishi Changqing&quot;. There is a self-note: &quot;Yang and Yuejian wrote many calligraphy models of Le Tian and Yu&#39;s miscellaneous poems, which were sold in shops.&quot; Hu Zhenheng of the Ming Dynasty also wrote It is believed that &quot;Mule&quot; refers to engraving and printing. In modern times, Hu Shi advocated Youli, and then there were as many as 20 or 30 writers. Only three people such as Xiang Da expressed their opposition, thinking that &quot;Mule&quot; refers to double-line hooks to draw white. Reproduction technology of ink marks on poetry manuscripts. Mr. Weng agreed with Xiang and analyzed the interpretation and changes of the two words in the past dynasties from the etymology and word formation, hoping that future researchers will no longer be troubled by this word. His argumentation process was extremely rigorous, and he had two unexpected gains. First, he compared the word &quot;mo&quot; with the words &quot;mo&quot;, &quot;motuo&quot;, &quot;motuo&quot;, &quot;mole&quot;, and &quot;moji&quot; that have appeared successively since the Eastern Han Dynasty. They must all be the same. &quot;The technique of making copies on paper according to the original pattern of writing strokes or ink marks.&quot; The second is to prove that &quot;mule&quot; is a new term that appeared in the mid-Tang Dynasty. This argument may seem trivial, but it actually resolves the ambiguity in the interpretation of a large number of documents related to engraving issues in the Middle Ages, and the conclusion is fully credible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The earliest self-engraved poetry collection was Chen Yong, a native of Shu in the late Tang Dynasty&quot;. It is not long, but it is very interesting. &quot;Si Ku Yuan Jiu&quot; identifies the person who first engraved a collection of poems as Qian Shu Guanxiu, whose disciple Tanyu&#39;s &quot;Preface to the Collection of Chanyue&quot; says: &quot;Then I searched for and inspected the collection of poems and secretly memorized about a thousand poems, which were carved into a volume. The title is &quot;Collection of Chanyue.&quot; This preface was written in the fifth year of Qiande in the former Shu Dynasty &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(923)&lt;/span>;, and it is clear that there is no Disagreement. Ye Dehui&#39;s &quot;Shu Lin Qing Hua&quot; according to the &quot;Old History of the Five Dynasties - He Ning Biography&quot; states that &quot;there are hundreds of volumes collected, self-sealed on the board, hundreds of seals printed, and benefits distributed to others&quot;, which lists his events before Guanxiu. Mr. Weng believes that He Ning is later than Guan Xiu, and there is no absolute date for the engraving of his books, so he disagrees. He uncovered a neglected record from &quot;Beimeng Suoyan&quot;, that is, Chen Yong, a Jinshi during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong, had a pair of lines at the beginning of his poem: &quot;Buffaloes on the other side cross with their noses floating on their noses, and sandbirds nod their way along the stream.&quot; Taoist priest Du Guangting Questioned, these two sentences are not good, &quot;Why should this be the beginning of the volume?&quot; Chen Yong replied: &quot;It was once rewarded by the nobles, so it is engraved on the beginning of the volume.&quot; Mr. Weng revealed this article, which is of course very valuable and should be able to supplement the previous ones. A case study of Shu engraved poetry collection. Whether the absolute date is earlier than Guanxiu can be discussed again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The earliest publisher in world history appeared in Chang&#39;an in the middle and late Tang Dynasty&quot;, first based on Dunhuang documents, it was confirmed that there was a person selling almanacs in the second year of Emperor Xizong&#39;s reign in the late Tang Dynasty. The Fan Shang family in Chengdu and the Bian family in Longchifang, Chengdu County, which sold Buddhist mantras, are all mentioned in the discussions of Zhang Xiumin, Li Shuhua, and Qian Cunxun. Chen Zuolong, a bookseller in Chang&#39;an, has passed the examination of two calligraphers surnamed Li. Mr. Weng even cited the example of Bo 2633&#39;s &quot;Mrs. Cui&#39;s Training of Women&quot;, although it was a banknote version, but there was no &quot;printed version of the Li family in Shangdu&quot; at the end, so it was written based on the printed version. I have read this volume again and again. The so-called &quot;Praise to Bai Shilang&quot; is definitely named after Bai Juyi, and the work may not have been published during Bai Juyi&#39;s lifetime. The second is Bo&#39;s 2675 reverse note of &quot;New Collection of Emergency Moxibustion Sutra&quot;, which has the characters &quot;Seal of the Li family in Beijing in Dongshi&quot; at the end. Although it can be inferred to be after the second year of Xiantong, it is also very precious. The third one is a printed copy of the Si 8010 residual calendar, with the cross &quot;Shangdu Shi Dongshi Dadaojia seal&quot; at the end, which is considered to belong to a bookstore or publisher with &quot;Da Dao&quot; as its inscription. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the two articles about movable type printing, in addition to researching Bi Sheng&#39;s invention of clay movable type printing stated in Shen Kuo&#39;s &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot;, Mr. Weng vigorously pursued Bi Sheng His real life and what inspired his clay movable type skills. Particularly exciting among them are &quot;the doubts caused by clay type and its efficiency issues&quot; and &quot;the reason why movable type could not replace engraving before the late Qing Dynasty&quot;. The former, based on bits and pieces of records, shows that Bi Sheng had several projects in succession in the two hundred years after Bi Sheng. Several attempts were made, but there was no big development. Mr. Weng’s explanation for this is that although Bi Sheng was the first to invent movable type, there was no inheritance of linearity in the future. Instead, everyone kept starting from scratch and never overcame the shortcomings of the crude and rough movable type. Although China invented movable type printing, it did not replace woodblock printing. Fundamental changes did not occur until Western technology was introduced. &quot;Supplementary Discussion on the Invention of European Movable Type Plate Also Induced by Engraving Printing&quot; examines the way Europeans experimented with printing techniques before Gutenberg in Germany promoted the principle of movable type in the 15th century. In particular, he saw that the high frequency of letter engraving made it easier for Westerners to get ideas. Chinese woodblock printing methods inspired Europeans even more prominently. Although there are many speculations in this article, the basic insights are still within a reasonable range, and what I see is quite reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, the study of the life and book engraving career of Chen Qi, a descendant of Wu Zhao from the Later Shu Dynasty, the Xiangtai Yue family of the Southern Song Dynasty, and the book printer, are also included. They are all important and key figures in the history of Chinese printing. It is interesting to read clearly. &quot;Printing reduces the cost of books by nine-tenths&quot; is also an interesting topic. What I am more interested in is the interesting story at the end of the article about the fairy Wu Cailuan&#39;s book &quot;Tang Yun&quot;. Mr. Weng continued the opinion of Taiwanese scholar Wang Meng&#39;ou and believed that Wu Cailuan&#39;s &quot;Tang Yun&quot; was hidden in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. He always regretted not being able to see it in person. According to Zhou Zumo&#39;s &quot;Collection of Yun Shu of the Tang and Five Dynasties&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Zhonghua Book Company)&lt;/span>;, this volume is stored in the Palace Museum in Beijing and was photocopied by Zhou After reading the complete version, it was concluded that it was the Tang Dynasty Pei Wuqi&#39;s orthographic version of &quot;Public Mistakes, Filling the Gap and Qie Yun&quot;, not Sun Wei&#39;s &quot;Tang Yun&quot;. As for the book written by the female fairy Wu Cailuan, it is only a beautiful legend caused by the inscription and postscript of Xiang Yuanbian of the Ming Dynasty, and cannot be taken as true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73968&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70759&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/61524c0624.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20231204164056.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;714&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/61524c0624.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260817&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;In the 1950s, Weng Tongwen (first from right) was in France with his friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. Science and Technology Life History Research: Daily and Important Perspectives&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Regarding life history, Mr. Weng Tongwen talks about the origin of chairs in China These two magnificent articles are examined in the context of global human history. They not only draw on the insights of Chinese and foreign scholars, but also extensively quote rich material objects obtained from literature and archaeology, and strive to restore the Chinese people from sitting low or kneeling to gradually sitting high. The process, including the &quot;Chronological Record of Rope Bed Materials&quot;, covers a period of more than 700 years. It mentions six chairs that appeared east of Congling from the Jin Dynasty to the end of the Six Dynasties. Five of them originated from India, which further proves that the chairs were introduced from India via the Silk Road. He also came to the same conclusion when he investigated the special-shaped rope beds of chairs, and proved that most of them were related to monks and monasteries. He pointed out that the rope bed was a tool for monks to meditate and meditate, and some monks developed the habit of not lying down day and night throughout their lives, and most of them He sat on the rope bed. After the Middle Tang Dynasty, he examined the traces of chairs entering the palace and scholar&#39;s homes, and explained that chairs also led to an increase in the height of other furniture, such as tables, tall cabinets, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng talked about the era when the book &quot;The Synopsis of Zhenyuan Miaodao&quot; was written. Based on the mention of Yanluozi in the book, it is suspected that it was written in the middle and late Five Dynasties. . I quoted the general rules of Taoist discussion from Taoist books, and felt that it was more likely to be written in the Song Dynasty. Based on the experience of the Waidan family, the article believes that incendiary gunpowder weapons began in the Song Dynasty, and the emergence of firecrackers should be after Song Renzong. The general conclusion can be believed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Three Interlocking Inventions Traced to Silk Production Techniques&quot; is the first and most important article in this part, so I I’ll introduce it at the end. China is a large agricultural country, and there has been a tradition of men farming and women weaving since ancient times. This article will explain that China&#39;s three great inventions (referring to printing, gunpowder, magnets) or four great inventions (the first three plus papermaking) have certain logic in themselves. His opinion is: 1. The discovery of the use of silk The invention of techniques for breeding silkworms to produce silk and bleaching wadding; 2. Papermaking originated from the imitation of &quot;natural paper&quot; appearing in bleached wadding; 3. Block printing originated from the combination of &quot;printable paper&quot; and &quot;plate lettering&quot;; 4. Movable type printing technology was conceived due to the &quot;phenomenon of discarding undamaged carved boards&quot;. Although this does not include all the four great inventions, it well explains the intrinsic reason why only China can pioneer the invention of papermaking and printing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73966&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70757&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/9bc7149361.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20231204162745.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1504&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9bc7149361.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260818&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;&quot;Collected Works of Weng Tongwen&quot;, Zhejiang People&#39;s Publishing House, 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;4. Standing between tradition and modernity, showing the path for future generations to learn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Weng Tongwen as the representative Make a brief summary of the academic achievements and characteristics of the older generation of scholars. Mr. Weng Tongwen is a generation of scholars born in the early Republic of China, and his research path continued until the end of the twentieth century. When he was born, the Qing Dynasty was already dead, but he was proficient in the four classics, based on the Classics, and enriched with poetry. He took notes because of his gains in reading, and concentrated on writing papers based on his experiences. This is a traditional academic method. There are still lingering thoughts. However, the trend since the early Republic of China has strongly advocated using Western learning to explore the path of national salvation and development, and has also led humanities scholars to strive to accept Western academic approaches and explore various new academic topics related to life and society that the sages often ignored. Mr. Weng Tongwen was initially educated at Southwest Associated University, Yunnan University and St. John&#39;s University. He studied and worked in Britain, France, Germany, the United States, New Zealand and other countries, and finally served in universities in Taiwan. His scholarship is rooted in tradition, and his vision and methods are deeply influenced by Western learning. He highly integrates documents and cultural relics, fully integrates society and life, and pays special attention to the lower society, special skills, and basic classics. As mentioned above in this article, there are less than a hundred articles in the &quot;Sikubiaoyao Supplement&quot;. The long ones are more than a thousand words, and the short ones are only a hundred words. However, what they say must contain new insights and maintain a high spirit. It is a reference to the sayings of many famous writers in modern times. , all with outspoken comments. Articles on the history of life, science and technology, and publishing history can also exhaust the literature, refer to the sages of the times, analyze the subtle ideas, invent new insights, cite abundantly, be cautious in speaking, have clear opinions, and write well. Being peaceful can fully reflect everyone&#39;s style and can show the path for future generations to follow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[感冒发烧了，到底感染了啥？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261944]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 08:01:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/12/06/d8d9dbf252.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2860&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/ 06/d8d9dbf252.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260833&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[五月天被质疑假唱]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261928]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 23:10:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Recently, Mayday was questioned for lip-synching at the concert.

His name is Zhang Longji, born in Jingning County in 1979, with a university education. According to the announcement of the Pingliang Intermediate Court, from 2010 to June 2019, when he served as the teaching director, principal and teacher of a primary school in Jingning County, he used corporal punishment and other means to form a mental coercion on primary school students who lacked sexual defense ability. He used explanation exercises, When students handed in homework and other opportunities, they repeatedly raped 5 young girls aged 8 to 12 years old in their dormitories, and repeatedly raped 17 girls aged 8 to 14 years old in public in the classroom or in their dormitories. Child molestation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Perhaps to protect the privacy of the victim, the court did not disclose the name of the elementary school where Zhang Longji taught. Southern Weekend reporters learned that the primary school where the incident occurred was the village primary school in the aforementioned village and had been withdrawn and merged in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When the news that &quot;a primary school principal raped and molested 22 girls in 9 years&quot; caused an uproar on the Internet, this village in the eye of the storm seemed particularly silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A small village in the mountains&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Especially in our village, don&#39;t ask about these things.&quot; Upon hearing Zhang Longji&#39;s name, villager Zhang Bi Peng&#39;s tone became stern. On November 16, 2023, he stood at the gate of the hospital and waved his hands to the Southern Weekend reporter as if to drive him away. &quot;It&#39;s all my sad past.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Bipeng’s yard is only a few hundred meters away from the original site of the primary school where the incident occurred. Only the couple lives at home, and his father, Zhang Pinghe, takes care of his grandson in Jingning County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Pinghe is the old principal of the primary school where the incident occurred. He has taught in the village for more than 40 years and has now retired. On social platforms, he is called &quot;Perseverance in the Mountains.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, the empty and abandoned school building remains at the north end of the village. The gate is locked from the outside and cannot be entered. The outside of the courtyard is filled with corn stalks as high as the wall. Compared with the picture that appeared in the news ten years ago, the red roof of the elementary school bungalow still looks the same, and the exterior wall has turned white, as if it had been painted and repaired in the last few years, and the windows and doors are sealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The yard next to the school is still open. There are only two old houses. One is piled with props for celebrating the New Year and the lion dance. The other has several An old, dusty wooden table with medals hanging on the wall. Among the dead branches and weeds, there are two green basketball hoops. A villager said that this area is the school playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The villager introduced that the primary school was merged in 2019, and then the children in the village went to the central primary school in the town. It was the first boarding school in the town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the merger, this rural primary school was once a model in Jingning County. Among more than a dozen schools in the township, it ranked among the top three in performance every year. There are not many people in the school. When Sun Chuning, a staff member of the Jingning County Education Bureau, visited in 2015, there were only 29 students and 5 teachers in the school. Many students go to towns or counties with their migrant parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2015, Zhang Pinghe was still the principal, one or two years away from retirement. Sun Chuning had a good impression of the old principal, &quot;Teacher Zhang has been taking care of the school for decades, both during winter and summer vacations.&quot; He said he did not know Zhang Longji and did not pay attention to his situation when he visited the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The old principal has been commended repeatedly. According to public reports, he once took teachers to quarry clay to paint classrooms, went to a forest farm to collect waste materials to make simple tables and stools, and stayed at the school building to dig canals to divert water during heavy rains. Some netizens said in the comment area that in their memory, even the wife of the old principal pulled a trolley and worked in the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A Pingliang photographer once shot a short film for the old principal when he was about to retire. He said that the photo was taken for &quot;awards and competitions&quot;. At the end of the film, the words &quot;Produced by Jingning County Education Bureau&quot; appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, Zhou Lan, a school-age student who lived in a nearby village, came to this primary school to study. The school&#39;s reputation is one of the reasons why parents choose the school, but more importantly, it is almost his &quot;only solution&quot; for transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The surrounding area is inconvenient and there is no public transportation. Students measure distance by round-trip walking time, and anything that can be reached by walking in 30 minutes is considered &quot;very close.&quot; The map shows that Zhou Lan has to walk about 7 kilometers to the central primary school in the town, which takes an hour and a half on foot. At that time, &quot;there was an age requirement for living in school there, and you had to be in fifth grade or fourth grade.&quot; So Zhou Lan could only attend this village primary school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The grandchildren of the old principal did not study in this village primary school, but were sent to the county town and are now studying in high school. Zhang Bipeng explained that it was because “the conditions in the county are good.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The number of teachers and students in rural primary schools is constantly decreasing. At its peak, the school had more than 200 students. A few years before Zhou Lan enrolled, there were more than 100 people in the school. “There were quite a lot of people at that time, but they all left in the end.” In a school evaluation and acceptance self-inspection report filled out by Zhang Pinghe in 2016, the school had only 21 students and 4 faculty members, divided into 4 teaching classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The report states that the primary school was founded in 1957. It was expanded into a standardized primary school on the original site in 2002 and changed to a six-year complete primary school in 2003. The old principal wrote this paragraph in the report: The school carefully organizes teachers and students to study education laws and regulations, teachers&#39; law, and the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Minors. All teachers and students in the school know, understand and abide by the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Longji is one of the above-mentioned teachers. A relevant roster of Jingning County in 2014 shows that Zhang Longji was a professional technical level 12 and a primary school teacher level 2 at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Zhang Longji took over as the principal of this village primary school. The transfer of teachers in rural schools is the responsibility of the local education bureau. The principal of a rural primary school in Gansu said that the position of principal must go through layers of selection before being qualified, including examinations and background training. “Each unit has to go through it again. For example, if there is a problem with your credit card, you will not be allowed to pass. , particularly strict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the court notice, Zhang Longji had been committing crimes for several years at this time. Why didn’t Zhang Longji’s actions attract attention during this period? As of press time, Zhang Pinghe had not responded to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Jingning County Education Bureau stated that the relevant details involve the protection of minors, so it is inconvenient to disclose them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I didn’t understand it at that time, so I saw it as a joke”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Zhou Lan was studying in this village primary school, he saw Zhang Longji with his own eyes He molested students in the classroom, but felt he had no choice but to do anything about it because &quot;he is the principal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the school was annexed and the school building was locked, Zhou Lan and several male classmates secretly climbed over the wall and entered. He said that Zhang Longji had two dormitories at the school, one of which belonged to his wife. The couple has two girls and one boy, and their three children sometimes come to live in the dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Lan said that he and his classmates tore off the seal on the dormitory door and held a &quot;special ceremony&quot; inside. According to the video sent by Zhou Lan, they placed a photo on a low table, placed three small trays in front of the photo, placed chocolate pie on it, and burned paper on the side. Before Zhang Longji&#39;s execution, this &quot;ceremony&quot; with the meaning of memorial was a kind of revenge. They have been held three times in total, the last time in October 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Lan hated this teacher in her heart. He said that Zhang Longji often corporally punished and beat students, and he was very cruel. &quot;He took a stick and hit me on the head, (beating) to death, which cast a shadow on me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They are the last batch of students Zhang Longji taught and are now in junior high school. Zhou Lan recalled that before the incident in 2019, there were only three girls left in the school, and some had transferred away before. Zhang Longji would molest girls in front of him. When correcting homework in class, he would also call girls to the podium and molest them in public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also heard from girls in the school that Zhang Longji would call them to the dormitory. When school was over in the evening, Zhang Longji would use excuses such as &quot;the homework was not finished&quot; to prevent female students from going home and keep them until after nine o&#39;clock in the evening. He said that he was still young at the time and had little idea of ​​what Zhang Longji did. He only thought it was strange and did not tell his parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What Zhou Lan saw was just the tip of the iceberg. During an interview with Southern Weekend reporters, we learned that the incident of being molested by Zhang Longji was probably earlier than the time mentioned in the court notice and had occurred since his early years of teaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From 2004 to 2005, Lulu was in the first grade of a primary school in the town, and Zhang Longji, who was about 25 years old at the time, was her math teacher. She recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at that time the school was a bungalow and it was very cold in winter, so they used stoves to burn charcoal for heating. During math class, Zhang Longji would call a female student to the podium, hold her in his arms, and &quot;do some very intimate gestures&quot; in front of thirty or forty students in the class, in the name of checking her homework. She said that she had personally seen several girls in the class being hugged, and &quot;he would pick some of the prettier little girls.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lulu herself is also a victim. Zhang Longji held her in his arms and breathed into her, &quot;I felt very strange, so I hid.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;By 2009, Professor Zhang Longji’s subject changed from mathematics to English. That year, Zhang Lei, a male student, was in the third grade. During class, Zhang Longji held the girl in his arms and taught her vocabulary, touched her face, and behaved affectionately. He saw a female classmate sitting on Zhang Longji&#39;s lap with a look of disgust on her face. Forced by the teacher&#39;s authority, she did not dare to make any big moves to resist. She could only twist her body to avoid his physical contact, but it did not have much effect. “I didn’t understand it at that time, so I just took it as a joke.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the same year, during a break in class, fifth-grade Lin Ling said that she was lying on her back in class. When she was sleeping on the table, there were many students in the classroom, and Zhang Longji suddenly hugged her from behind. Lin Ling was frightened and quickly said, &quot;Hurry up and let me go.&quot; He let go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the accounts of former students, Zhang Longji’s obscene behavior lasted for a long time, and students of different grades were victimized. &quot;He should have been molesting girls since he first joined the workforce... My last class, my current class, my next class, including my sister&#39;s class all know about it.&quot; November 2023 , Lin Ling told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Ling said that female students did not dare to get along with Zhang Longji and were afraid of being hugged by him. They felt &quot;especially annoying&quot; and privately complained to each other &quot;Why is he That’s it again”. &quot;But we didn&#39;t even realize at the time that he was breaking the law.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ignored help&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first female students Zhang Longji molested Tried to save myself. Lulu, who was 7 years old at the time, told her mother about this &quot;strange thing&quot;. Her mother didn&#39;t take it seriously and just thought it was an elder&#39;s love for children. &quot;She said that your math teacher thinks you are very good and feels sorry for you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the parent-teacher conference, Zhang Longji would face Lulu’s mother Praise her and say that the little girl is &quot;very smart and well-behaved&quot;. Lulu analyzed that this strengthened her mother&#39;s judgment and made her feel that the young mathematics teacher was very responsible and appreciated her daughter, without any warning. Looking back, Lulu feels that rural parents “are very lacking in awareness in this regard.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Ling agreed with this analysis. She euphemistically said that the adults in the village are relatively simple, traditional and conservative. Lin Ling, who was 12 years old at the time, told her mother that there was a teacher in school who always hugged female classmates during class and also hugged herself, but the answer she received was unexpected. &quot;My mother said that my thoughts were not sincere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Talking about the memory of asking her parents for help in fifth grade to no avail, the adult Lin Ling hesitated for a few seconds. ,Sighed. &quot;Maybe he has a better personality, but the adults don&#39;t believe it.&quot; She told her mother two or three times, but when she saw her mother&#39;s reaction, she stopped mentioning it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In front of children and adults, Zhang Longji has two different faces. When facing students, he sometimes kissed and hugged them, and sometimes violently punished them. But when facing adults, in Lulu&#39;s words, he behaved politely and responsibly, &quot;it&#39;s quite invisible.&quot; His WeChat avatar is an ID photo with a red background, a Chinese character face, single eyelids, a wide nose, a smile, wearing a black suit and a red polka dot tie, and his hair is meticulously combed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where Zhang Longji grew up, the villagers also had a good impression of him. Compared with the remote teaching villages, Xiaohe Village in Gangou Town, where Zhang Longji&#39;s home is located, is closer to Jingning County and has convenient transportation. In the eyes of the villagers, Zhang Longji is one of the few &quot;top students&quot; who has gone to university, with high academic qualifications and decent work. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A villager said that Zhang Longji and his two sisters were both college students. After graduation, they earned money and renovated old houses in the village. A building was bought in the county seat. Zhang Longji&#39;s wife is a teacher. &quot;His wife is teaching. She is slim (dialect means thin) and her family is in good condition.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Now the Zhang family&#39;s house is vacant, the iron door is rusty and locked, unused bricks are piled in the inner courtyard, and the red paper on the porch has faded. The courtyard is scattered with yellow leaves floating off the branches. The above-mentioned villagers said with some sadness that Zhang Longji&#39;s family was poor when he was a child. The shoes his mother wore were made of rags without uppers. His father sold rapeseed and raised three college students with hard work. They never thought that he would go down the wrong path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73929&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70720&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/b9dc7b55d7.jpeg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG3262.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The old house of Zhang Longji&#39;s family in Xiaohe Village, Jingning County, Pingliang City, Gansu Province.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The last time the villagers saw Zhang Longji was in 2019. Some villagers remember that in April of that year, an old man died in the village, and Zhang Longji returned to the village to &quot;carry and bury the person.&quot; He was in &quot;good condition&quot; at the time, but he did not expect that the crime of rape and molestation was about to be exposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More than a month later, Zhang Longji was taken away by the police during the Dragon Boat Festival after a victim&#39;s family called the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Longji still has relatives who run a supermarket in Xiaohe Village. He said that Zhang Longji rarely returned to the village after settling in the county, and there was not much contact between the two parties. &quot;After the old man (Zhang Longji&#39;s parents) disappeared, he would not come back for a year or two. When he came back, he would have a quick meeting and we would not chat.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;He refused to recall when he learned that Zhang Longji molested students. &quot;These things have happened, and now everyone here knows that there is such a person. There are some things that we can&#39;t talk about in depth, can&#39;t say, and don&#39;t want to say.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; A 64-year-old villager still has a good impression of Zhang Longji, thinking that he is a decent person and behaves &quot;stablely.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He may have never seen Zhang Longji&#39;s ruthless side. According to the students&#39; accounts, both boys and girls were beaten by Zhang Longji, and iron rods, steel bars, and mops were all &quot;weapons.&quot; A boy recalled that when he was 9 years old and in third grade, he was beaten so hard that he &quot;couldn&#39;t sit still for a month, and his buttocks were all black.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Violence makes seeking help more difficult. Lin Ling remembers that when he was in first grade, Zhang Longji kicked a boy from the front of the podium to the back of the classroom. &quot;No one dared to resist, really. Because he beat people so fiercely, we didn&#39;t dare to say anything.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I never mentioned the past injuries again&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The most difficult time for Lin Ling to let go was watching her friend being hurt by Zhang Longji. One day when she was in the fourth or fifth grade, during extracurricular activities, she and her friends went to Zhang Longji&#39;s dormitory to hand in homework. Zhang just came back from playing ball and was naked in the dormitory, wearing only shorts. &quot;When we handed in our homework, he hugged my classmate and kissed him hard there. It scared me. I ran away quickly.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;There were no other teachers around at that time. Lin Ling ran out and told another classmate what happened. The two comforted each other and said, &quot;It should be fine.&quot; About 10 minutes later, the classmate who was hugged came out of Zhang Longji&#39;s dormitory. Lin Ling asked about her situation, and the reply she received was &quot;nothing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I was very worried about that classmate of mine, but when we were young, we didn&#39;t dare to say anything.&quot; Lin Ling recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;That memory became the shadow of her childhood. She always remembered that the female classmate who was being hugged was trying to resist and try to break free, but she was only a primary school student, thin and not very strong. Zhang Longji kept holding her and kissed her on the mouth. It was only after Lin Ling grew up that she realized, &quot;Every time we hand in homework or do anything else, we have to go to his separate dormitory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Things are buried deep in the hearts of the two girls. &quot;I know (that incident did) a lot of harm to my classmate, but until now I haven&#39;t dared to ask her. She is now married, and the matter has never been mentioned again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For twenty years, most of the victims licked their wounds silently. After the news that &quot;a primary school principal raped and molested 22 girls in 9 years&quot; attracted attention, some people worried on social platforms: What will happen to the children who have been harmed? They still have a long way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Xuemei, the initiator of &quot;Girls Protection&quot; and deputy editor-in-chief of ifeng.com, told Southern Weekend reporters that after being sexually assaulted, children&#39;s psychology will change, even in the long term. Troubled, I hope that with the help of the local Women&#39;s Federation and other departments, the children can receive timely psychological intervention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She specifically reminded parents not to beat, scold or blame their children. &quot;This is not the child&#39;s fault. We need to make the child feel that the family is safe and that parents can accept talking and relying on them. If after such an incident, parents beat, scold and blame them, they will push the child into a more helpless situation. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Girls Protection&quot; project team has been to many rural schools across the country to conduct sexual assault prevention courses. Sun Xuemei found that the common problem currently is the lack of sex education, and many people talk about sexual perversion. However, it can be seen from the gradually increasing reporting rate that people&#39;s awareness is improving. &quot;Only when everyone&#39;s awareness increases and they pay attention to this problem, and (the problem) is exposed more and more, will it be solved faster.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The end of Zhang Longji’s criminal behavior was due to the call to the police by the victim’s family in June 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Lan recalled that at noon on the day of the incident, Zhang Longji drove away from school. Also disappearing was a female classmate from the school. &quot;After class, (I) saw that the girl was not there, so I told other teachers. I didn&#39;t know that until the next day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He heard from the girl’s sister that the girl tried her best to resist and was beaten with a heavy object by Zhang Longji and was seriously injured. The girl was sent to Jingning County Hospital, but her injuries were serious and she was sent to Lanzhou for medical treatment. Zhang Longji was later taken away by the police in Lanzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In November 2019, 30-year-old Yu Tong met Zhang Longji in the detention center, and the two stayed in the same cell for three months. After completing his sentence in 2023, he provided his release certificate to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the prison cell, Zhang Longji wore a red vest, handcuffs and shackles. Yu Tong said that &quot;inmates&quot; all knew that he was suspected of rape and child molestation. During that period, Zhang Longji was often bullied by his fellow prisoners and had to be moved from one cell to another. Another &quot;inmate&quot; Zhao Wuping also confirmed that &quot;people like him are often bullied in there.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Wuping entered the detention center for drunk driving in July 2019. He was &quot;headache&quot; about his situation and did not want to chat with other people. But he remembered that Zhang Longji&#39;s condition at the time was &quot;not bad&quot; and he said, &quot;He will be released after being sentenced to more than ten years.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The seriousness of the matter obviously exceeded Zhang Longji&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Pingliang Intermediate Court sentenced Zhang Longji to death for rape and deprivation of political rights for life; for child molestation, he was sentenced to ten years in prison; several crimes were punished concurrently. ,Decided to implement the death penalty, deprivation of political rights for life. Zhang Longji once appealed, but the appeal was rejected by the Gansu Provincial High Court and the original death sentence was upheld, which was approved by the Supreme People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 7, 2023, the Pingliang Intermediate People’s Court followed the execution order issued by the President of the Supreme People’s Court, verified Zhang Longji’s identity, and escorted him to the execution ground.

The article states that the student threatened the whole class during the test paper during the test period. She cried and made the teacher&#39;s thighs, and gave the teacher kneeling and praying that the test results should not tell their parents. After being rejected, they threatened to abuse the teacher. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Parents are collectively protested and picked up their children in advance to start strikes. On November 29, the local education bureau issued a notice saying that the primary school was transferred to the parents of the students in the class, and the parents of the students were resolved in the class. Changtu County Education Bureau and Experimental Primary School ... After research and decision, the transfer plan was canceled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What do you think of this incident? First of all, it is necessary to discuss the nature of the student&#39;s problem. If the above -mentioned parents are true, then the life threatens the whole class for a while, and pray for the teacher for a while, and then threatens to abuse the teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the position of the 8th parents of the 8th class is not difficult to understand: the original class order and discipline are good. Suddenly a &quot;troublemaker&quot; and &quot;irritation of the wrong&quot;, so that other children can not be peaceful, affect learning No one will welcome progress, tension, or even disturbing children&#39;s mood. If you can&#39;t get it out of the door before you come, please go after you come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Because a student in a class has a behavioral problem or character problem, interfere with the order order or bullying other students; As a result, other parents were unbearable, and they &quot;strikes&quot;, went to the Education Bureau to petition, and went online to control complaints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, the fifth grade parents of Hangzhou Wenlan Experimental School sent an open letter online that the classmates of the surname W were a child who was too protected by the parents and had a dispute with teachers and classmates in the school. Impact schools, impacting classrooms have repeatedly threatened, scolded related children, parents, and even teachers in extreme ways. For this reason, parents were angry. The school issued a notice that &quot;the incident of multiple students who had not taken off in the school in the 505 class of our school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Secondly, the school and the local education bureau&#39;s handling of such incidents is nothing more than trying to reconcile and persuade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Changtu County Experimental Primary School abandoned the transfer plan, saying that &quot;it will further optimize educational resources, reasonably allocate teachers, and teach students to teach students.&quot; The implication of the problem, the students of the problem continue to stay in Class 11, but it seems that the more resistant and more ways to resist. &quot;At present, students have returned to school fully.&quot; The problem is temporarily resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The strike of the Hangzhou Wenlan Experimental School was established at that time, a joint class composed of the District Education Bureau and the District Public Security Branch, and then a parent interview, &quot;seriously listening to the situation and appeal of the parents&#39; situation&quot;, &quot;The two sides actively communicate, eliminate differences, and discuss the consensus before discussing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Why are similar treatment methods so common? This is because the current compulsory education law stipulates that students who violate the school management system shall criticize and educate them and not be expelled (Article 27). Under such constraints, a &quot;problem child&quot; that many parents think of unbearable can only be tolerated at the beginning of a class. Let the &quot;problem child&quot; transfer to school; if you can&#39;t get rid of it, parents with the door will consider transferring to their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, some people say on the Internet, and the volume is not small: let the &quot;problem child&quot; be transferred to a specialized school to accept correction? This question is simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Indeed, Article 6 of the Minor Crime Law stipulates that the state has strengthened the construction of specialized schools and specially educated minors with serious bad behaviors. So, how about serious bad behavior? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The bad behavior defined by the law refers to &quot;acts that are not conducive to their healthy growth&quot; by minors, such as multiple absenteeism and escape; Gangs participating in the implementation of bad behaviors and so on. Obviously, if bad behavior is just harmful to yourself, many of the key behaviors are negative, which will endanger other children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Article 31 of the Law stipulates that the school should strengthen management and education for minor students with bad behaviors and not discriminate; if they refuse to correct correction or the circumstances are serious, the school can be punished according to the situation or adopts the following. Management and educational measures: training; requiring to obey specific behavioral specifications; requiring to participate in specific special education; requiring to participate in service activities in school; psychological counseling and behavioral intervention of social workers or other professionals. But obviously does not include firing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The so -called severe bad behavior refers to &quot;the criminal law implemented by minors, the behavior of not criminal punishment due to the dissatisfaction of the legal criminal responsibility age, and the serious harm of society&quot; , Intercept others, forced to use hard or arbitrarily damaged, occupying public and private property, etc., and other provocations; beating, abused, intimidating, or intentionally hurting others&#39; bodies. So can you be sent to a special school immediately with such behavior? Neither. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Article 41 of the Law stipulates that for minors with serious bad behaviors, the public security organs can take the following correction education measures according to the specific situation: to teach; order to apologize and compensate for losses; ; Order to report regularly; order to obey specific behavioral specifications, shall not implement specific behaviors, contact specific personnel, or enter specific places; order psychological counseling, behavior correction; or order to participate in social service activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Minors implement serious harm of social behavior, harsh circumstances or serious consequences, or have repeatedly implemented a serious harmful social behavior, or refuse to accept or cooperate with the above 41 correction education measures, After the evaluation and approval of the Special Education Guidance Committee, the education administrative department and the public security organs may decide to send it to specialized schools for special education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It can be seen that students just disrupt classroom discipline and bully other students, which is not a &quot;serious bad behavior&quot;. It is impossible to get fired. It is impossible to go to a specialized school. External nature makes other children, teachers, and parents suffering. In the above -mentioned framework, the problem is difficult to solve, and I am afraid it will happen from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style = &quot;color: orange&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx. run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[持有不超十天、覆盖数千只股票、年换手率百倍中国量化投资的股市“淘金术”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261894]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-05 21:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; In the second half of 2023, as the A shares fluctuate intensify, it approached 3000 points a few times, and &quot;quantitative transaction&quot; became the &quot;quantitative transaction&quot; became becoming a quantitative transaction. The focus of controversy in China&#39;s capital market. Focusing on whether the quantitative fund is &quot;the tool of cutting leeks and the vampire of the stock market&quot;, the market has set off a round of discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The low -key head quantification fund has continued to reveal news. At the end of August, according to a number of media reports such as the Securities Times and the brokerage company China, Qiu Huiming, the founder of Minghong Investment, won the Shanghai &quot;First House&quot; for 285 million yuan. At the end of October, the news of other head -of -the -art founders was widely spread in the asset management circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The chairman of a private equity institution said to the southern weekend reporter: &quot;The biggest problem of the quantitative fund is that no one has disclosed specific operations to the outside world.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; mysterious quantitative investment How is it operating? Why does quantitative investment become the target of criticism when the stock market is sluggish? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Southern Weekend reporters recently interviewed a large number of domestic quantitative investors. Interestingly, they are eager to explain to the outside world what they are quantified, but they want to hide behind the scenes- &quot;Low -key, we must be low -key.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Believers of Simmons &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In 2010, American high -speed network supplier SPREAD Networks cost $ 300 million to build a grown between Chicago and New York and New York The most direct optical cable of 1330 kilometers is to shorten the time for high -frequency traders to obtain information by 0.003 seconds. Michael Lewis tells this true story in the book &quot;High -frequency trader: Wall Street Speed ​​Game&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Just this year, China ’s Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 stock index futures were officially launched, providing hedge tools for domestic quantitative investment. Many Chinese returned to China from Wall Street to start a business. In 2010, it was recognized as the first year of Chinese quantification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since the development, the data provided by a head quantitative private equity executive to the southern weekend is: domestic funds plus Shanghai -Hong Kong Stock Connect, QFII and other overseas funds. The ratio ratio is 25%-30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Father of Quantitative Investment&quot; James Simmons is the spiritual mentor of these practitioners. Most of the interviewees mentioned the book &quot;Conquer the Market&quot;. This book records the story of how Simmons successfully converts mathematical algorithms and computer transaction software into &quot;stock market gold rush&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The book mentioned that the origin of quantitative investment dates back to the late 1980s. Prior to this, no one believed that computers could invest like humans, but quantitative investors behind Simmons believed that &quot;there must be a way to model price.&quot; They do not think that the market is &quot;randomly walking&quot; unpredictable. Although there is a certain randomness, if it is distributed with a certain probability, it can predict the future price trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among the believers in James Simmons, more Chinese are beyond the imagination of ordinary people. A high -frequency trader who returned to China in 2015 can&#39;t understand why there are so many Chinese people who do quantitatively in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Chinese account for at least one -third of the proportion. They are spreading all over the New York Stock Exchange and various institutions of Nasdaq, either IT or data models.&quot; He told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Sam, the founder of a domestic head quantified agency, believes that this is well understood, &quot;Chinese people are not outstanding in other aspects. Investment banks are also good, but do you know people?&quot; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; After graduating from Dr. SAM, he became a high -frequency trader on Wall Street. He tried a procedural transaction in the domestic market around 2006. &quot;But at that time, the domestic market data took 15 seconds to me, and the order was 15 seconds to the exchange. &quot;. SAM told reporters from the Southern Weekend that it should not exceed 3 seconds back and forth, and delay will bring price changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In June 2013, the new &quot;People&#39;s Republic of China Securities Investment Fund Law&quot; was officially implemented. Private equity was allowed to record and open an account. You can issue autonomous products without the need to use the securities firm channel. This year SAM returned to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;When returning to China, the speed can reach within 1 second, and now the Shenzhen Exchange can achieve a few milliseconds. However, in the US market, everyone is pursuing microseconds (one millisecond is equal to 1000 microseconds). &quot;He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this stage, some senior people of some overseas -top quantitative institutions began to return to China to start a business, including Ren Sihong of Jinyu Assets, Wang Chen invested by Jiu Kun, Xu Xiaobo, who invested in Ruitian, Qiu Huiming invested by Mingzheng, and Yin Yin, Yin Yin, Yin Yin Xu Shunan and others of Nuo assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2014, Cai Meijie, deputy president of CICC Sales and Exchange Department, founded the establishment of Lingjun Investment; in 2015, the three Zhejiang University Computer Department, including Xu Jin, shifted from the IT field to a versatile investment, and created a fantasy party to create a fantasy party Quantify. Fantasy Fang, Ming Hong, Jiukun, and Ling are all called the &quot;Four Great Kings&quot;, and each asset management scale exceeds 60 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2015, China ’s quantitative private equity is mainly hedge products. In the second half of 2015, the stock index futures were limited, and the overall scale of private equity in three years did not increase and fall. In 2021, quantitatively entered a period of rapid development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;2021 is the most lively year. The industry scale is basically doubled. &quot;A quantitative practitioner told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this stage, Mingzheng Investment and Fantasy Fang Investment once expanded the management scale to 100 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;Where is the talent &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Where are we&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; , China quantitatively the &quot;Four King of Heaven&quot; fantasy, Jiu Kun, Lingjun, Minghong, etc. all have office sites. They are close to the Tsinghua Science and Technology Park, Zhongguancun Chuangye Street and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This site is selected because &quot;where is the talent and where are we.&quot; These companies have gathered high students from famous universities around the world, including Stanford, Cambridge, and MIT. On the propaganda wall of an institution, Qingbei Zhejiang University ranked the last three. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are many people in the head quantified company,&quot; a practitioner told a southern weekend reporter. When there was a quantitative investment institution recruited people, it proposed that &quot;the winner of the Tsinghua Yao Ban and the Olympic Medal will not take it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2005, Yao Qizhi, a world -renowned computer scientist and founder of the world&#39;s modern cryptographic foundation, founded the Tsinghua Academy&#39;s computer science experimental class. This class was referred to as &quot;Yao Ban&quot;. There is a saying that &quot;China&#39;s talents in Tsinghua, Tsinghua&#39;s talents in Yao Ban&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The original intention of Yao Ban was to screen and cultivate the world&#39;s most top computer genius. A graduate of Tsinghua University described this, &quot;This is the most tip -to -pointed person in the nation&#39;s number one computer department.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most of these young people are post -90s and men and women. They knocked on the keyboard in the office, and there were four huge computer screens on the desk. At a glance, it is a line of code data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The division of labor in traditional subjective funds is that analysts provide information, fund managers make decisions, and traders specifically execute order transactions according to the instructions of the fund manager. &quot;The quantitative fund has no concept of trader or trader, but is called a strategic developer and quantitative engineer.&quot; Wang Xiong, the founder of Siyuan quantified, told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The person who sets the model is the core person of the quantitative company. The model is composed of people+computing power. The development of quantitative trading strategies involves technologies such as mathematical models, statistical analysis, machine learning. Engineers will write and test code, and use historical data for recovery to evaluate the potential performance of the strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, their work content can be summarized as three words &quot;writing code&quot;, &quot;more like a code farmer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In February 2023, the head quantitative company&#39;s fantasy recipe and Ruitian Investment Division, the reason is that Rui Tian Investment took away the team and joined the fantasy party. Due to the long -term high contact of the strategist personnel, the strategy personnel have been highly exposed to heights for a long time. Core business secrets in quantitative investment -quantitative trading strategy code, Ruitian Investment believes that the other party is suspected of business secrets and improper competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to the competition of talents, quantitative funds also need to compete for computing power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;China holding the most high -performance GPU institutions is not an artificial intelligence company, but a quantitative investment company, and the fantasy party is the first.&quot; A domestic GPU agent told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The CPU familiar to ordinary people is responsible for reading the original data, temporarily exist in memory, and the GPU is to calculate the data of the data and the model of the training model. Brain experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person in the IT industry told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;CPUs are also dozens of physical Cores, and the GPU has tens of thousands of CUDA Core.&quot; Core can be understood as the core of the operation and use GPU to train a big one. The model is probably monthly, correspondingly. If the traditional CPU is probably annually calculated, the training efficiency is huge, and the gap between the reasoning efficiency is more than 100 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nvidia A100 graphics card is a professional GPU, which is very powerful and can reach 19.5 TFLOPS (floating -point operations of 19.5 trillion times per second). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, AI company was established with a quantitative formula, equipped with 1,100 GPUs. In 2021, the Nvidia A100 graphics card owned by the magic side has reached tens of thousands. The above IT people are shocked by this number, which has broken through the reserves of some major Internet factories in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; SAM explanation, starting in 2016, quantitative investment is based on the low -frequency Alpha plus T+0 (within the daily circulation transaction) as the main style. After 2018, it is a full -cycle model and deep learning model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Assuming that if you do a deep learning model, the researchers need to keep trying to try different parameters, structures, and characteristics. A researcher can get dozens of cards. Of course They are all occupied, but it is difficult for a person to think of so many ideas at the same time. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; For a researcher, you can configure dozens of cards. The above IT industry people think that this is bragging. He graduated from Tsinghua, and he made a model quantified in a large factory, and the configuration was one card alone. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Covers near &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; 2000 &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Only stocks &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; &lt;/strongRong >; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Few people know how to make money for quantitative investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A personal investor who purchased the fantasy -based quantitative product, he pointed at the romantic story of quantitative giants. But for quantitative investment, she admitted to the southern weekend reporter: &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The chairman of a private equity fund with a scale of another fund management scale has invested a lot of family assets into the head quantitative company. His understanding of quantitativeization is to mass slaughter according to the behavior model of tourism and retail investors, and the quantitative self -employed strategies and transactions are preferred by asset management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Open Source Fund, explained to the south weekend reporter with the &quot;dog walking theory&quot;. &quot;Value investment is more concerned about the walking route of people (fundamentals), but quantification is mainly to make excess returns by discovering the movement of dogs (stock prices).&quot; Yang Delong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative transactions, overseas called &quot;Quantitative Trading&quot; or &quot;Quantitative Investment&quot;, Quantitative (quantified) is corresponding to Discretionary. The latter refers to the judgment and understanding of one thing, the decision -making process depends on personal judgment, and has a greater degree of freedom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Quantitative data is based on data, with the mathematical model (statistical model) as the core, it is completely based on data. We call it quantitative and subjective investment is more qualitative.&quot; Sam To the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In his opinion, both individual investors and institutional investors, everyone has behavioral inertia, but the way of thinking may not be completely rational, and it will make mistakes in the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He divides quantification into two parts. The quantitative analysis of fundamentals is very similar to the publicity of publicity, cash flow and other public data. However, in the other part, quantification will grasp the wrong transactions of the market, that is, deviate from a reasonable price transaction formulated by quantitative models. &quot;After catching the wrong transaction, we buy it as if it is lower than the reasonable price, and sell it higher than the reasonable price.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Taking Moutai as an example, subjective investment may judge that the stock will rise, but the quantification will clearly have a clearly one. Forecast: &quot;We will say that this stock will win 1%of the market in the next 10 days, and the error is ± 5%, which is completely a statistical concept.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Data -based), the company&#39;s stock price shows a certain regular distribution. This reasonable price refers to a range. &quot;A quantitative practitioner told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Delong believes that quantification and value investment are essentially different. &quot;Quantitativeness is more to make money by fluctuations in stock prices, so they are called cutting leeks. Value investment is generally held for several years. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative practitioners do not avoid it. Most of the domestic mainstream quantitative private equity uses statistical arbitrage as its core strategy. The prediction cycle ranges from within a few days to a few days, and generally does not exceed 10 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are no standards and characteristics of quantitative selection of stocks, and do not set up industries and fields. They do not pay attention to whether the enterprise has new products, nor does it pay attention to what the secretary said. When the stock price is calculated based on the model, it belongs to the &quot;super buy&quot;, and the quantification will directly touch the selling stocks, and there is no human emotional and subjective judgment in the middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A number of head quantitative practitioners told reporters from the Southern Weekend that a mature large -scale quantitative company will scan more than 5,000 stocks on the market. Good can be done, and the mobility is not good. The difference is that they earn more and less money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Our bottom warehouse has now covered nearly 2,000 stocks of A shares.&quot; SAM told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared with it, 50 stocks holding 50 shares are considered many. This brings a huge difference in the turnover rate. A broker person told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;The turnover rate of public funds for equity is generally 3-5 times, up to about 10 times, which is more active.&quot; &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; Quantitative practitioners provided by reporters from the south weekend is that most of the mainstream products of the current quantitative private placement are generally 50-100 times. above. The annual exchange rate of the quantitative strategy of stock is about 100 times, which is equivalent to the average holding cycle of about 5 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sam decided to return to China to start a business in 2013. One of the important reasons is that &quot;the proportion of domestic individual investors at that time could reach 90%, and the entire market was too speculative. Alpha can be 6%, but at that time the domestic market could achieve nearly 40%. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Alpha and Beta were the risk quantitative indicators proposed by the Nobel Prize winner William Sharp in 1964. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative company relies on thousands of Alpha to find various laws in the market. Southern Weekend reporters visited a number of domestic head quantitative companies in mid -November. In their office areas, Alpha&#39;s &quot;A&quot; was made in the most eye -catching position. Alpha and Beta are also frequent words in the mouth of practitioners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Lei is a post -90s private equity supervisor. He gave the southern weekend reporter as an example. If he was pursuing Alpha&#39;s strategy, assuming that the broader market (with Wind A full A index as an example) increased by 10%a year and a certain strategy rose 12%. ) It is 2%. If the strategy can maintain this excess level, the market fell by 10%in the second year, and the strategy will only fall 8%, or there is still a 2%excess income. The pursuit of Alpha refers to the pursuit of long -term can win the broader market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If it is pursuing Beta, it is a concept of multiple. For example, the market has risen by 10%this year, and a strategy has risen by 1.5*10%= 15%, but if the market fell 10%the next year, it was 10%. It will also fall 1.5*10%= 15%. It is equal to the fluctuations of the broader market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Can you win the market for quantitative investment? According to the private equity duct network, as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, the average quantitative private equity revenue of 537 more than the performance was 3.36%, and the proportion of positive returns accounted for more than 70%. The average value of tens of billions of quantitative private equity is 5.75%, and the proportion of positive income companies accounted for over 90%. &lt;br>; &lt;br>; SAM said to the reporter of the Southern Weekend: &quot;Quantitativeness is stronger than subjective in the short -term reasonable pricing ability, but in the middle and long periods of reasonable pricing In -depth analysis, this is not currently quantified. &lt;br>; &lt;br>; Even the Renaissance Technology Corporation founded by James Simmons, after many years of high -speed growth, the three funds of their three funds also performed bleak in 2020. According to Bloomberg reports in February 2021, the Bloomberg reported that the three funds opened by the Renaissance to ordinary investors have been redeemed at least 5 billion US dollars (about 32.2 billion yuan) since December 1, 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Quantitative dispute &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On August 27, 2023, &quot;reduced sealing stamp duty, staged tightening IPO, re -financing rhythm, regulatory shares to reduce holdings Behavioral and reduced financing margin ratio &quot;, the favorable policies have been arrowed in one day. However, the next day, the A -share opening was 5%higher and fell quickly, and the closing increase was only 1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Who is the culprit? Quantitativeization has become the target of public criticism. Many investors believe that the opening of the market has triggered a huge quantitative fund to sell, and the latter is the &quot;largest air force&quot; of market fluctuations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A saliva battle began in the circle of friends who invest in big brothers. Investors who oppose quantitativeization have brushed the article &quot;Quantitative Fund, the main force of today&#39;s Smiling&quot; to 100,000+, and the founders of many head quantitative agencies reprinted another article- &quot;Quantitative is the Big Bya of the Big A&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On September 1, 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission guided the Stock Exchange to introduce a series of measures to strengthen the procedural transaction supervision. Among them, &quot;transaction behaviors with a maximum application of the highest declaration reached more than 300 or more per second, or the maximum number of declarations in a single day reached more than 20,000 transactions&quot; and so on. And make additional reports of high -frequency transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But a number of interviewed quantitative practitioners said: &quot;300 and 20,000 declared standards per second and the standards of 20,000 reports have little impact on quantification.&quot; The number of strokes reaches 20,000, the account is small, but it can be done very high. But if you change your hands and large scale, this number is also possible. SAM Example: For example, a public offer has a billions of accounts, and it is not high to change hands. There are only 5%unilateral one day and only 10%in bilateral. There are also more than 20,000 pens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;If you see the transaction opportunity, 5,000 stocks have the opportunity. In theory, we can realize 5,000 orders in one second. At most 1,000, &quot;SAM told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative practitioners have repeatedly emphasized that programmatic transactions are not only pointing out transactions. Procedural transactions refer to investment tools corresponding to &quot;manual transactions&quot;. Thousands of assets, and manual transactions cannot be done. In addition to quantitative and private equity, public offering funds and subjective investment will also use programmatic transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The huge fluctuations in A shares in 2015, and Ishton manipulated the futures market case. The company is illegally profitable to make more than 2 billion yuan in transaction rules such as procedural trading software, self -buying and selling, and using the ratio of margin leverage ratio. The average order speed of Ishton is one per second. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; SAM said that stock index futures are particularly suitable for high -frequency varieties. Ionton was the second level that year, and it has not changed much. But &quot;there are fewer people who speculate in futures, and they are gambling, and the mainstream is mainly based on stock quantification.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The founder of Siyuan quantitative Wang Xiong told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;As far as the quantitative stocks are concerned, A -share transactions cannot have high frequencies of so -called ultimate pursuit of speed in foreign countries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From the perspective of the transaction mechanism, due to the imposed stamp duty, recognized high -frequency transactions in China&#39;s stock market basically do not exist. &quot;Because you can&#39;t make money, the speed advantage of a few seconds, the money you earn can&#39;t cover the stamp duty.&quot; Sam told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to him, the shortest position in China is currently 5 minutes to 20 minutes. It can not be regarded as high frequency overseas. At most, it is only within daytime transactions. At one time, it was only a few minutes slow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sam still remember that when he was a high -frequency trader on Wall Street, he kept changing his hands, and 10 million US dollars could build up to $ 200 million. &quot;In China, our holding positions are about 5 days. In these 5 days, we are not pursuing how to grab this list as soon as possible, but to pursue a better excess performance.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In addition, the matching of the exchange of the exchange The speed is not supported. &quot;As an example, you send a list in the past, and it takes 30 milliseconds to wait for the return. Everyone in the United States is pursuing 1 microsecond, so you 30 milliseconds ± 1 millisecond fluctuations. Pursuing that 1 microsecar is meaningless. . &quot;Sam told the reporter from the Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But they are actually trying to pursue speed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A founder of a quantitative agency revealed to the reporter of the Southern Weekend that the domestic exchanges have their own server custody centers for traders who require trading speed. , Shenzhen Stock Exchange South Center Shenzhen Tong Tukai Machine Room and Shanghai Stock Exchange Golden Bridge Custody Machine Room. Only securities and futures companies can rent the custody machine room cabinets from the exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; High -end programmatic trading teams usually purchase their own equipment or specify the designated hardware configuration. They are purchased by securities and futures companies. With the consent of securities and futures companies, they are placed in the rental cabinets for transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Around 2014, Huabao Securities launched the LTS system, which is the first speed trading counter system in the industry. Since then, many brokers have begun to &quot;fire -fighting speed transactions&quot;, and most of them are quantitative private equity customers. , But there is a threshold for the amount of funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The funding threshold for the speed trading counter is not a hard rule, but we generally publicize it is the exclusive to high net worth customers. Each threshold is different, some are 1 million yuan, and some 3 million yuan.&quot; One Brokers told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A private equity institution practitioner said to the southern weekend reporter: &quot;Now the larger quantitative funds, high frequencies are used for self -employment, operated by self -operated funds and leverage. The performance is asset management. How many times. &quot;But the self -operated scale data cannot be queried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (responding request: SAM, Yang Lei as a pseudonym) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https:// /feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.run &lt;/a>; &lt;bR >;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[出生3个月被拐，25年后找回：新技术助力“天下无拐”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261899]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-05 20:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; Recently, Hebei &quot;billionaire&quot; Xie Kefeng recovered the news of the 25-year-old son Xie Qingshuai, The wide spread on the Internet has attracted great attention, and netizens have been happy to reunite for the final reunion. Behind this, it is inseparable from the blessing of scientific and technological power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to media reports, the reunion of Jiejia, the &quot;New Age and Profile Face Comparison Algorithm&quot; developed by a technology company contributed. When Xie Qing was born, he was born 3 months when he was abducted, and his family had only a photo of his 3 months in his hands. Twenty years later, using this baby&#39;s photo to find people is obviously &quot;impossible task.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The impossible impossible is to compare with a person with affinity to find a suspected object. Take the findings of Xie Qing and handsome, and use the photos of his biological parents and elder brothers to compare with the police&#39;s population database. This comparison is of course vague, and multiple results may occur, but it also greatly reduces the search range, which is convenient for police to accurately compare through DNA detection and other technologies. In this comparison, he found Qing Shuai in the top five suspected objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Looking for the &quot;black technology&quot; used by trafficking children, the most familiar is DNA comparison technology. This technology was first used by police to determine the suspect in major criminal cases. With the decline in inspection and comparison costs, the application of DNA technology is becoming more and more extensive, and in the abduction and finding relatives, it also played the role of the ultimate &quot;one hammer&quot; determining the relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But the DNA comparison also has great limitations, that is, the samples of both parties can be compared. Naturally, parents who look for their relatives will naturally submit their own blood samples to the police, but it is not so easy to get the sample of the abducted child. DNA information is one of the most sensitive biological information for individuals. Without sufficient evidence, the police cannot randomly force anyone to submit their DNA samples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The police had the data of the children in the DNA database. Many of them knew that they were submitted to the police and hoped to find their biological parents. Other data come from the trafficking person who rescued the police during the abduction operation. Those who do not know that they are trafficked and have not been noticed by the police, their DNA information will not appear in the abduction database, and it will not be found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, the police have set up more than 3,000 free blood collection points across the country, and are widely propagated, hoping that more people can take the initiative to provide blood samples and improve the coverage of the database. But the number of people who can be included in the DNA database is always limited. Previously, the commonly used methods for family -finding families were &quot;human flesh&quot; search. They followed any possible clues and traveled all year round to find relatives across the country, exhausting time, energy and money. However, the effect was not ideal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The application of high -tech methods such as identification is greatly improved, which greatly improves the efficiency of family search. As early as 2019, the police began to use Tencent&#39;s new age face recognition technology, and used a photo of an abducted child at the age of 3 to successfully find a child who had been abducted for 10 years. But the technology at that time was not accurate enough. According to his father, every time he was identified, 100 suspected personnel would be found. Police generally adopted the top 5 DNA review, and there was no chance of hitting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With the advancement of computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, the accuracy of comparison is getting higher and higher. You can even compare it with a photo of your children without using a photo of close relatives. Because everyone has left photos of ID cards in the police&#39;s database, recognized with photos, which greatly improves the scope of abduction and comparison, and it is easier to find the child who is trafficked. In just half a year, the &quot;New Age Face Comparison Algorithm&quot; helped the police to find 4 trafficking children. At least 3 of them have been abducted for more than 20 years, and their abilities can be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Advanced technology is used for abduction and finding relatives, and is a giant for goodness. Of course, it must be acknowledged that if it is used for evil, its destructive power is also huge. For example, DNA parent -child appraisal may be used to fake parent -child appraisal proof, and the child who has been trapped as his &quot;biological&quot; child is settled in the police station. Of course, this is a fraud, and maybe it can be said to have little to do with technology. However, the omnipresent face recognition, suspected of a lot of abuse, may infringe the privacy of ordinary people, and AI face changes and other technologies may also be used for crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There was a saying in the previous Internet called &quot;There are photos and truth&quot;. But with the development of PS technology, photos can no longer represent the truth. Someone replaced the avatars in the pornographic photo with facial changes and took it to extortion. With the advancement of the video face -changing technology, &quot;there is a video and the truth&quot; is no longer the truth. The current AI technology allows Trump to speak authentic Chinese. There is no flaw in the tone and mouth shape, and it is natural to create other videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The technology itself is neutral. Each black technology is a double -edged sword, which can be good or used for evil. Not only can technology itself be used for evil, but even fake advanced technologies can be used. The high -tech New age and family face comparison of relatives have just attracted attention, and rumors of &quot;toll version seeking APP&quot; appeared on the Internet. Those families who are eager to find their own flesh and flesh are easy to be fooled and they are deceived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Advanced technology contains huge power. How to use it is to do good or evil, and at all people who have mastered technology. Only as possible in the hands of &quot;good people&quot; as much as possible, and have a good system to motivate and prevent, can we play the best use of science and technology to the greatest extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But with the decline in costs, these new technologies will inevitably be obtained by more and more people, and the possibility of being abused and evil will become greater. How to avoid advanced technology as much as possible for evil is also a serious issue that must be explored. Some time ago, the &quot;palace fighting drama&quot; of OpenAI&#39;s OpenAI company was developed, which was related to the attitude towards AI technology to a certain extent. It can be seen that this is not a topical topic, but an imminent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[厦门警方通报2名老师涉嫌性侵大四女生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261932]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-05 19:39:47 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;pan>; On the evening of December 4, 2023, &quot;A number Female intern&#39;s post has attracted attention. &lt;/SPAN>; &lt;span>; On the evening of December 5, the police in Xiamen Lake reported that the suspect had been criminally detained in accordance with the law for suspected rape.
