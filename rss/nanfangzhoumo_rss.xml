There was a black thermos cup and a plain backpack on the lectern. An old man wearing a light blue long-sleeved shirt and rimless glasses sat on the lectern and said, &quot;Thank you to the students of NTU for not treating me like this so far.&quot; After leaving the podium, I completed my teaching career.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The old man&#39;s name is Mo Lifeng. He is a professor at the School of Liberal Arts of Nanjing University, the director of the Chinese Poetry Research Center of Nanjing University, and the first president of Mei&#39;an Academy. At the age of 74, he completed the last lesson of his teaching career that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1979, Mo Lizhen was admitted to Nanjing University and began to study ancient literature. He later stayed at the school to teach. This is now his 44th year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is little known is that Mo Lizhen was also the first doctor of literature in New China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1981, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council announced the list of the first batch of doctoral supervisors in New China. This group of industry elites, who represented the highest level of academic circles at that time, trained the first batch of PhDs in New China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 1984, Mo Lifeng’s doctoral thesis defense was broadcast on CCTV’s news network, and he also received the first doctorate in literature certificate after the founding of the People’s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a senior professor in the field of ancient Chinese literature, Mo Lizhen had nothing to do with ancient literature in the first half of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 1949, Mo Lizhen was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu. In 1966, when he graduated from high school, he applied for the engineering major at Tsinghua University. In July of that year, the college entrance examination enrollment was suspended, and the dream of becoming an engineer was shattered in an instant. For the next ten years, he went to the countryside to join the army and spent his bitter youth in the fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, his life turned around - he entered the English major of Anhui University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, with the launch of reform and opening up and the resumption of postgraduate education, Mo Lizhen seized the opportunity again. In 1979, the second year after the postgraduate examination was resumed, after studying for three semesters in the English Department of Anhui University, he was admitted to the postgraduate program of the Chinese Department of Nanjing University and embarked on the research path of ancient literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retirement, he is still committed to the popularization of Tang and Song poetry, giving lectures and participating in book fairs... He once said that his biggest wish is to stand at the entrance of the &quot;Secret Land of Fairy Mountains&quot; about Tang poetry and Song poetry, giving guidance to tourists. On the way into the mountains, the tour guide explains the scenery along the way and tells everyone where there is a unique flavor and where there are winding paths. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, it was raining continuously in the south of the Yangtze River, passers-by were in a hurry, and the leaves of the sycamore tree fell with the raindrops. In a residential area in Xuanwu District, Nanjing, Mo Lizhen talked about his life experience. He quoted the Southern Dynasty philosopher Fan Zhen&#39;s metaphor of &quot;petals falling in the wind&quot; to describe his destiny - &quot;petals on a tree&quot; When it is blown down by the wind, the direction it falls is not determined by the petals, but by the wind.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There is no other way but to study&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You In previous interviews, you often mentioned your father, and also talked about the scene where &quot;brothers and sisters competed with their father to recite Tang poems.&quot; Did your love for literature sprout from your family environment? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My father comes from a rural area in Henan Province. He attended junior high school for more than a year. When the Japanese invaded China, he dropped out of school and became a soldier. After liberation, she has been working in a local supply and marketing cooperative, and her mother has only attended the first grade of junior high school. When I was young, my family was poor, so I read Tang poetry because my father happened to have a copy of &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot; at home. My father liked it, so we read it too. It was not until I graduated from high school and went to work in the countryside that I came into contact with more classical works. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The influence of my parents on me has nothing to do with the profession I am currently engaged in. Their biggest influence on me is that I am very sincere, hard-working, and have a good attitude towards life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have always performed very well on your way to school. I applied for the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics at Tsinghua University, but learned that the college entrance examination was suspended before the college entrance examination. How did I face this huge gap at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was in high school at Suzhou Middle School, which was a very good school. When I was in elementary and middle school, my performance in Chinese was average, but my math, physics and chemistry were pretty good. I graduated from high school in 1966, but that year the college entrance examination was abolished. All middle and high school students from 1966 to 1968 went to the countryside, and the university stopped recruiting students. Everyone is disappointed, but we have no choice but to face it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You started going to the countryside in the late autumn of 1968. During the ten years when I went to the countryside, I read tirelessly after working hard, and even read a &quot;Dictionary of New Terms&quot; intensively. You also mentioned the experience of reading by lighting a kerosene lamp. What was the reading environment like at that time? Did you have much time for reading? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, I don’t have much time to read. Collective labor took up a lot of time. At that time, rural areas in Jiangnan were really intensively farmed, and they spent a long time in the fields every day. Only when it rains heavily and around the Spring Festival, there is no work in the fields, and you can read a book on those days. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no electricity in the village, so they can only light kerosene lamps for lighting. One pound of kerosene is supplied as a quota for a month, and it is all consumed in a week, and there is no way to buy more. So, basically you have to sleep when it gets dark. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The books I read are also disorganized, because the books I get are all by chance, and I have no idea what I will read next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are most other people doing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have many educated youth friends who basically don’t study, but play poker. At that time, the &quot;uselessness of reading&quot; theory was popular. We used sickles and hoes to participate in agricultural labor, and the production team raised 6 cows to plow the fields. These agricultural labors did not require book knowledge. Everyone thought that reading was a stupid thing. In 1972, the university began to recruit workers, peasants and soldiers, but the number of places was very small and a recommendation system was adopted. Most people had no hope of entering the university, and I had no hope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In this complete &quot;theory that reading is useless&quot; In this case, why do you love reading? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are many reasons for this. First, I like reading. If I don’t read at all, I will feel that life is meaningless. Second, I was completely deprived of the opportunity to go to university. I felt resentful and determined to finish &quot;my university&quot; like Gorky. For self-study learning, there is no other way than reading. Five or six years after I went to the countryside, I completely gave up any hope of going to college again in this life. In fact, it was no longer possible. At that time, the higher authorities called on us to &quot;take root in the countryside&quot; for the rest of our lives. I was already mentally prepared to be a farmer who loves reading all my life. Farming and reading are a way of life advocated by our ancestors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, I have a vague feeling that the current situation of &quot;theory that reading is useless&quot; is abnormal. It will end sooner or later, but I don&#39;t know how long it will take. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/kfYND0AoqQx1wySkbrnVoXKWkoIQEKvbM5MTtRq9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;575&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/kfYND0AoqQx1wySkbrnVoXKWkoIQEKvbM5MTtRq9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255704&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1979, Mo Lizhen was admitted as a graduate student in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University and embarked on the research path of ancient literature. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;When I applied for the exam, I didn’t know who Cheng Qianfan was&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What was the opportunity for you to apply for the English Department of Anhui University when you took the college entrance examination in 1977? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was in Anhui at that time. The provincial admissions regulations at that time stipulated that candidates should not be over 25 years old. Only those with &quot;academic expertise&quot; &quot;Only the third grade of high school students are allowed to apply for the exam over the age limit. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was 28 years old and had graduated from high school 11 years ago, but I didn’t have any expertise. The cultural and educational officers in the commune sympathized with me. He noticed that I was reading a thick original English novel during that time, which I borrowed from my classmate’s uncle. The officer recognized that I was good at English, so he allowed me to register for the college entrance examination with the qualification of “specializing in English”. After enrolling in school, I found that some students actually filled in the &quot;study expertise&quot; casually, and no one came to evaluate it at all. But I was more honest, so I signed up for the English major and was admitted to the English Department of Anhui University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the year of reform and opening up in 1978, postgraduate education was also restored, and You were studying in the English Department of Anhui University for three semesters, and then you decided to apply for a graduate degree in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University. What was your original intention for doing so? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The original intention is very simple. The monthly scholarship can be increased from 18 yuan to 35 yuan. I received a monthly stipend of 18 yuan at Ann University, so my money was very tight. On the morning when I set out from the dormitory of Anda University to go to the Provincial Department of Education to check the admissions catalogs of famous universities, I had not yet thought about applying for the Chinese Department. I originally wanted to take the exam at the Foreign Languages ​​Department of NTU, but the Foreign Languages ​​Department requires me to take a second foreign language test - French, German or Spanish. But I had never studied it, so I could only temporarily change it to the Chinese department. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You were only your sophomore year when you applied for graduate school. It shouldn&#39;t have been common at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was not allowed to take the postgraduate entrance examination in my sophomore year, but it was special at that time. The common situation among our 77-year undergraduate students is that the students are older. The oldest and youngest in my class are 13 years apart. At that time, the English major of the Department of Foreign Languages ​​at Ann University was divided into 7 classes, and I was in Class 7. Class 6 is an express class. Many students are from Beijing and Shanghai and have a good foundation in English. They believe that they have the level to graduate from a bachelor&#39;s degree. So, they asked the school to take the postgraduate entrance examination in advance. The school did not agree at first, but they kept trying. In the end, the school relented and said, considering that you are older, you will study for four more years as an undergraduate and you will be in your thirties when you graduate. That’s when I decided to open this hole. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My classmates encouraged me to take the postgraduate entrance examination with my classmates in Class 6. As a result, I happened to pass the exam, so I came to Nantah University to study ancient Chinese literature. The most interesting thing is that when I applied, I knew nothing about ancient literature at NTU. When I saw that the tutor on the admission brochure was Mr. Cheng Qianfan, I had no idea who he was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From science and engineering to English to ancient literature, we are doing these Are there any consistent principles or concepts when making important choices? How do you view the contingency and inevitability among them? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;These are not decided by me, but by fate. I am a person who goes with my fate. I have often said in recent years that we are like petals on a tree, which float down as soon as the wind blows them. We don’t know where they will float in advance. The direction of the float is not determined by the petals, but by the wind. I just drifted to Nanda. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Accidentality definitely contains inevitability, but from the perspective of the overall environment, it is still accidental. If the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; had not broken out in 1966, I would either have failed to get into Tsinghua University, or I would have studied engineering if I had gotten into it. My biggest ideal at that time was to be an engineer, and my father also expected the same from me. Unfortunately, it was many years after his death that I entered college. It is the biggest regret in my life that my father did not see me become a college student, graduate student, and university professor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fate of the third generation is almost the same. They have no choice in many things. Some classmates were lucky enough to be recruited back then, but after arriving in the city, they had to follow the arrangements of which factory they would work in and what kind of work they would do. We are very lucky to be able to recruit workers. We are all very envious. After all, we can get wages, but farmers can only earn work points, and the value of a day&#39;s work points is only two or three cents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there is also subjective initiative in this. I have never given up studying, but many classmates have given up. Some of my classmates in Suzhou Middle School had very good grades, but after the college entrance examination was resumed, they had already gotten married and had families with two or three children, so they no longer wanted to take the exam. They were soon laid off and had no chance of college in their lives. There are many such people. When encountering that &quot;strong wind&quot;, they were blown into the mud and never had a chance to stand up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/lmKOzcxvroJZpvIKZIXnQFhta4ogGIFCqRVVjxH7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;618&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/lmKOzcxvroJZpvIKZIXnQFhta4ogGIFCqRVVjxH7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255705&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1980, Mo Lizhen and his tutor Cheng Qianfan discussed academic issues in the study. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Ascetic training&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your teacher-student friendship with Mr. Cheng Qianfan has also been praised by everyone. Do you still remember the first time you and Mr. Cheng The scene during a meeting? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I first met Mr. Cheng, he was 66 years old and his hair was already gray. The first thing he said to us was: &quot;Many candidates came to me before the exam and came to see me at home. Some even brought gifts. There are only three of you (Mo Lifeng, senior brother Xu Youfu and junior brother Zhang Sanxi). ) I haven’t even written a letter, so that’s good!”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;The Degree Regulations had not been officially promulgated when you enrolled in 1979. It was not until the State Council approved the &quot;Interim Implementation Measures for the Degree Regulations&quot; in 1981 that the degree system was formally established. Was studying for a Ph.D. considered an adventure at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At the opening ceremony in September 1979, President Kuang Yaming said that degree regulations were being formulated. He is a member of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council and is involved in this work. We do not distinguish between master&#39;s and doctoral students when enrolling, they are collectively referred to as graduate students. President Kuang Yaming said that you will be the first batch of masters and doctoral students in the future. We graduated two years later and the degree regulations were promulgated. I received my master&#39;s degree and later continued my Ph.D. studies with Mr. Cheng. I think studying for a Ph.D. is a good thing, and it doesn’t feel “adventurous” at all. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before you actually start studying for a Ph.D., what do you think about the Ph.D. What are the expectations of life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are no specific expectations. Who knows what a PhD career will be like. I just feel that studying for a master&#39;s degree is so hard and stressful, and studying for a PhD will definitely make it even more stressful, so I am mentally prepared to sit on the bench for a few years. Anyway, I went through a lot of hardships when I was young. &quot;There was a time when it was difficult to find water in the sea.&quot; Studying for a Ph.D. will definitely not be more difficult than farming. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At that time, we did not have independent Ph.D. As the first batch of PhDs in literature, how did you study for your PhD, take classes and write your doctoral thesis? It is said that when you first started studying for a Ph.D., Mr. Cheng didn’t know how far the doctoral thesis would go. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;That’s true, because doctorate is a new thing in China. There was no complete curriculum system at that time, and the training model was explored in secret. Mr. Cheng didn&#39;t know how far he would go in writing his doctoral thesis. He borrowed a bunch of foreign published doctoral theses from the school library, as well as many doctoral theses from universities in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He read several of them before he had an idea. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Where does Mr. Cheng’s training method come from? Forming? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think he figured it out himself. Of course, it may also be derived from the academic standards of doctoral dissertations abroad or in Hong Kong and Taiwan. from. Since I was the only doctoral student in the department at that time, Mr. Cheng did not teach me any classes. Except for foreign languages, my course study was entirely based on special book reading, that is, I read by myself, and when I encountered difficulties, I went to my husband’s house for advice. Mr. Cheng asked me to study eight classics: &quot;The Book of Songs&quot;, &quot;Chu Ci&quot;, &quot;The Analects of Confucius and Mencius&quot;, &quot;Laozi and Zhuangzi&quot;, &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, &quot;Historical Records&quot;, &quot;Selected Works&quot; and &quot;Wen Xin Diao Long&quot;. Each book required a reading report, and four of the reports were later published as academic papers. That kind of training model is a bit like the old-time craftsmen taking apprentices. The master teaches step by step, and the apprentice learns while working. For a subject like ancient Chinese literature, that method is quite effective. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When graduate education was resumed in 1978, students were admitted that year 10,000 people. Today, there are approximately 560,000 PhD students. Many doctoral students cannot help but worry about their employment prospects and are confused about the future, especially liberal arts doctoral students. Are you also confused when you graduate with your PhD, and how do you deal with their current worries and confusion? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I graduated with my PhD in 1984, I was assigned a job and could choose from many units. In the end, I chose to stay at NTU. At that time, the number of people with master&#39;s and doctorate degrees trained by the country was small, and there was objectively no employment pressure. This is different from the situation of many liberal arts doctorates today. I understand the current students very well. There are many doctoral students but few positions. After years of large-scale expansion of postgraduate enrollment, most units have no shortage of people, so it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a job. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is entirely a problem of the times, not a personal problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also difficult for my students to find jobs. If I can&#39;t find a job, the pressure will extend to me. Of course, the three doctoral students who graduated this year have all found jobs, going to Sichuan University, South Central University for Nationalities and Zhejiang Normal University respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/1oMhfOmrHc3MQsFfLDaH9gy2B27iG9KPackfRB5z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/1oMhfOmrHc3MQsFfLDaH9gy2B27iG9KPackfRB5z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255703&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2008, Mo Lizhen signed a book signing for Baijia Forum in Beijing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Committed to researching &quot;everyone&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once mentioned that the study of ancient literature is mainly about reversing the case, because all viewpoints have been People have said that the new point of view is to write an article to reverse the verdict.

What is your original intention in choosing to study these &quot;masters&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, all academic research is about reversing the case, and the same is true for science and engineering. When I was studying for a PhD at NTU, the school recruited 10 doctoral students in the first batch, each from a different department. There are three people living in our dormitory, one from the chemistry department and the other from the computer science department. I communicated with them and found that they do research, find topics and write papers, just like us. They all make a living in the cracks of previous achievements, in very small directions. Pursue some innovations to supplement or overturn previous research results. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for the subject of ancient literature, what can truly represent the academic achievements of an era should be &quot;everyone&#39;s&quot; research. Whether there is an overall breakthrough in the research of an era depends on how well &quot;everyone&quot; studies. &quot;Xiaojia&quot; research only fills the gap and cannot become a symbol of the academic level of an era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your two favorite poets are Du Fu and Su Shi, and you even once You said you were willing to travel back in time to the Song Dynasty and go to Huangzhou to help Su Shi farm. What do you think is the biggest realization they brought you in the process of studying Du Fu and Su Shi? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This may be related to Mr. Cheng’s proposition that “literary research should focus on feelings and words”. I started reading Du Fu and Su Shi before I entered college. The only motivation at that time was that I liked them. I felt warm and comforted when I read them. I have said many times that when I spent the night in that thatched hut whose roof was torn by the strong wind, and shivered with cold while looking at the sky full of stars, Du Fu&#39;s &quot;Song of Thatched Cottage Broken by the Autumn Wind&quot; brought me spiritual joy. Shocking. I have been farming for ten years, and I feel that being a farmer is not an inconvenience. But I really don’t want Su Dongpo to open up wasteland and farm in Huangzhou. An outstanding person like him with both ability and political integrity has more important things to do! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest realization that Du and Su brought to me is the human sentiment of &quot;being able to live in thousands of houses&quot; and the attitude towards life of &quot;taking care of one&#39;s life under the mist and rain&quot;. Willing to promote them as much as I can. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you achieve innovation in your &quot;Everyone&quot; research? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;True innovation is difficult. How can I do it? Because innovation requires you to see deeper or further than others, I don’t have that high level. In addition, innovation also requires chance. A good new topic or precious new material happens to appear. These are rare. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can only try my best not to follow what others say and not to repeat the same thing. I have done a lot of popularization work now, and I talk about some common sense content, but how to explain the common sense content accurately is also very demanding, which should be consistent with academic rigor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I have noticed that since entering the &quot;Baijia Forum&quot;, you have You have been committed to popularizing classical poetry. What was the opportunity to start popularizing it?

Has this wish come true now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was also by chance that I went to &quot;Hundred Schools Forum&quot;. During NTU&#39;s 100th Anniversary, we invited editors and directors from CCTV to record the program. After the recording, it was broadcast on the &quot;Hundred Forum&quot; and the effect was pretty good. Later, they came to me to talk about Tang poetry. After the program was broadcast, many viewers wrote in and the response was enthusiastic. I feel that the popularization work is quite meaningful. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I want to achieve most now is to make ordinary readers like Tang poetry and Song lyrics, Du Fu and Su Dongpo as much as I do. The so-called popularization means stepping out of the small classroom of school and heading towards the cathedral of society. What makes me happy is that when I give lectures, the audience includes people of all ages and identities. I have really reached the public, which can be regarded as realizing my wish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think the academic research and popularization of ancient literature are relevant nowadays? Facing some difficulties? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Current research tends to be conceptual and fragmented, while popularization work tends to become vulgar. The former, for example, must forcibly discover the modernity in some classical poems, but in fact there may not be. If some new terms are used to label something, the conclusion will not be consistent with the historical truth. There are also some scholars who choose topics that are too detailed and of little significance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Popularization work has a tendency to become vulgar. In order to attract the audience and cater to the tastes of young people, there are many jokes and misinterpretations, and the complete artistic conception of the ancients is fragmented and lacks a sense of integrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is there any solution? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This problem is inevitable. Going to the public will inevitably bring different tastes and requirements. I can only ask myself to do my best. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For today’s young people, especially college students and Do you have any life advice for graduate students? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was invited to attend the graduation ceremony of Anhui University in June this year and deliver a speech. I did not receive a diploma when I left Ann University 40 years ago. Now I am attending the ceremony as an &quot;outstanding alumnus&quot;, and I feel very emotional. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I quoted Dong Po&#39;s &quot;Ding Feng Bo&quot; at the ceremony to encourage the students to learn Dong Po&#39;s spirit of life and welcome their own stormy life. Because the lives of us ordinary people are bound to be full of ups and downs, we cannot imagine that we will embark on a smooth life path, so we must be fully mentally prepared. Please let me quote a few words from my speech at Ann University to send to college students and graduate students from other universities: &quot;I sincerely hope that students, like Dongpo, will always treat life with a positive attitude of &#39;continuous self-improvement&#39; and make a difference.&quot; . I also sincerely hope that when students encounter ups and downs in life, they will encourage themselves with the motto of &#39;You can live your life in the mist and rain&#39; and deal with it calmly!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[演唱会刷屏朋友圈，李健是中产抚慰者？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259370]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;When I miss you, you are in the sky; when I miss you, you are right in front of me.&quot; Recently, Li Jian held the &quot;Like the Sea&quot; online concert, which received more than 30 million views in 2 hours and quickly became a hit in the circle of friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In today&#39;s crowded entertainment industry, there are indeed few singers as lovable as Li Jian. We rarely hear music critics criticizing him, and we don’t see various marketing accounts on Weibo spreading any negative information about him. He is just famous, so popular that it is so natural and so popular that everyone expects it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/huSjlbT3I3FOoTHypGp5yeS64ovaHlSp8XRIbh88.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height= &quot;440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/huSjlbT3I3FOoTHypGp5yeS64ovaHlSp8XRIbh88.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255635&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; Birth: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Intellectual temperament&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Li Jian has such confidence. He graduated from Tsinghua University with a major in electronic engineering. Compared with many singers whose academic qualifications or cultural qualities are “meager”, Li Jian is outstanding. “Tsinghua top student” is an extremely enviable status, but it is also different from our expectations of science and engineering. The impression that a man is slovenly, unkempt, and ordinary-looking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s more important is Li Jian’s intellectual temperament. Li Jian’s home is neatly filled with records and books. The records he listens to include Leonard Cohen, The Beatles, Freshly Ground, Michael Buble, and Fabio Zanon, and the books he reads include Borges, Zweig, and Lawrence Bubble. Locke, George Orwell, and the last thing he took out was Leonard Cohen&#39;s biography &quot;I&#39;m Your Man.&quot; He has the sobriety and self-control of an intellectual. He consciously keeps a certain distance from the materialistic world and pursues advancement in the spiritual world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From his song selection, we can also see his independent temperament. Some people say that he is a &quot;musical poet&quot;, but in fact, he highlights more of his &quot;musical pride.&quot; For example, the online concert included 10 private covers and 14 original works, explaining his inner feelings about the sea and poetry. Li Jian is always singing in a low voice. He does not show off his skills or hit the high notes. His melody is soft and beautiful, and his singing voice is ethereal and graceful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the side of Li Jian&#39;s birth - he does not pursue external fame and wealth, but rather his pursuit, pride and persistence as an independent individual. In the lavish entertainment industry, he has not lost himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height= &quot;440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255636&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; Entering the WTO: I wish the newly graduated &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;all the best&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If this was all Li Jian looked like, maybe it would be difficult for him to be so lovable. After all, there are many aloof singer-songwriters in the music industry - for example, Liang Bo, whose song &quot;Soul Singer&quot; shocked everyone, but his popularity and audience base are far less than those of Li Jian, not to mention other niche singers. What is unique about Li Jian is that he also has a worldly side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Li Jian is not obsessed with material things, he is able to live a good life. He works out, travels, knows coffee, has a special tea room at home, and collects records... Every time he appears in front of the camera, his clothes always make people feel comfortable and comfortable. Li Jian&#39;s life has a cold style. He is not a popular brand that can be seen everywhere on the street. He is Fendi, LV and Hermes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some interviews, you can see that Li Jian is concerned about some issues that arise in social development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the topic &quot;I hope everyone will experience less setbacks and hardships&quot; became a hot topic on Weibo. Not long ago, he told young people at a concert: &quot;I hope all people can live a simple and easy life.&quot; &quot;You can live a good life without putting in a lot of effort, especially those who have just graduated. It would be better if you experience less setbacks and tribulations. I wish you all the best.&quot; He is not cynical about the predicament. , not hoarse, but blessing and moving forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like his song selection, he is always singing about love, hometown, childhood, moonlight, stars, years and other beautiful things. He does not directly criticize vulgarity, but he sings about beautiful things in a tortuous way. this purpose. You might say Li Jian is &quot;conservative&quot;, but he is very safe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何况，李健还是一个接地气的“耿直boy+高萌的段子手+可爱的吃货”，轻描淡写就能够把许多严肃的、刻板的话语方式消解掉，让人会心一笑，并察觉到他的可爱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，在李健身上，出世和入世是如此完美地组合在一起。很多人只能做到一点，或者连一点都做不好，或者在二者之间撕扯纠缠，李健完美地拥有了二者，他是很多人的人格理想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无怪乎不少评论说，李健是中产的灵魂抚慰者。李健的歌迷虽然囊括了各个群体，但诚如媒体人朱伟所说，喜欢李健的人主要是“文青”“小资”“受过良好教育且感情细腻的群体”。这些人都是属于中产阶层或者预备中产阶层。如果说中国中产阶层有什么显著的特点，在出世入世之间“撕扯”便是其一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中产们既有入世的一面，他们追求物质，追求格调，安分守己，保守中庸，渴望岁月静好、现世安稳的生活；可遗憾的是，为了这岁月静好，他们又得奔走在大都市的钢筋水泥森林，疲于应付职场中的快节奏与复杂人际，承受巨大的生活压力与精神压力，稳定安逸的生活似乎触不可及。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是他们又有出世的一面，他们很想逃离这一切，不去理会什么房子、车子、孩子、职场，想辟出一块属于自己的精神家园，屏蔽外界的一切纷纷扰扰；但真的要放下这一切，他们又会有所眷恋，有所不甘。中产的撕扯是因为他们无论是出世或入世，均不可得。于是他们时常在二者之间彷徨犹豫，左手是马云，右手是星云。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李健完美出世又完美入世，他活成了许多中产想活成的模样，他就这样成了中产的抚慰者。这样说绝不是贬低李健，李健无意于扮演这样的角色，他只是刚好踩到了时代的节点上——这个时代的中产阶层真是太累了。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;所谓“祖源分析”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;人类遗传主要分为父系、母系、常染色体三个部分。其中父系溯源比较直观，就是查Y染色体，因为其只能从父亲传给儿子；而母系溯源的原理也差不多，就是查线粒体基因。无论男女，线粒体都只能从母亲那里获得。但Y染色体和线粒体，都只占人类基因非常小的一部分。而父母各给一半的常染色体，则占比超过98%，可以说常染色体真正决定了你是谁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各种商业检测所谓的“祖源分析”，也基本都把常染色体作为最大卖点。如果不了解原理，可能就会被误导——所谓的祖源分析，其实是先把全世界各地的主要人群，都抽样测一下存档。然后再用你的检测结果，去和档案里已有的数据比对，看看和哪些人群最接近。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以如果你测出来了“40%的南方汉族，50%的北方汉族，10%的蒙古族”，这并不表示你的100位祖宗里，有40个南方人，50个北方人，10个蒙古人——这个检测结果仅仅表示，你和该公司的北方汉族样本最接近，其次是南方汉族样本，最后是蒙古族样本。把这3个样本按以上比例混合得到的常染色体数据，和你的检测结果接近，仅此而已。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而我们都知道，东亚大陆没有种姓内婚制，南北人群的基因肯定是渐变的。加上各机构取样不同，结果就是同一个人在不同公司往往会测出不同结果：比如有的机构取山西汉族为“北方汉族样本”，于是山西汉族去测，就会测出来“100%北方汉族”；而有的公司以华北汉族为北方样本，山西汉族去测，又可能测出来“蒙古血统”了......&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以从本质上来说，这不是“祖源分析”，而是“亲戚分析”。但你和某个人群接近，就必定有共同祖先，所以虽然是商业噱头，但也不算凭空捏造，还是有其科学依据的。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;满族基因与汉族无异&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“我从哪里来”是全世界人类都感兴趣的哲学问题，基因检测这么火也是自然之中了。为了吸引顾客，各大基因公司也纷纷完善样本数据库，希望能给所有族群都筛选出没有争议的比对样本——然而这个宏大计划，却在满族基因上碰了一鼻子灰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一个人口上千万的民族，各大机构对满族反复取样计算，却发现始终无法得到满族的标杆样本。无论怎么扩大样本量，改善分析方法，即使对满族的抽样人数已经达到数千人，却依然是一个结论：满族无论父系、母系、常染色体，都与汉族没有区别。如果用已有标杆样本进行分析，那么现代满族群体的民族血统，以北方汉（80%）、南方汉（6.57%）、日韩（5%）、蒙古-通古斯（3%）等成分为主。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的结果，让很多学者和人类学爱好者都很惊讶：其他通古斯语人群，比如鄂伦春族，和汉族的基因差异是非常明显的。满族在遗传上却和汉族几乎一致，要知道清朝是严禁满汉（旗民）通婚的，那么满族作为通古斯语系的一员，到底是怎么变成汉人血统的？&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;掠奴传统&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;一个可能的解释是，这和满洲（女真）社会的掠奴传统有关。满洲入关前后还处在奴隶社会，每次出征都必定大量掠夺平民作为奴隶，满语称为“阿哈”，如果是家生奴隶就叫“包衣阿哈”。比如明朝成化三年，明军深入打击建州女真，一次战役就解救了1165名沦为女真奴隶的汉人。而随着建州女真的不断崛起，掠奴的规模也越来越大，动辄以万计。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后金/清对明朝掠奴的人数规模，目前国内没有研究。但同时期清朝也对明朝属国“李氏朝鲜”多次用兵，根据史料记载，1636年丙子战争，清军将60万朝鲜官民男女掠为奴隶，押回沈阳市场贩卖（这个数字还不包括清军中的蒙古士兵掠往蒙古的朝鲜人口数）。现代学者大多认为60万有所夸大，实际数量大概在40万-50万。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在整个明清易代战争中，清军掳掠的汉人恐怕更难以计数了。比如1698年来华的法国传教士巴多明，就在写给法国科学院的信中提到：“年老的鞑靼人在关内渐渐死去，他们的子女更容易学习被征服地的语言而不是父辈的语言，因为他们的母亲和仆人几乎全是汉人”——可见清初的满洲家庭，女眷和仆人都源自掳掠来的汉人奴隶。这样几代之后，其母系和常染色体遗传，必定都会变得和汉人无异，母语也会自然替换成汉语。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;清代战争制度与抱养继嗣&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;然而现代满族的父系遗传，也和汉族相差无几，这就不能只用清军掠夺汉女来解释了。有一种观点推测，这可能和清代独特的战争制度导致的旗人家庭抱养继嗣成风有关：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多历史爱好者都注意到，明代调兵动辄数万数十万，比如万历年间的播州之役，三省各出兵8万，合计24万明军。而清代却只能一次调动数千士兵，最多也不过一两万人。比如乾隆年间的某场边境战争，开战初期居然只派出3000八旗兵和100名侍卫巴图鲁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为清军必须首先防范汉地起义，因此绿营极度碎片化，分散在全国各地。然后在各个关键城市设立满城，调入八旗驻防。通过相对集中的八旗，去监视绿营。如果某个地方出现了民变，可以第一时间出兵弹压。把起义消灭在萌芽状态，同时防止汉人构成的绿营坐大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是这种碎片化的军制，一旦碰到外敌入侵，或是需要组织军队对外进攻，就很难凑出一支规模庞大的军队了。先不说调兵需要极长的时间，为了保证对内的镇压力度，只能抽调小部分兵员。即使花了大力气凑出了一支稍具规模的，这支军队也是各种支离破碎的小部队集合体，缺乏组织度，难以用于打大规模会战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顺治五年编审完成的丁册记载，八旗壮丁共计34.7万人，其中满洲5.5万人，蒙古2.9万人，汉军4.6万人。而满、蒙古旗下家奴汉人21.7万人，占比达62.5%。满蒙汉八旗，共计13万壮丁，是战斗兵的主力。这些清军一半在北京，一半分散各地满城驻防。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此清初八旗每次出兵，抽调1万人都是大兵团了。这样的结果是，满洲士兵在各种战争中被快速消耗，而汉人家奴不参军打仗，即使随军也以承担辅助和后勤工作为主。这部分人口在清初一系列战争中，受到的人口损失应该是最小的。而且家奴算是八旗的私产，如果折损了，旗人还会想办法“补充”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等到雍正年间，清朝在和通泊战役中仅仅损失7000八旗兵，就把京城旗人打得家家披麻戴孝。接下来乾隆又号称“十全武功”，战争愈加频繁，八旗人口的损失来不及通过自然生育填补。很多旗人家庭男丁战死后又亲族凋零，只能偷偷从汉人家奴里抱养孩童为养子以充门户，避免家门绝断，一家女眷无人赡养。民间一直有传说，乾隆抱养自海宁陈氏，其故事原型可能就来源于此。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p>;不仅如此，母亲的两间屋里还囤了很多旧物，不知多少年前的衣服鞋帽，生锈的铁锅铁铲、农具，甚至父亲在世时从新疆带给她的棉毡、毛毯、羊皮袄，破破烂烂，乱七八糟。我们要给她清理出去，母亲宝贝似的护着，生怕我们趁她不注意，给当垃圾丢掉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一些乡村、城镇，有我母亲这种习惯的老人还相当普遍。有的囤得少一些，分门别类摆放；有的囤得多，摆得杂乱无序；还有的垃圾与日常用品相混杂，干脆在垃圾堆里吃睡。据了解，这多为孤寡老人所为，捡来的垃圾能卖出去的很少，因无力再转移出去，久而久之他们就与垃圾共存。还有的老人有儿有女，也爱囤破烂儿，其行为习惯常遭儿女们厌烦，甚至被讥笑为“恋旧狂”“神经病”，劝也劝不住，不胜其扰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些老年人为何爱囤“破烂儿”？究其原因，我通过调查发现，不外乎以下几点：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是基于节俭，不忍丢弃老物件。老年人苦日子过惯了，对家中旧物件能将就用就用，很少添置新衣新用品，即使儿女给买了，也往往不习惯，还是觉得旧的好，舍不得丢弃。对于捡来的破烂儿，有些老人并非为卖钱，而是觉得丢掉可惜。老家村里的王老汉喜欢收年轻人淘汰的旧家具，常见他用三轮车吭哧吭哧往家运。有人问他：“你攒这么多，自己用得了吗？”王老汉说：“都是上好的木料，这在以前上哪儿找呀！我拆解开，还能派上用场。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二是基于怀旧，破烂儿里有温度有感情。不少老人存有恋旧物的心理，很多衣物用品跟随了几十年，旧物有记忆、有故事、有感情。在我家，母亲对堆了两间屋的破烂儿有着深厚的感情，特别是父亲的遗物，安葬时她留下了一部分，每次要给她处理掉，母亲总要絮叨：“你们当垃圾扔了，我到哪儿去想你爸？我拿出这些物儿，摩挲摩挲，念叨念叨，就像是和他说说话儿……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三是基于孤独，借以排解寂寞。这种情况在爱囤破烂的老人中，更为普遍。听母亲讲，张婶的三个孩子都在发达地区打工，收入不菲，每月都按时给她汇钱来，应该说张婶衣食无忧。可她却起早贪黑，风雨无阻，到处捡垃圾。张婶道出了缘由：“儿女们都知道孝敬，俺什么都不缺，可他们一年到头很少回来，俺心里空落落的。俺捡破烂儿并不全是为着卖钱，就是有事可做，心里踏实。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四是基于被关注，渴望短暂的小幸福。朋友跟我闲聊时，提及他家亲戚、住在城区的李婆婆捡垃圾的原因与众不同。她的老院子平时少有人来，只有过节过年时儿孙们才团聚，欢声笑语溢满了不大的院落，那是李婆婆一年之中最幸福最快乐的几天。后来，李婆婆发现，只要家里乱了，儿女们也会来打扫，于是她灵机一动，故意捡来垃圾，故意把院子搞乱搞脏，这样孩子们就会回来收拾，家里就添了人气生气，热热闹闹的了。两个儿媳看不惯她这种做派，说李婆婆有点精神不正常。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老年人热衷囤积破烂儿，不仅有碍观瞻，影响家庭环境卫生，更主要的是老人的心理健康或多或少出现了问题。作为子女，不仅要经常清理打扫，规劝安慰，使其回归正常的生活轨道，还应从深层次上找原因。常言道：解铃还须系铃人。子女不仅要重视物质方面的赡养，更应注重精神赡养，就像老歌《常回家看看》里所唱的，“找点空闲，找点时间，领着孩子，常回家看看；带上笑容，带上祝愿，陪同爱人，常回家看看……”多给老人精神上的安慰，让他们感受浓浓亲情和家的温暖，某种程度上来说，这比单纯给以丰厚的物质赡养更为重要！&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Kangren has no agent or company. He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before becoming an actor. work. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren&#39;s voice came from the other end of the receiver. Like an old-fashioned man, he carefully confirmed the name of the newspaper and the reporter&#39;s name, and his tone sounded gentle and gentle. He is on vacation. When he is not working, he spends his time in the same way as ordinary people. He passes the time by watching anime such as &quot;Spells Come Back&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, Wu Kangren may have been the actor with the broadest role map in the Chinese-language drama market. His images in movies and TV shows are so varied that it&#39;s jaw-dropping. In 2021, he dressed up in women&#39;s clothing, put on lipstick, and played the role of Mama Sang &quot;Baby&quot; in the highly acclaimed drama &quot;The Lights Are Coming&quot;. The character photo was published in Taiwanese newspapers, but no one reacted, &quot;It took two days to be discovered by others. Isn&#39;t this Wu Kangren!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2022 drama &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, he plays A pervert who is sexually harassed in the workplace has a female fan who is so angry that she wants to &quot;quit her fans&quot;. Wu Kangren is very calm about this. He told Southern Weekend reporters that he is not worried about the loss of fans of the drama and movies. &quot;The next role will be different.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These roles are a huge departure from the &quot;flower boy&quot; image he played early in his career. At the age of 27, he played Hana Takuya in the classic idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; - affectionate, broken, and in line with all the settings of a tragic male lead. But in the following years, he continued to break away from that image full of romantic arcs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, on the 54th Taiwan Golden Bell Awards stage, Wu Kangren took the stage as the award guest. Everyone looked at the thin actor with sunken cheeks and a bald head with some suspicion. &quot;Isn&#39;t this a bald man?&quot; A barrage floated across the video. At that time, for the new drama, he lost weight to only 64 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has become routine for him to adjust his body shape, skin color and accent according to the requirements of the role. Someone made an Excel polyline table of Wu Kangren&#39;s weight data from &quot;Termites&quot; to &quot;Love&quot; and found that his weight suddenly went up and down, showing a steep W shape. A reporter from Southern Weekend asked him if he was not afraid of physical damage caused by drastic changes? He smiled and replied: &quot;I&#39;m still alive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fight&quot; is the key word that many people first think of when they mention Wu Kangren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Wu Kangren changed his appearance again in the Taiwanese drama &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; broadcast exclusively on Station B. He put on a Hawaiian shirt, revealing his dark skin, and became the 41-year-old frustrated middle-aged Gao Jiayue. As the eldest son in his family, he has been drifting away for a long time, running a restaurant named &quot;One Million&quot; with a rating of only 2.8 in Xiaoliuqiu. After several years of bleak business, his girlfriend couldn&#39;t bear the island life and cheated on him and left. His career went bankrupt, his love failed, and he tried to hang himself in a restaurant, but the rope broke. Dive to the bottom of the sea, take off your oxygen equipment, and prepare to drown yourself. He suddenly remembered that the oxygen equipment might be eaten by sea turtles and was not environmentally friendly, so he had no choice but to surface and returned home dejectedly to meet his family and have a &quot;long farewell.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My parents ran a breakfast shop in Taipei to support their three sons. The mother struggled to endure her father&#39;s mental infidelity and continued to live under the same roof with resentment. The second son is an adopted son. He lives a regular life as an office worker and takes the initiative to take over the responsibility of taking care of his parents. The younger son is older and unmarried, and helps in the breakfast shop. The whole family is stuck in the inertia of the old life and is stuck in moving forward. Everyone is in a &quot;stuck moment&quot; in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren said that he doesn’t have much in common with the character, but as a peer of Gao Jiayue, he has also experienced Kaka moments in real life. &quot;What&#39;s the hardest time for an actor? The role you want to take is taken away, or people don&#39;t like your good performance when it comes out.&quot; Wu Kangren told a reporter from Southern Weekend. His response was simple and clear: keep eating, sleeping, and trying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 will be a harvest year for Wu Kangren. Two of his films, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were screened at the film festival. Both films focused on the bottom class. &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was filmed in Malaysia, with Wu Kangren playing a deaf-mute illegal immigrant. After getting off the plane, he intuitively felt the gap between him and the character. At first glance, he was a &quot;white and clean civilized person&quot;, while the character he played lived in a dirty place all day long. He began to starve and continued to bask in the sun until his skin was tanned by ultraviolet rays and the locals in the market stopped looking at him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 First Youth Film Festival, he won the best actor for this role. The organizing committee commented on his performance: &quot;Faced with unconventional character settings, Wu Kangren used all available physical resources such as expressions, body parts, movements, and eyes to perform, interpreting the emotions and emotions of the film extremely vividly. Hearing thunder in silence reflects the actor&#39;s great empathy for the character&#39;s situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren has a rare sense of relaxation. He has no agent or company and works for himself. Lasted nine years. There are no personal restrictions or team control. It&#39;s all up to you to decide what kind of scenes to take on, what roles to play, how much to talk to the media, and what the standards are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asked a Southern Weekend reporter which episode of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; he had watched. After getting the answer, he conveyed his preferences as if he were a friend: &quot;Look further down, the back is really better. I really like it.&quot; I like it.&quot; Faced with the reporter&#39;s &quot;problematic&quot; question, he also bluntly said: &quot;This question is too broad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the outside world, the different types of roles over the years have brought Wu Kangren Emboldened. But he said that when he was young, his sense of self-identity was very low and he felt that he was just a &quot;nobody&quot;. He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before the age of 20. He worked as a rough laborer on construction sites, ran a street stall, and also worked in cafes and bars. Now that I am in my forties this year, the feeling of insecurity has subsided, and new questions have arisen in my heart. He said that in recent years, he feels that his life as an actor will not be too long, so he cherishes it more and increases the frequency of taking roles. This year, he has at least seven film and television works released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the interview, he almost subconsciously revealed his expectations for his subsequent career. He said: &quot;I want to continue acting until I am old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot; In &quot;In This Lifetime&quot;, Wu Kangren plays Gao Jiayue, a frustrated middle-aged man. After his career went bankrupt and his love failed, he tried to commit suicide but failed and returned home in despair. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early October 2023, Wu Kangren accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. The following is a self-narration compiled based on the interview content:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;It would be good to grow this big in my lifetime&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After receiving the invitation from &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; At that time, I had just finished filming the movie &quot;May You Live Longer&quot; in Hong Kong. When I finished filming, I only weighed 53 kilograms, which was too light. So before joining the set of &quot;In This Life Time&quot;, I ate as much as possible and weighed 66 kilograms when I returned. Last year I went to Malaysia and Hong Kong to shoot a movie respectively. I was made thin and dark. I came back to play the role of Gao Jiayue, a kid who came back from the island. In fact, he looked quite similar. In addition, director Xu Zhaoren is here, and I also like the script. I knew beforehand that Brother Xixiang (Xi Xiang, who plays the father) and Sister Guimei (Yang Guimei, who plays the mother) would take the role, so I also wanted to act together in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director took the sad story very lightly, and made the sad things somewhat funny, even humorous. Gao Jiayue is a person who really wants to die. But if you take what Gao Jiayue said to his nephew, &quot;I jumped into the sea, I wanted to die, but I saw turtles again, and I was afraid that the turtles would eat my equipment and it was not environmentally friendly.&quot; People say that he must think you are lying or joking. But when the audience actually saw the picture, all this became no longer such a joke: it was true, he wanted to die. I think this is where life is ridiculous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In My Lifetime&quot; is not about university knowledge. My own interpretation is, &quot;It would be good to grow this big in your lifetime.&quot; This sentence reflects a lot of feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When things don’t go as planned, it’s always a “stuck moment.” In our lives, sometimes things go against our expectations, and sometimes hard work may not necessarily pay off. This is a very cruel thing. You can’t get what you want, and you can get what you don’t want. How you can stabilize your mood, continue to live, continue to love the people around you, or make the people you love live happily is all a matter of subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people choose to escape, such as the parents in the play who have marital problems. Gao Jiayue came back to tell them not to continue evading. Some people tried to persuade them to make peace but not to leave. Gao Jiayue tried to persuade them to leave but not to make peace. Some people are always in his comfort zone, such as his two younger brothers, who complain about life but are unwilling to step out. How can a character like Gao Jiayue push them, but in such an annoying way? He has the courage to be hated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Real-life family dramas are not as easy as genre dramas. It is very difficult to act in a very real-life way. We actors have been acting for so long and are very familiar with rhythm, technique, and movement. We are also very familiar with how to perform well on camera. But when we try too hard to show the good side, the sense of drama will be stronger and the audience can see it. Xu Zhaoren hopes to adapt it to life, so we revised the lines in the direction of life. Chatting with the director and imagining the characters every day before going on stage is actually very brain-burning and tiring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is very well structured, and the relationship between everyone is clearly written. But we didn’t act according to the relationship between everyone in the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We feel that we have put a lot of effort into it. In fact, at that time, I was so thin that I deliberately imitated Brother Xixiang. Since I wanted to play his son, did I have any similarities with him? We looked at his posture and sometimes imitated him in jumping and sitting. At that time, I had a lot of discussions with the director. Since you want to play a son and a brother, do you have the same attitude towards each family member, or is it a little different? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when you are getting along with your younger brother, you just love to bully him. How to bully him? The screenwriter will not teach you to hit them with your hands in the play. This kind of action must be designed by yourself. And it has to be connected to when you were a kid. The second brother in the play is not your biological brother. Your attitude towards your biological brother (reporter&#39;s note: third brother) may be different from that of the second brother. In fact, it is very subtle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the relationship with his father was not good in the script, but in fact when we acted it out, Brother Xixiang felt that he loved his eldest son the most because he was his first son. Child. It is a very straightforward way for parents to express their love for you verbally. Brother Xixiang’s method is the kind of love in which he scolds you the harshest and hits you the hardest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original way of quarreling with my father was to talk to each other, but now as the show continues, it has become that I can actually have a good chat with my father. You are a rebellious son, but you are always unwilling to take what adults say seriously, which means we are acting the other way around. So in the first episode at the beginning, the father guarded the drunk Gao Jiayue from getting up, saying that he was afraid that you would spit it out and choke to death. Therefore, the relationship between Gao Jiayue and his father was not a quarrel at the beginning, but a show of weakness, that is, I was homesick and came back to see it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the script, there is no drinking in the scene of returning home. We discussed with the director and couldn&#39;t imagine what kind of state Gao Jiayue was in before he dared to step into this home again. A failed person, a person who is unwilling to start over, a person who dares not face himself again, but is so arrogant and thinks that I will succeed when I go out to start a business, and then returns to this home penniless, at this time, what should I do? How to do it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what I thought of was, otherwise we would have a drink, and he would have to get himself drunk before he dared to return to this house shamelessly. In the end we decided to use this method. How on earth would he face the truth? You can only get yourself drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that scene, I really drank sorghum wine. I&#39;m not that good at drinking, but I drank in a situation that I could control. After filming, I fell asleep, and the actors called it a day, leaving me alone on set. When I woke up, the only thing left was the lighting crew taking out the lights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In recent years, Wu Kangren&#39;s film and television image has been very varied, and he has played many impressive supporting roles. In 2023, he will have at least seven film and television works released. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;At that time, I only wanted to take supporting roles&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;In recent years, Taiwanese dramas have become more varied in genre. Since they are so varied, of course actors have the opportunity to be varied. They just complement each other, from early idol dramas to later craftsman dramas, police and gangster movies, ghost movies, and now back to life. It&#39;s a big test for actors. You can&#39;t use your past skills to perform every play. When you encounter different plays, you have to make different adjustments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have no particular pursuit to play various types of characters, I just want to accumulate different acting experiences. It should be said that I think the life of an actor will not be too long. I dare not say that for everyone. I think it is a question mark in my mind how long an actor can act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was in my early 30s, I began to realize this, which may have something to do with my upbringing. In the past, my self-identity was not so high. The so-called self-identity refers to self-confidence and even the value of existence. You may feel that you are just a nobody, a child who grew up on a construction site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I really felt that I could only work hard, otherwise what would I do? That’s why I got so many roles later. The reason I take on so many roles is not because I want to make a lot of money. In Taiwan, I can’t make much money from film remuneration. I hope that within a limited time, I can see my own possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after I turned 35, I started to play different roles quite quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She and Her Her&quot;, &quot;The Lights Come on&quot; and &quot;Mom, stop making trouble!&quot; ” were probably all filmed at the same time, and during that time I only wanted to take on supporting roles. Because I think the burden of the protagonist is too heavy. The protagonist sometimes shoots for three or four months at a time. He is always immersed in a role or a long period of work. He is very tired and easily tired. I might as well play a supporting role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the epidemic was also going on at that time, I felt that filming supporting roles could be more fun and not be so stressful. You may say it&#39;s good to have more fun, but I have also reviewed it myself and found that those characters were really overplayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Her and Her Her&quot; was a guest appearance to help, and I didn&#39;t think too much about it, because the role had to be played in a perverted way. I remember that the producer and director couldn&#39;t find anyone at that time, so they called me later. I had some friendship with the producer, so I went to help. I didn&#39;t want to attract everyone&#39;s attention, I just went to serve, serve. That role. I&#39;m not worried about losing the audience. The next role will be different. I&#39;ve never worried about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The First Light&quot; is another story. It was really because of good luck. I had a good role as the &quot;baby&quot; and he had a lot of space. He found me only after the filming started. I was free at that time and even Director Yi Qi asked you to act, and I said yes. I said you have to give me time to prepare, because I need to find a teacher to practice high heels and dance. In fact, we prepared everything in private, chatting with those drag queens, eating and drinking with them, and imitating their looks and voices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So sometimes taking a role is not so calculated, sometimes it’s just a feeling, because the director is right, I go because the script is right, I go because there are certain actors, or I feel that If it helps this drama, I will do it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;When you are not acting, you are just a nobody&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;In This Lifetime&quot; has helped me a lot in my life. I&#39;m really lucky to be able to film &quot;In This Life Time&quot; at this age. Xu Zhaoren is a very good director, and it is very difficult to perform his scenes well. It was the third time I worked with him that this time I seriously felt that I might actually have done a good job. In the past, I didn&#39;t feel like I was able to add points to his dramas, but this drama did a little bit, and I felt like I was finally worthy of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, I take myself very seriously. Sometimes the success of a drama is the result of the team, sometimes it is the credit of the marketing, and sometimes it is the accumulation of credits between the characters. It is absolutely impossible to do it because of one person. Man, this drama is hit or miss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always been confident in my life as an actor. The so-called confidence means that I am willing to do it, not that I am very good. This is a concept. In the past, it was a very simple and clear thing to work hard and be rewarded. This thing has a profound impact on me. If you work, work hard, and sweat for the construction site, you will get the salary you deserve. This is a must-have condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And be responsible. You really have to do your job well, otherwise the boss will scold you, fire you, or ask you to pack up and leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting is the same for me. Sometimes why you are so fat and why you are so thin is because no one has done it, and no one knows what can be gained from it. I want to know what I can gain from the state of mind of being hungry or obese. I think this is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard for you to tell others that I was hungry for 4 months from May to August last year. From &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; to &quot;May I Live Longer&quot;, I lost 53 kilograms. I was so hungry. , how I lived. People just say, wow. But it’s not because my character has to be so thin that you can see how great I am, no. It’s about putting the characters there and seeing the finished product in the end. Even if the movie doesn&#39;t go well, people will think you&#39;re just thin, so what&#39;s the big deal? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because you will really experience it after you do it. We are not like the protagonist of the anime. Why is he almost defeated in the end and still able to wake up? Because he thinks about his family and friends. Like Luffy in &quot;One Piece&quot; and Goku in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, he suddenly doesn&#39;t know where he came from. strength. We are human beings, and we still have our own limits. Limits can only be reached through self-examination again and again. If people don&#39;t make mistakes, they won&#39;t know that they will make mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was acting, I often made mistakes, and I still make them now. It&#39;s just that sometimes someone will correct your mistakes, sometimes not, but I always hope to meet a director who can deny you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of each actor is different. Some talented actors need to retain their energy. I consider myself to be mediocre and I need to accumulate that energy. The growth process of each actor cannot be compared. Since it cannot be compared, there is no repetition. The lack of repetition means that only I understand what I am going through, and you will not understand. Only after each finished product comes out will you see the difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an actor is not acting, you are just a nobody. At most, you will be exposed to fashion or commercial performances, and you will see the glamorous star appearance. In fact, if you take away those appearances, who you really are is very vague. Celebrities have a popular persona, and that persona is the persona that the audience likes, because now everyone likes to see good things, kind people, and even people with high moral standards. The actor&#39;s appearance is very blurry, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with being blurry, it&#39;s just a different experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always felt that actors are people living in the past, and the works you see are all me from the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Acting has never been free&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, I have always felt that my work experience, having worked 50 jobs before I was 20, was not of much help to me. big. The accumulation of work experience is very life-like, but sometimes drama does not require you to perform life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;Copycat&quot;. It is a genre drama, and genre dramas are not life-like. If you want to stick to a life-like performance and conform to the rhythm of the camera and the director, when should you react? This is the pull between you and yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Playing Guo Xiaoqi in &quot;Copycat&quot; was very difficult for me, very difficult, extremely difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The skeleton of the genre drama is better written, but the portrayal of the characters may not be outstanding. Because it serves a crime and captures the real culprit, it takes the audience to see the reaction of each character. After watching it, the protagonist is actually empty. The so-called empty means that you can only accumulate some plots to serve the audience. How to put your own human flavor into it requires a lot of thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, you want to play him very smart, but you don’t want to play him too handsome, a little quirky, but you don’t want to make him too mythical. If you just look at the ferocity of the supporting characters, the main character will easily disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;Copycat&quot; is about using all the things accumulated in the past into one film, &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is about forgetting all the things that I know. This is a transition between very skillful and unskillful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting has never been free. How can acting be free? Acting is very scientific, including lenses, camera positions, performances, types, and even opponents. Acting is very unfree but very organic. Any situation may affect the whole body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called lack of freedom is that you cannot perform exactly the way you want, sometimes because of the orientation of the camera, sometimes because of the rhythm, sometimes because of the opponent actor, and sometimes because of what the character wants to present. situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do you think you have to take on so many roles? Because I think acting is a very passive profession, I just hope to put some of my own initiative into acting work in a passive situation as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The passivity of an actor is to be chosen. You will be there only after the script is written. If the script is not written, you will not exist. You may just act in another play. What space is there to be able to choose and take the initiative? That means to become thinner or fatter, to make the character more internal or more external, it doesn&#39;t matter. No matter what method you use, show your initiative. Those initiatives will affect the director&#39;s thoughts on the character, or the character can have a chemical reaction with other actors. This is the initiative that I think is valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s what acting is, you bring out your own life experience. If you don&#39;t have this life experience, you need to rely on a lot of field research and investment. Except for a few who can&#39;t do it, others can rely on self-study and hard work to accumulate the short one or two seconds on the screen to deceive everyone and say that I look like me. But when you go deeper, whether the performance is good or bad depends on each actor&#39;s own interpretation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, I like many senior actors, such as Mr. Li Xuejian from Mainland China, who can act at that age, or Mr. Jin Shijie, etc. Actors who grew up in Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Tony Leung Ka Fai, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Nick Cheung Ka Fai, and Andy Lau, each actor has accumulated hundreds of dramas, leaving his own place. But for me, that kind of accumulation is very difficult. If I follow the current pace of actors, I will never be able to achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Nine years without an agent&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I haven’t had an agent for about nine years. In the early years, I was still looking for one, but because of one job after another Come, I will keep acting. If there is a job, I will take it, if I get it, I will act, and if I act, I will go on stage. If someone says hello, I will applaud. I will say thank you, and I will keep acting like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After four or five years, it seems that people (agents) no longer come to me. They seem to think that I can do this. But in fact, I am very busy and have many things to deal with, including contracts and work. Time, schedule. I haven&#39;t taken on so many commercial projects, and shooting commercials isn&#39;t too complicated. Relatively speaking, my acting life is pretty simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, I feel that every decision I made before was good. I did not sign for a big company, but signed for a small company, and I will live a happier life. Later, he left the protection of his original agent, and finally became an agent by himself for no apparent reason. I also have to be an assistant and carry my own bag, which contains travel supplies and stomach medicine. Be your own driver and drive to the scene, finish work by yourself, and borrow clothes by yourself. There are things to do and things not to do. There are some jobs that you can choose, and there are some jobs where you don’t have to make this money. If you don’t make this money, you won’t have so many burdens and baggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am an actor, and what we talk about is what actors do. In fact, I rarely talk about conditions, because if you talk about conditions, it will be complicated and waste a lot of thought. Being able to act well is the first condition. I&#39;m not a person who likes to compare. I don&#39;t compare myself to actors of the same age and tell them what they are like. If you don&#39;t think about it, nothing will happen. If you think about it, something will happen. You feel you are at a disadvantage because you have a value standard and judgment: my salary must be so high, or my conditions must be so high. If you don&#39;t have this value standard, there is no such thing as suffering a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, last year&#39;s &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were both very low-cost movies, so why were they filmed? Because I like the script of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, I want to try to go out and experience life. Different environments will have different sparks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did go, it was very worthwhile, and I made a great movie. &quot;May I Live Longer&quot; is from Hong Kong, so it&#39;s the same. I just read the script and said I would go. I didn’t talk about where I would live, and I didn’t even talk about my salary. The producer was surprised and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you ask about the price?&quot; I said I don’t need to ask about the price, just call the contract. He called over the contract and it was this price. I laughed. I know they don&#39;t have money. If I think I can accept it, I will go, and I will be very happy in my heart, and you will be very relaxed, because you have nothing to ask for, so you will go, just asking for a good performance in the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2015 to now, I don’t want everyone to think that because my life has become easier, I am not willing to make progress. I also hope to accumulate something. At least the stuff coming out this year is above the level, and I don’t want to deal with the performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard to say fate. It’s unlikely that you will have a breakthrough in every drama, really. This is a market. To survive in this market, we can only rely on each drama and how to play the role well after joining. In fact, there is not much that actors can do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[清远一所学校七百多名新生退学，官方回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259407]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 18:48:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School’s blind expansion of enrollment in the fall semester of 2023 without approval and replacement with online courses In the case of face-to-face teaching, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau has set up a city and county joint working group to station in the school, ordering the school to actively respond to the concerns of students and parents, conscientiously rectify problems, effectively safeguard students&#39; legitimate rights and interests, and ensure normal education and teaching order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School is a private secondary vocational school with 3,981 students currently enrolled (including: 1,215 in the 2021 grade, 837 in the 2022 grade, and 1,929 in the 2023 grade). After a preliminary investigation, it was found that the school expanded its enrollment without authorization, resulting in insufficient teaching staff and an inability to meet teaching needs, resulting in online classes replacing face-to-face classes. After supervision by the working group, the new teachers recruited by the school for the autumn semester have been gradually put in place, which basically meets the teaching needs. The online teaching problems have been rectified and the education and teaching order is normal. At present, the school has fully refunded the fees to 730 students who dropped out. The Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau guided the school to handle the registration and filing of student status for the 2023 freshmen in accordance with regulations, and urged the school to strengthen teacher training and management to ensure teaching quality. At the same time, in order to ensure that students can transfer to other schools in a timely manner, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau provides information on secondary vocational (technical) schools with surplus places in the city for students who have dropped out to apply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next step, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau will urge the school to speed up the implementation of rectifications and run the school in accordance with the law and regulations. At the same time, an investigation will be launched into the school’s illegal enrollment expansion in the fall semester of 2023 and will be dealt with seriously in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 26, 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2024国考大数据：先考公，还是先考研？丨一图读懂]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259400]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https:// nfcms-cos02.infzm.com/__asset/e4daf879f3/24c0231f40.jpg?t=1698290703661&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[1840年以来的中国与美国（下）丨倬彼云汉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259266]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/1O6gFp3jfetG9KS1ecdoaHUmtMhhrC1Xfl5P4qmW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/1O6gFp3jfetG9KS1ecdoaHUmtMhhrC1 Xfl5P4qmW. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255337&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The expansion of the United States in Asia and the Middle East&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The impact of the two Vietnam Wars on the United States was actually greater than that of the Korean War Even bigger. The United States lost about 4.5 million soldiers in the Korean War, which was unprecedented in American history; and the United States did not get any benefits from the two Vietnam Wars. The two Vietnam Wars lasted for almost thirty years together. It lasted for a long time, especially the second time the United States retreated from Vietnam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poison gas is not used in war. This is an international convention. During World War II, this principle was observed between the United States and Germany and between the United States and Japan. However, the Japanese often used poison gas on the Chinese battlefield. The United States also used poison gas during the Vietnam War. Today, among Vietnamese children, there are deformed and dystocia babies. The poison gas that the United States spread in the forests of Vietnam is still permeating the air. This is all evil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;587&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255338&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Soviet control Within the scope, some countries in Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe made several attempts to break away from the Soviet bloc. Every time this happened, the CIA was deeply involved, causing turmoil. Some of the consequences were national restructuring and the emergence of new regimes, but the only regimes that could maintain stability were the Hungarian Spring and the Polish Spring (the Poznan Incident in June 1956 and the Hungarian Incident in October 1956). In addition, the &quot;color revolutions&quot; in a string of Muslim countries on the Mediterranean coast in the Middle East, such as Egypt, Algeria, and Libya, have always destroyed the original order; and the economic construction that those countries had started has almost stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a geopolitical perspective, the Middle East is a battleground, and this region is also the largest oil-producing area in the world. The United States has tried its best to control it, starting with controlling Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia was an independent emirate that the British separated from the Persian Empire. Later, it became a &quot;wealthy rich man&quot; with a hereditary chief, but it became the &quot;beloved baby&quot; of the United States - for their bases and oil resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1948, when the Jews returned to their homeland, they actually carved out a piece of land next to Jerusalem to rebuild Israel - could the exiled Jews alone have such power? In fact, it was the UK and the US that were behind it. Britain was in ruins after the war, and Israel&#39;s main supporter was the United States. This country has its admirable features. It &quot;made something out of nothing&quot; and quickly built the country into a decent one. The level of Hebrew University is no less than the top universities in China and no less than the top universities in the United States. Taiwan&#39;s military research institute often asks Israeli consultants to help solve missile problems and also asks them to help solve problems of building nuclear power plants. These people are top experts. I have been to Israel several times and the people are very disciplined, live a simple life and are hardworking. But over the past few decades, Israel&#39;s courage and mentality to try and learn when it built the communes have been lost. However, the United States must defend Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States has deeply intervened in Middle East politics and launched three wars: the Gulf War/Kuwait War, the Iraq War, and the Afghanistan War. Then right after that, came the Iran War. Only recently did the U.S. military retreat from Afghanistan in disgrace. At the end of every war, there are ruins and ruins, and the place is completely destroyed. More than thirty years of war by the United States have devastated the Middle East. Countries on the southern coast of the Mediterranean and the northern coast of Africa have not recovered their strength to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the consequences of the extension of the &quot;containment policy&quot; - the United States is addicted to expansion, and every president has a group of generals who want to expand. Blackwater International, which has close ties with those in power in the United States, specializes in the mercenary business. They have killed thousands of people and destroyed countries one after another. They are not responsible.中东的阿联酋也是美国主导下的产物：将这一带几个小酋长联合在一起，建立“联合酋长国”——那里有全世界最奢侈的酒店，停靠着世界上最豪华的游轮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，战后的日本，相当于美国的“殖民地”。在朝鲜战争中，日本为美国提供后勤补给、维修保障，也借机将二战时的老旧设备全盘更新。 1970年代，日本的工业辉煌一时，其生产率全世界最高。世界上日本商货遍地，丰田汽车、松下电器、西田百货，等等——日本商人所在之处，当地房价能翻两三倍。东亚一带的经济，也随着日本起来了，所谓“雁行理论”——中国大陆沿海地带，也在这一波经济荣景之中占了一角。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此情形，美国不能接受：“我将你扶植起来，现在你反而骑到我头上，将我的买卖都抢占了。”于是收紧银根、提高关税、专利索赔等手段齐施，三年之内将日本打到地下，到今天还没爬起来。所有著名的日本品牌，美国公司都占有股份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;台湾比日本聪明，当年的建设不用美国的品牌，像台湾集成电路制造股份有限公司这种企业，都是自己申请专利权——台积电生产了全世界80%的芯片。当初设计台湾经济模式时，就考虑到日本的前车之鉴。台湾的长荣海运公司，是世界上最大的航运公司之一。希腊的大船队现在被美国“卡脖子”了，挪威的大船队美国卡不住。所以，这个“龙头”不讲江湖义气。中国江湖上的龙头老大，是老大吃亏、小弟兄占便宜。美国这个老大是：“你做了我的小弟兄，就得听我的，随我处置。”如此行径，怎不令人失望？最近美国在提高中国的关税，又以台湾问题要挟大陆。从东方到西方，美国的如此行为，使得其领导的国际圈内怨声载道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“美人迟暮”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;数十年来，我们也见过美国曾经的荣景，百年繁华。 1957年我到美国，正好在报纸上读到：一个非裔小学生要进入白人学校而被挡住了；国家动员了该州的自卫队，以政府的力量，将民众的反抗压下去。这种“黑白”之间的纠纷，至今没有停歇过。因为黑人群体仍旧陷落于社会底层，即使金（Martin Luther King, Jr）作了多大努力，也于事无补——种族纠纷问题，如今变成“种族惰性”，弱势种族不再争自己的权利，反而去争政府的失业津贴。从数字上看，美国缺工120万，失业人口只有25万，差不多100万人在领政府的失业津贴，不愿意出去工作。生之者寡，食之者众，经济就走下坡路了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国科技迅速发展，今天的数字化、自动化、人工智能到此地步，厂房里面不见下层工人，只见工程师、检查员。 1970年，我从台湾到匹兹堡大学教书。当时一次大罢工，白宫震动，全国不知道怎么办。今天如果再有同样的事情发生，是否能同样撼动国家？一个国家假如有四分之一的人口，实质上是靠国家“社福基金”养活的，政府税收不够用时，只能靠印钞解决。支撑美金实质的力量，应当是国际贸易和国内的所得税——但实际上却是一团乱账。很多美国公司，收入在别处，富余的钱存在国际户头。如今美国的经济摇摇晃晃，所有货币发行限额等经济学上的定律，都不遵守。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从1980到2008年，两次巨大经济危机，都是信用问题、贪污问题、虚假抵押等问题所致。原本，这都是资本主义制度不容许发生的问题，因为健康的资本主义市场经济，是靠信用承诺。两次经济危机几乎让美国经济崩溃。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SnXMoQYx0RoIF2HMbbwDZ0Den6Mxw13zZapINkNc.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;最近的美国经济，本该是大恐慌、大不景气的时候，居然出现物价回涨、股价回涨的情形——我们都看得出，其中有假。如此情形说明，美国这个国家在自我欺骗。但国内有如此多弱势群体在依靠国家的津贴生活，长此以往，怎么办？这些弱势群体，拥护不讲理的激烈右派，该怎么办？罗斯福当年倡导的“四大自由”很对，但现在“第五个自由”出现了：“别惹我”的自由。要不要工作、是否上学，等等，大家都认为是个人的事——如此“独立精神”，不是健康的独立精神。我希望中国的年轻人不要“躺平”——但是，世界的潮流似乎在这样发展，怎不令人担忧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十几年前，我写了一篇有关美国社会反思的文章，后来发展为一本书：《美国六十年沧桑：一个华人的见闻》。那时候，我批判美国将要面临的危机：政府官僚化、社会涣散、铺张浪费——尤其浪费在军事、国防上。然而，政府该做的事情却并没有尽到责任：全国的硬件设施，桥梁、机场、公路、水泵很多坏掉了，却没人管。当前美国社会，最重要的问题是国家精神涣散：政府天天在争吵的，是堕胎是否合法、变性人的权利，等等——不是说这些问题不重要，而是说这些话题占据了大家的注意力，沦为政客哗众取宠的项目，真正关乎国计民生的事情反而没人管。这个国家正在掏空自己的精神文化、经济实力，这个国家正在走向浪费、走向懒惰、走向消耗、走向空洞化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“9·11”以后，美国以报复恐怖分子为口号，在中东介入无数纠纷。为了惩罚他们，美国在外战上消耗有多大？得到的丑恶名声有多少？国家多少的实力花在杀人上面？花在雇佣枪手上面？花在一架架无人机上面？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;历史上最骄奢的罗马帝国、最浪费的法王路易十四、最野蛮的俄国沙皇，他们的骄奢、浪费，都没有美国如此严重。假如美国经济这条大船沉没，像我们住在美国的人会跟着被淹死，全世界经济会随之没顶。如此危机，该如何挽回，这是令人彻夜难眠，也想不到出路的问题。但是美国如此败象，确实已经很难弥补。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年来，有很多批评美国资本主义的书，但对于这些批评声音，美国的政客不愿意听，或者来不及听——对于他们，最要紧的是如何抓到选票，入主白宫。当年我开始写《美国六十年沧桑：一个华人的见闻》时，至少有十二本书和大量批判美国的文章可用——今天我去查，这些自我批判的书没有了。可是，有识之士还是在批判，《纽约时报》《大西洋月刊》《星期六评论》，少数的几个记者和评论家，不断提醒：危机就要到了。 “火马上要烧起来了”，可没人注意。这件事令我不但感觉心酸，而且心伤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也劝告国内的“唯美派”，不要唯“美”是尚。 “美人迟暮”，会影响世界各处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾看见美国人奋发努力的时候，看见美国民主运作是许多人努力的累积，看见美国对穷国、小国的援助，甚至于教会在各地对当地教众的支持和教育，都是令我钦佩的。而且，我曾经盼望美国的政治体制，有不断的进步和因时的修改。因此，今天看见美国社会的涣散、政治的庸俗，在国际关系上又如此地骄横而不知点检，大家可以想象，美国这个社会，从记忆中的美好形象，居然一变而为现实中破碎的残镜，我的心情不言而喻。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;首先，广州地铁公司在进站处设置安检并要求乘车人如携带液体需通过液体检测仪或“试喝一口”等方式进行检测，是其作为城市轨道交通经营单位所应当履行的安全保障义务，因此安检人员要求张某对其携带的液体进行检测，并不存在过错。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，张某就其主张的医疗费、误工费、营养费、精神损失费等未能提供证据予以证明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张某提供的检查报告单、门诊病历等证据也表明，其早在2020年底至2022年初期间就已被诊断患有肠胃疾病并多次检查就医，亦早在2020年就有失眠症状被诊断有睡眠障碍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此张某无法证明地铁安检要求其“试喝一口”自带水的行为与其主张的损害具有因果关系，张某主张广州地铁公司对其侵权，应承担赔偿责任的诉请，缺乏事实和法律依据，法院不予支持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广州铁路运输法院承办法官表示，安检是地铁公司履行安全保障义务的必要手段，乘客应尽可能支持和配合。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;民法典明确规定地铁站、火车站、机场等场所的经营管理者，未尽到安全保障义务，造成他人损害的，应承担侵权责任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;交通运输部公布的《城市轨道交通运营管理规定》也明确规定禁止乘客携带有毒、有害、易燃、易爆、放射性、腐蚀性以及其他可能危及人身和财产安全的危险物品进站、乘车。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在交通工具上发生恶性事件，空间非常有限，难以及时疏散降低伤害，所以安检作为公共交通工具经营管理者能够采取的可能是最有效果的预防手段，具有合理性、必要性，乘客应当尽可能理解并配合。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;主张侵权，应当证明加害行为与损害结果间存在因果关系。一般的侵权行为，必须具备加害行为、损害结果、加害行为与损害结果之间具有因果关系、行为人主观上存在过错。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本案张某主张因安检行为导致其身体不适，精神遭受刺激，但现有证据只能证明此前其已经患有疾病和失眠，而不能证明此次安检行为后其身体受伤或疾病加重，因此张某主张地铁公司侵权并予以赔偿的诉讼请求没有事实和法律依据。 &lt;/p>;
