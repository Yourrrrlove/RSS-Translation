Why use decimals? Because three of them were stolen and she took them back by herself, each time was only counted as half, which means it was actually 49 times. It&#39;s jaw-dropping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My relatives and friends in China studied and worked in Paris in the mid-1990s. After retiring, I visited Europe again and felt that France had changed a lot in the past 30 years: the urban appearance and infrastructure of Paris had not changed much, and there were still antique and cultural relics buildings that were hundreds of years old. However, the composition of residents has undergone great changes, and the social atmosphere and cultural customs are completely different from those 30 years ago. The personal experiences of relatives, friends and female internet celebrities are quite similar: with the increase in immigration, France&#39;s security has significantly deteriorated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason for the high immigration crime rate: France has many immigrants from Africa. Due to different religious beliefs, cultural traditions, and customs, these immigrants and their descendants have educational disadvantages that affect their social status and economic status. The status is at a lower level. The desire for a wealthy material life like Europe, but difficulty in supporting it financially, will of course lead to an increase in illegal and criminal behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The large influx of immigrants and illegal immigrants into France is a reverse sequelae of &quot;colonialism&quot;. It can be said that France is being reverse colonized. From the 17th to the early 20th century, France occupied a large number of colonies in Africa and became the world&#39;s second largest colonial empire after Britain. The two world wars caused huge losses in France&#39;s population. In order to make up for the shortage of soldiers, France recruited hundreds of thousands of local young people from colonial French Africa to join the French army and fight against Germany. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the war, a large number of colonial soldiers stayed in France and became early immigrants. The French movie &quot;Indigènes&quot; has a vivid description. Many black soldiers asked: We fought for France, why can&#39;t we stay here? The French government and people were speechless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through these early immigrants, their relatives and friends in Africa learned about the development and wealth of France, and a large number of subsequent immigrants and illegal immigrants continued to pour in. Official data: There are currently more than 8 million black people in France. Taking into account illegal immigrants, the actual number may reach 10 million, accounting for 15% of France&#39;s total population of 66 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The changes in the demographic structure have greatly changed France’s traditional religious beliefs, cultural concepts, and living customs, intensified ideological conflicts, and brought about increased crime rates, social unrest, and opposition between ethnic groups and classes. Street demonstrations, vandalism, looting and burning have become commonplace for more than ten years and can be called a wonderful sight in Paris. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turbulent social environment not only affects the economic development of France, but also affects the personal and property safety of everyone living in Paris. In this chaotic environment, it is common to lose a wallet or mobile phone, and with such a high crime rate, it is impossible for the police to investigate and ordinary residents to guard against it. In desperation, they adopted the method of raising the threshold for filing a case: making serious crimes such as robbery a misdemeanor, treating misdemeanors as illegal, and simply ignoring the violations as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States has also learned this trick. In 2014, California passed a bill making theft of less than $1,000 a misdemeanor, which can be compensated through community service. Use this method to avoid conflicts between police and robbers and reduce conflicts between police and black people. This set of legal concepts and judicial practices gave birth to the &quot;zero-yuan purchase&quot; movement in Europe and the United States: large groups of people (mainly immigrants) rushed into stores, took things and ran away. Store owners were unable to stop them and the police were unwilling to intervene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to security issues, there is also a seemingly unrelated change in life details: French bread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When relatives and friends stayed in France in their early years, they were deeply impressed by French dining. I particularly appreciate French bread: in France, bread is not only a diet, but also a culture. In order to make fragrant and delicious bread, French bakers are very particular about dough mixing, ingredients, fermentation and baking. They often start work early in the morning to ensure that fragrant and hot French bread comes out of the oven as the sun rises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he visited Paris again after the COVID-19 epidemic, he was surprised to find that not only had France changed in terms of society and security, but even French bread was different from what it was 30 years ago. It was hard, tired, tasted bad, and had serious crumbs... Later I learned that many ordinary bakers are new immigrants who lack French culture and cooking traditions. For them, bread is no longer a national glory, cultural heritage, It has time-honored customs and exquisite taste in life, but it is just a job, without emotions, and it will not invest too much energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This relative and friend who likes to travel said: Nowadays, it is in former French colonies such as Laos and Vietnam in Southeast Asia, and French bread is made slightly more authentic than in Paris. There are also stricter labor disciplines, certain requirements for employees, and traditional French bread baking techniques are followed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Correspondingly, the French have 150 days off per year (116.5 days per year in most states in the United States), and work an average of 1,490 hours per year (1,791 hours in the United States). Probably because there are too many new immigrants, grassroots jobs are done by immigrants as much as possible. The French natives with higher incomes are living more and more easily and are less and less willing to work. Bakers who once had a considerable social status I am too lazy to pursue my career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is like: instead of carrying out new technological and productivity innovations and trying to reverse the decline, a company that is already in decline cuts working hours, increases wages, weakens performance appraisals, and abandons management... What will be the consequences? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;France&#39;s &quot;traditional loss and cultural ebb&quot; problem is neither limited to social security nor catering. The culture and art that the French were once so proud of, and indeed once reached the world&#39;s pinnacle level, are also facing the same crisis. The former French actor Depardieu entangled a group of French entertainers, scolded Hollywood for engaging in cultural aggression, and even burned the American flag to vent his anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Hollywood did not carry out &quot;cultural aggression&quot; against France through force or unequal treaties, but people (including the French) no longer wanted to consume French movies, dramas, and games. The French should really think about themselves: they have problems in every aspect, including their ideas, ideologies, cultural concepts, artistic creations, international politics, economic and trade relations, social governance, and even baking bread. What is going on? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The deterioration of social security caused by immigration reflects the French government’s failure in social governance. The cultural shock and ideological collision brought about by the immigration issue reflect deeper hidden dangers. The internal cause of France&#39;s social governance failure and cultural ebb is that the spiritual power of contemporary French people has dissipated, traditional values ​​have been abandoned, and national culture has been lost. The French live a lazy, leisurely and happy life, as comfortable as riding a slide, which confirms the old saying &quot;to do good is to climb, to do evil is to fall&quot;. This state of life is worth pondering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, I also hope that everyone will think about what Elon Musk, who is still working hard in middle age, said: I don’t want to use the power of human nature to make money. Just like the interpretation of gravity in &quot;Jupiter Ascending&quot;: Up is hard, Down is easy. Social and personal success require a high-spirited spiritual core. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一座湖南县城“利剑出鞘”：八百公职人员进退公租房]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261401]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the morning of November 14, 2023, a tenant in Runzhong Community moved.

This stems from a centralized rectification campaign to crack down on illegal occupation of public rental housing by public officials. In addition to Runzhong Community, the phenomenon of large-scale relocation has also appeared in Runzeyuan Community, Huimin Community, and Runyuan Community. According to locals, these four communities are public rental housing communities in Lianyuan City, and those who have moved are basically Lianyuan’s public officials and their relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A statistical table obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that 878 households of public employees are living in the above four public rental housing communities, plus 4 households living in public housing units. There are a total of 882 households of public servants, including 28 households with public servants at the rank of full-time clerk and above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many Lianyuan public officials said that those on this list will be vacated before the end of November. &quot;This is also the first time in decades that such a large area of ​​residents has been evicted.&quot; A staff member of the Lianyuan City Housing Security Service Center (hereinafter referred to as the Housing Security Center) told Southern Weekend reporters that this action is in line with the Hunan Provincial Inspection Team Request for rectification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Don&#39;t replace the current rules and regulations with past practices, and you must not compete with the people for benefits.&quot; On October 20, the Secretary of the Lianyuan Municipal Party Committee held a meeting to schedule Public rental housing operation management and service work. &quot;Lianyuan Online&quot; public account announced that the meeting emphasized that public rental housing is affordable housing, and all relevant departments must unify their thinking; a leading group and a special work class must be established to conduct in-depth research, analysis, and identification of existing problems, loopholes, and weaknesses. , establish a list of ledgers by category, and increase rectification efforts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;November 2023, Lianyuan, Hunan, the main entrance of Runzhong Community.

Red banners were hung on many fences and walls to crack down on illegal use and subletting of public rental housing. In the two communities, there are announcements from the Lianyuan City Housing Insurance Center on the front and back of each building: &quot;The municipal party committee and the city government are cleaning up and rectifying the illegal use of public rental housing. Relevant units, organizations and individuals are welcome to report illegal rentals to our center. Once the situation of public rental housing (including the actual occupancy situation by lending, subletting, reselling and other methods) is verified, the unit, organization and individual who reported it will be rewarded 500 yuan/time.&quot; The announcement date is October 31. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There have been fewer people moving in the past two days. Many people have moved away a few days ago.&quot; On the afternoon of November 13, a resident of Runzhong Community told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;Public rental housing, the full name of public rental housing, refers to limited construction standards and rent levels. Affordable housing for rent for urban lower-middle-income families with housing difficulties, newly-employed workers without housing, and migrant workers with stable employment in cities who meet the prescribed conditions. According to the &quot;Measures for the Administration of Public Rental Housing&quot; issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development in 2012, the lease period of public rental housing generally does not exceed 5 years. After the expiration of the period, if the conditions for renewal of the lease are not met, the rental period must be vacated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The origin of the concentrated evacuation of Lianyuan City, according to many public officials, was the arrival of the 11th Inspection Team of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee to work in Lianyuan City 2 During the month (September 7, 2023 - November 7, 2023), some people reported that public officials illegally occupied public rental housing and sublet and resold it, resulting in poor households who really needed a house without a house to live in. &lt;p>; The Notice also mentioned that the 11th Inspection Team of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee issued a handover letter to Lianyuan City on October 17, 2023, reporting that there was a problem in public rental housing in Lianyuan City that public officials competed with the people for profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This notice requires each unit to carefully conduct an investigation into the public rental housing situation of the unit&#39;s staff&amp;nbsp;(including family members), and on October 23, 2023 Submit the &quot;Statistical Form of Public Rental Housing Rented by Public Employees&quot; to the Municipal Housing Insurance Center before 17:00. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Many people brought this matter to the inspection team to report it. The inspection team felt that this was a common problem. According to an investigation, eight to nine hundred households had public officials (residing in public houses). Rent a house).&quot; Lin Min (pseudonym), a staff member of the housing insurance center, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The phenomenon of public officials illegally occupying public rental housing is not an isolated case. Public information shows that in May 2021, an inspection by the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee of Qingchuan County, Guangyuan City, Sichuan Province found that local public officials used 412 public housing units in violation of regulations, including 275 public rental housing units in violation of regulations, involving 145 public officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Further forward, in 2019, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee of Anhua County, Yiyang City, Hunan Province also discovered such a phenomenon. 4 public employees sub-leased public rental housing, 5 public employees sub-leased public rental housing, and 28 public officials did not meet the conditions for renting and did not withdraw in time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to public information from the Lianyuan City Media Center, on the evening of October 25, 2023, members of the 11th Inspection Team of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee met at the Lianyuan Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee It was once again emphasized at the meeting that we must confront the issue of public rental housing, which is a matter of strong public response and concern, and push forward the rectification of the problem steadily and solidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, before the arrival of the inspection team, Lianyuan City also tried to rectify this problem. According to a report by Hunan Daily in early 2023, the Lianyuan City Housing Insurance Center carried out a special clean-up and rectification operation for illegal use of public rental housing by public officials from January 9 to 18. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In January, more than ten households with serious non-compliance of public officials were reported, including those with cars and houses under their names. Then again Some people were replaced, and a few households were finally cleared.&quot; Lin Min said that according to Lianyuan City&#39;s practice, such special clean-ups are organized every two or three years, but the intensity of the clean-ups is relatively small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;How can our housing insurance center have the ability to move out with such great efforts now? If the inspection team hadn&#39;t come and the municipal Party committee secretary personally arranged the move, who would have moved? &quot;According to Lin Min, the rectification of public rental housing involves many cadres, and it is difficult for the municipal housing insurance center to implement it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the afternoon of November 13, 2023, a public employee moved out of Runzhong Community.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zheng Dan&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Too many vacancies, is it a waste? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Are public employees eligible to live in public rental housing? Nie Chen, an associate professor at the School of Public Administration at Beihang University who has long studied housing security, believes that it is normal for some qualified public officials with lower incomes and housing difficulties to live in public rental housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;After the abolition of the welfare housing allocation system in 1998, most provinces and cities across the country no longer &lt;span>;have units built&lt;/span>; to provide housing to employees. It is true that some civil servants have low wages, heavy family burdens, and cannot afford a house, so they meet the conditions for applying for public rental housing.&quot; said Wang Cailiang, director of the China Construction Management and Real Estate Law Research Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But regarding the situation in Lianyuan, a person familiar with the situation told Southern Weekend reporters that most of the public employees who moved into public rental housing were moved in through lottery, and a small number of them moved in through &quot; &quot;Apply the note&quot; to get the accommodation. &quot;Some people buy houses in Loudi, but they don&#39;t have houses in Lianyuan; some people have houses in Lianyuan, but they want this house; and some are helping friends or relatives to approve notes.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The hardest-hit area is Runzhong Community, where most public officials are located. It is close to the city center and has a more convenient location.&quot; The person familiar with the matter said. Southern Weekend reporters compared the public rental list of Runzhong Community’s three computer lottery results with the public rental housing statistics table for public rental housing rented by public officials in Lianyuan City. They found that a total of 1,826 households were occupied in Runzhong Community’s three lottery draws. There were 669 public servants in the community, accounting for 10% of the community’s residents. The total number is about 37%; 522 of them are on the lottery results announcement list, and the remaining 147 households are not on the lottery list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporter also obtained a copy of Lianyuan City&#39;s &quot;Statistical Table of Housing Check-out of Public Rental Housing for Leading Cadres of Zhengke and above&quot;, which shows that many units have 28 cadres at the department level have checked out at the end of October 2023, and the furniture is still being cleaned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Why are there such a large number of public officials living in Runzhong Community? The above-mentioned insider revealed that after the completion of Runzhong Community, during the public lottery in 2017 and 2018, due to some special reasons, &quot;as long as you participate in the lottery, you can get a house.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Runzhong Community built more than 2,300 houses at one time, but no one lives in them, but it requires an occupancy rate of 90%. If the housing insurance center cannot complete it, it will Being criticized. Because you have to build so many houses, it must mean that there is such a huge demand.&quot; The person familiar with the matter said that when allocating rents, the housing security department reported the low occupancy rate to the Lianyuan Municipal Government, and then the Lianyuan Municipal Government A meeting was held to discuss relaxing the conditions, and public officials who do not have housing in Lianyuan can apply for the lottery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 24, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend called the relevant person in charge of the Lianyuan City Housing Insurance Center to verify this statement. The other party said that it was &quot;not needed&quot;. declined to be interviewed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another staff member of the Lianyuan City Housing Insurance Center told Southern Weekend reporters that Runzhong Community is located in Jianzhong Village and Hujia Village, Lantian Street, and construction started at the end of 2012. Construction, including low-rent housing and public rental housing, was called the &quot;Under Construction Low-rent Housing and Chengdong Public Rental Housing Project&quot; at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Information from the official website of the Lianyuan Municipal Government in 2013 shows that the Jianzhong low-rent housing and Chengdong public rental housing projects are Lianyuan City’s “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” housing security One of the key affordable housing construction projects implemented within the plan. The project covers an area of ​​188 acres, with a total planned construction area of ​​140,000 square meters, a total investment of 180 million yuan, and a total of 2,076 housing units planned to be built. After completion, it will become the largest housing area, the most complete functions, and the most livable environment in Lianyuan City. A good residential community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A property bidding document for Runzhong Community in 2021 mentioned that the total construction area of ​​the housing in the community is 140,000 square meters, with a total of 30 buildings, including 2,218 residential units. 742 non-residential (service buildings). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The panorama of low-rent housing in Jianzhong (top) released by the &quot;Lianyuan Online&quot; public account, the panorama of Runzhong Community published in &quot;Lianyuan Yearbook (2019)&quot; (bottom) .Information picture&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/fc0c1983ba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1223&quot; data- src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/fc0c1983ba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259772&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text -align: center;&quot;>;The panorama of low-rent housing in Jianzhong (top) released by the &quot;Lianyuan Online&quot; public account, and the panorama of Runzhong Community published in &quot;Lianyuan Yearbook (2019)&quot; (bottom). Information map&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Low-rent housing refers to the government providing social housing to families who meet the low living security standards for urban residents and have housing difficulties in the form of rent subsidies or in-kind rent allocation. Social housing. Nie Chen told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In a sense, low-rent housing is public rental housing. It caters to people with lower incomes, and the rent is lower than public rental housing. In 2014, low-rent housing and public rental housing were merged, and now they are basically Called public rental housing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nie Chen analyzed that from 2010 to 2015, the country promoted public rental housing and low-rent housing on a large scale. At that time, it set a goal: to solve 1540 problems by the end of 2012. To solve the housing problem of 10,000 low-income families with housing difficulties, the coverage of affordable housing should reach 20% in 2015. &quot;At that time, various places had goals to achieve and built a large number of public rental housing.&quot; However, during the actual investigation, Nie &lt;span>;Chen&lt;/span>; found that some areas, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Baotou, Inner Mongolia, had a shortage of public rental housing. Due to remoteness or other factors, fewer people apply for rentals, resulting in vacant public rental housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There is a trend now that the conditions for public rental housing are gradually relaxing, and there is even a phenomenon of converting into affordable rental housing, expanding the scope of security.&quot; Nie &lt;span>;Chen&lt;/span>; said that the rent of affordable housing is generally not higher than 90% of the rent of market rental housing of the same quality in the same location. &quot;But it cannot be directly converted into commercial housing because the government has strict control over public rental housing.&quot; &quot;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that in October 2020, the Lianyuan City Discipline Inspection Committee and the Lianyuan City Supervisory Committee notified the Jianzhong Integrity Committee Collusive bidding issues in rental housing construction. In November 2012, Liang Mou, the former deputy director of the Anti-Corruption and Bribery Bureau of the Lianyuan City People&#39;s Procuratorate, and Zhang Mouxian (an active participant in a gangland organization headed by Tan Mouping) worked to obtain low-rent housing and urban housing in Jianzhong, Lianyuan City. For the construction project of the 14th bidding section of the Donggong Rental Community, four companies including Hunan Lianyuan Xiangzhong Engineering Company were contacted to collude in bidding, and finally won the project. The relevant judgment shows that Liang and Zhang Xian made illegal gains of more than 1.29 million yuan from the project. In August 2020, Liang was expelled from the party and dismissed from public office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to Runzhong Community, there are also many public officials in Huimin Community and Runzeyuan Community. A public official in Huimin Community said that Huimin Community has gradually relaxed conditions for public officials because there are too many vacant houses. Many public officials also said that the application conditions for public rental housing complexes in Lianyuan were previously loose, and migrant workers who did not have a house in Lianyuan could participate in the lottery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The salary of public employees is not high, and many of them meet the conditions (lottery).&quot; Lu Ke (pseudonym), a deputy section-level public employee who lives in public rental housing ) said that the permanent urban population of Lianyuan City is less than 300,000, and it is difficult for poor households who have paid social security and do not have a house to live in public rental housing. &quot;We should take care of the low-income population first. If there are still vacancies, the conditions must be relaxed, otherwise it will be a waste of public resources.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Cailiang believes that the lottery, The two check-in methods of approval note treat the Lianyuan case separately. &quot;Public rental housing is affordable housing developed from the past affordable housing. It mainly solves the problem of a large number of working-class people with low incomes who cannot afford market-oriented housing. If such behavior as granting notes still exists, it is an abuse of power. .” For those who meet the application conditions and move in through lottery, temporary withdrawal may be suspected of breach of contract. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In November 2023, banners cracking down on illegal use of public rental housing were posted in Runzeyuan Community in Lianyuan, Hunan.

Nie Chen told Southern Weekend reporters that regulations for the management of public rental housing are generally formulated by local governments based on local economic conditions. However, the state has unified regulations that tenants must meet two conditions: &quot;low income&quot; and &quot;poor housing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lianyuan&#39;s new rules and regulations show: Lianyuan City&#39;s urban subsistence allowance, low-income, and lower-middle-income families with housing difficulties, newly employed workers without housing and those in urban areas Migrant workers with stable employment who meet local public rental housing admission conditions should be included in the scope of public rental housing security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, lower-middle-income urban households with housing difficulties refer to households whose per capita annual disposable income is lower than the per capita disposable income of urban residents in the previous year and whose household savings are low. Households with housing difficulties of 180,000 yuan (including provident fund) and no real estate in cities at the county level and above; newly employed workers without housing refer to workers who have been working for less than 5 years and are employed locally and whose families have no local housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Min analyzed that the limit on per capita annual disposable income of a family and the limit on working less than 5 years are enough to exclude most public officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;More than 20 public employees who have served less than five years have not been given notice of retirement, and the rest are all the same.&quot; Lin Min recalled that the housing security center held an internal meeting According to the requirements of the government, all public employees who have worked for five years will be dismissed. &quot;It is communicated to the top and bottom that all of them should quit first, and those who meet other conditions for moving into public rental housing can then apply for the next round of lottery.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lu Ke also told Southern Weekend reporters that except for a few college graduates who had worked less than 5 years, all the public employees who lived in public rental housing in his unit were vacated. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A grassroots enterprise staff member who was asked to vacate a public rental house because he had worked for more than 5 years wrote in the mailbox on the official website of the Lianyuan Municipal Government: &quot; (I) originally had no relatives or real estate in Lianyuan. I am a low-income person who fully meets the conditions. I cannot compete with the people for benefits. I sincerely ask the leaders to consider people from other places as appropriate and not to apply one-size-fits-all. Grassroots workers are also people.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the new regulations were introduced, were public officials really not competing with the people for benefits by staying in public rental housing? Southern Weekend reporters randomly interviewed two households in Runzhong Community, both of which were non-public servant families. At that time, they applied for public rental housing through regular lottery channels. One of them said that his brother and mother also applied for public rental housing in this way, and had never been unable to apply for public rental housing before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Min believes that later people reported that there was no public rental housing to apply for, which was a new problem in the new stage. &quot;Some people did not need public rental housing at the time, but later their children got married and needed houses again, and some &lt;span>;had family changes.&quot; In addition, in recent years, Lianyuan has no longer New public rental housing. Due to national policy adjustments, in principle, no new public rental housing will be built after 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 8, 2023, the Lianyuan City Housing Insurance Center issued an announcement to accept applications for public rental housing waitlists from that day to November 20. Those who meet the new regulations can apply for public rental housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the afternoon of November 13, 2023, a public employee moved out of Runzhong Community.

Another public official who is engaged in teaching also said that the school held an emergency meeting that morning. &quot;The leader asked us to sign a commitment letter. If we don&#39;t move by the end of the month, we will fail the annual assessment and we will not get any performance pay.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Our unit has more intensive meetings, and they are held on Saturdays and Sundays.&quot; The aforementioned public official from the Urban Management Bureau said that there are 10 or 20 people from the Urban Management Bureau. Reflecting on the demands, &quot;Most of the houses in our unit have been renovated, and there are quite a lot of complaints.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As far as Lin Min knows, among the public employees who live in public rental housing, those who spend the most on decoration spend more than 200,000 yuan. Regarding whether compensation will be provided for decoration, Lin Min said that the public rental housing contract clearly stipulates that &quot;repair and throw away&quot; will not be compensated for decoration. &quot;Because it is not a rough house. The bathroom, kitchen, and lighting fixtures are all installed. Once it meets the delivery standards, you can basically move in. This is a national subsidy to poor households. Your decoration is somewhat contrary to the government&#39;s rental.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, many interviewees told Southern Weekend reporters that the resale of public rental housing in Lianyuan City is relatively common. &quot;I heard that a house of more than 50 square meters can be sold for as high as 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.&quot; Lin Min said that the reason why many people renovate public rental housing and resell it may be due to a deep-rooted local concept. To. “We in Lianyuan have a thought that if the government gave me this house, it means that this house is mine. I never worried that I would not be able to live in this house. I didn’t expect that the inspection team came and asked us to move. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Following this, rents in some Lianyuan areas close to public rental housing have also increased. &quot;The rent for a two-bedroom house on Xingfu Road used to be less than 4,000 yuan a year, but now it has increased to 5,000 yuan.&quot; A public official who lives in Runzhong Community told Southern Weekend reporters that according to public rental housing The price is just over 2,000 yuan a year. Two other public officials who were dismissed also confirmed: &quot;Suddenly more than 800 households moved out, and the supply of (nearby rental housing) must be tight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align : left;&quot;>;On November 14, a Southern Weekend reporter consulted a staff member of the housing insurance center as a &quot;tenant unwilling to check out.&quot; The other party said that if they think they meet the conditions for living in public rental housing, they can submit materials and request re-examination. The application deadline was 12 noon that day, and eighty or ninety households who were unwilling to check out had already submitted materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A public official who submitted materials said that he received a notice on November 18 and still had to vacate. As far as he knows, only one public official who is paralyzed and has family difficulties has passed the review and can continue to rent public rental housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[支原体肺炎是新冠的变异？张文宏等专家解读误区]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261440]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Currently, as winter begins in various places, respiratory diseases have entered a period of high incidence. How should we prevent and treat it? What are the misunderstandings about respiratory diseases? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Healthy China&quot; column of the main station invited Professor Zhang Wenhong of Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Liu Qingquan, President of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University, and Vice President of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University. Three experts, including Tong Zhaohui, director of the Institute of Respiratory Diseases, explained in detail the common misunderstandings about respiratory diseases on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Myth 1: Respiratory viruses are complicated this winter, and superinfection is scary? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhang Wenhong said that many people are afraid of superinfection. In fact, sometimes multiple viruses or bacteria are detected because very sensitive detection methods are used, so don’t worry too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui said that although many pathogens have been detected, it does not mean that every one is pathogenic. The doctor will comprehensively analyze which bacteria are the patient&#39;s pathogenic bacteria based on the patient&#39;s clinical condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Qingquan said that from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, superinfection is a combined disease or comorbidity. &quot;For example, after having a fever for 7 days, it was discovered that it was influenza. About 10 days later, the fever returned, and this time it was mycoplasma. This is actually not a superposition, but a situation of poor maintenance and subsequent illness.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Myth 2 : Mycoplasma pneumonia is a mutation of the new coronavirus? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui said that humans discovered mycoplasma as a microorganism at the beginning of the 20th century, and it was not determined to be a pathogen until the end of the 20th century. The new coronavirus was only known to everyone at the end of 2019, and there is no difference between the two. It doesn&#39;t matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are children particularly susceptible to mycoplasma infection? Tong Zhaohui said that children&#39;s immune systems are not fully developed and their resistance is not as good as adults&#39;, so they are more susceptible to infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Myth 3: Once you have a cold or fever, you need to get an infusion quickly? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui said, &quot;Infusions will heal a cold and fever quickly.&quot; This is actually a misunderstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with influenza, colds and fevers have lower temperatures and milder symptoms, and are often upper respiratory tract symptoms. If you have a fever or cough after catching a cold, just take fever-reducing or cough-relieving medicine at home. Pay attention to getting more rest, drinking more water, and supplementing your nutrition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for influenza, some influenza may cause pneumonia or even severe pneumonia. At this time, you may need to be hospitalized, and the resident doctor will determine whether you need infusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Wenhong also said that infusion is generally limited to hospitalized critically ill patients, or some drugs cannot be taken orally and can only be administered through infusion. For the common cold, oral medications work better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Myth 4: Mycoplasma pneumonia can be cured at home? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui said that in most cases, whether it is a virus or mycoplasma, if it is limited to the upper respiratory tract, most of it can heal on its own, and a small number may develop pneumonia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Wenhong said that generally speaking, mycoplasma pneumonia can be improved by taking some symptomatic drugs at home, but it is necessary to pay attention to whether it develops into a serious condition. For example, if your child&#39;s condition improves after taking medicine, you can observe it at home; if your child still has a high fever after taking antipyretics and is sluggish and unwilling to eat, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Myth 5: Increased exercise and sweating in winter can improve immunity? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Liu Qingquan said that from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, excessive sweating will damage a person’s yang energy. During winter sports, your body will feel slightly warm and you may sweat a little. It&#39;s okay to work up a sweat, but it doesn&#39;t have to be every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Wenhong said that everyone is encouraged to maintain a certain level of exercise. &quot;Even if you are very busy today, it is good to walk 5,000 steps.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Special reminder: Please pay attention to the weather conditions in winter and wear a mask as appropriate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[OpenAI忙宫斗，AI大模型和应用忙上新丨科创要闻]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261415]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-27 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/27/5c1572c356.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 27/5c1572c356.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259782&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-to-late November 2023, OpenAI experienced a constant reversal of personnel turmoil, and Sam Altman was re-appointed as OpenAI CEO It&#39;s over for now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plot is complicated and confusing, and it really attracted enough attention. Can a star company and a star CEO really influence the development process of AI in the human world?

Anthropic claims that the accuracy of Claude2.1 is twice that of Claude2.0, which enhances the ability to understand text content, especially when processing higher-accuracy documents such as legal documents, financial reports, and technical specifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as OpenAI cooperates with Microsoft, Anthropic and Google stand together. In early November 2023, Anthropic announced that it would use Google&#39;s chip Cloud TPU v5e to support its large models and use its cloud computing services. Google promised to invest US$2 billion in it in October 2023, with an initial investment of US$500 million. Dollar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Inflection AI, a company co-founded in March 2023 by Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Google’s DeepMind AI research group, Karén Simonyan, chief scientist of DeepMind AI, and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, in November &lt;a href=&quot;https://inflection.ai/inflection-2&quot;>;&lt;strong>;A new generation of large model Inflection-2&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>; was released on the 22nd, calling it the world’s second-generation large model. Language Model (LLM). Inflection-2 performs FP8 mixed-precision training on 5,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, with approximately 10^25 FLOP computing capabilities. It is in the same training computing category as Google&#39;s PaLM 2 Large model, and has been tested on MMLU, TriviaQA, HellaSwag and GSM8k. In most AI benchmark tests, it is better than PaLM 2, and in some tests it is second only to OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone is benchmarking against OpenAI, and OpenAI is certainly not idle either. On November 6, OpenAI released customizable &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts&quot;>;&lt;strong>;GPTs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>; at its first developer conference , allowing ChatGPT Plus users and OpenAI’s enterprise customers to create customized versions of ChatGPT. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Users do not need to master programming knowledge.

It has the characteristics of difficulty in early diagnosis, low surgical resection rate, and easy recurrence and metastasis after surgery. It is also known as the &quot;King of Cancers&quot; because of its early diagnosis. Symptoms are vague, lack specificity, and are easily overlooked. CT is the most widely used and most sensitive examination method for detecting pancreatic cancer. However, the contrast of plain CT images commonly used in physical examinations and hospitals is low, making it difficult to identify early pancreatic lesions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The research team built a deep learning framework—Pancreatic cancer early detection model PANDA (Pancreatic cancer Detection with AI), which uses AI to amplify and identify subtle pathological features that are difficult to detect with the naked eye in plain CT images; internal Test evaluation shows that PANDA can achieve 90% pancreatic cancer lesion sensitivity and 99.9% lesion specificity in more than 20,000 clinical cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using AI to accelerate the popularization of early cancer screening, early detection and early treatment, the quality of patients’ lives can be guaranteed to the greatest extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Attached are three recent major developments in the field of biomedicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New progress in biomedicine&lt;/h4>; &lt;h5>;Eli Lilly&#39;s weight loss therapy was approved by the US FDA&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;On November 8, Eli Lilly announced that its glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor dual agonist Zepbound (tirzepatide) &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ fda-approves-lillys-zepboundtm-tirzepatide-chronic-weight&quot;>;Approved by the US FDA&lt;/a>; for the treatment of patients with obesity or overweight and weight-related comorbidities (blood pressure, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep disorders apnea or cardiovascular disease) to lose weight and maintain weight stability.

In recent years, news of kindergarten closures has appeared in many places. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the news that &quot;China&#39;s most populous county has closed 50 kindergartens&quot;, the closure of kindergartens has become a directly related factor to the decrease in the birth population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Linquan County, Fuyang City, Anhui Province, with a registered population of 2.293 million in 2022, is known as &quot;the most populous county in China&quot;. In August 2023, the Linquan County Education Bureau issued an announcement that 50 local private kindergartens had ceased operations, accounting for 24.5% of the total number of private kindergartens in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A decrease in the number of births is considered to be the main reason. A set of government public data has been repeatedly mentioned in online communication. Linquan County has 58,243 children in kindergarten in 2023, a decrease of 9.2% from the previous year. This is the fourth consecutive year of decrease. This is consistent with the national trend of decreasing the number of kindergartens and the number of kindergarten students in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, another set of data did not attract attention. In June 2023, the Linquan County Development and Reform Commission stated that in 2022, the county will build, renovate and expand 9 kindergartens, effectively expanding the number of public kindergarten places by 2,070; simultaneously handing over 7 community supporting kindergartens, adding 2,610 places, completing the annual target tasks 103.5%. According to the plan, the county will add 1,890 new public kindergarten places and 2,000 kindergarten places in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22, 2023, the founders of many closed private kindergartens in Linquan said that the main reason for the closure was the impact of local public kindergartens. “Their environment is better and their fees are higher. Cheap&quot;. However, they have not received policy support and their living space has become narrower. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are fewer children and the policies are not supportive&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the 50 private kindergartens that have terminated their operations in Linquan County, 12 private kindergartens have applied to terminate their operations, and the other 38 private kindergartens have no actual enrollment. , school-running behavior, the school-running license has expired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chengdong Street Yifan Kindergarten founded by Chen Min (pseudonym) belongs to the category with expired school license. Yifan Kindergarten was opened in 2006. Chen Min recalled that there were only more than 20 students at that time. It later gradually developed to its peak, with nearly 230 students enrolled around 2017. &quot;It has been running for more than ten years, and it has feelings.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Min said that the direct reason for the closure of Yifan Kindergarten was that the Linquan County Education Bureau interviewed and informed it that the current kindergarten operating standards had been improved, but the hardware facilities and site area of ​​Yifan Kindergarten did not meet the standards. , if it continues to open, enrollment will need to be reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If we are given few places, we will definitely not be able to cover the rent, so there is no need to do it.&quot; Chen Min did some calculations and believed that if we continue to do it, there is a high probability of losing money. The number of students enrolled in Yifan Kindergarten has been declining in recent years, while new public kindergartens continue to be built in the surrounding areas. &quot;Public kindergartens have a good environment and low tuition fees.&quot; Chen Min believes that even if the Education Bureau does not stop it, it will have to take the initiative to close it down in two years. After struggling for several months, Chen Min decided not to apply for a license renewal and shut down. Before the closure, Yifan Kindergarten had three large classes and one middle class, with a total of 110 students and 12 teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The teaching land of Hongyang Kindergarten in Huangling Town is a private house built by the principal himself. The number of students enrolled has always been around 80. &quot;But the number of small classes will be reduced from 2022 summer vacation.&quot; The principal of the kindergarten said that before the closure, they had a total of three classes, with more than 20 students and two teachers in each class. Since the kindergarten&#39;s operating license is about to expire, applying for license renewal and acceptance requires reinvestment to improve the environment and facilities in the park. She does not want to invest anymore and simply closes down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that the gradual closure of private kindergartens is the general trend. &quot;Young people are unwilling to have children, so the state has increased investment in preschool education and supports public kindergartens.&quot; And she can clearly feel that after the development of public kindergartens, it is difficult for private kindergartens to recruit students. When asked whether the kindergarten had received a request from the County Education Bureau to limit enrollment, she said: &quot;How should I put it, you can&#39;t recruit many people even if I ask you to recruit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gaotang Town Kindergarten founded by Yang Hui Jiyangzhuang Kindergarten is one of the 12 private kindergartens that voluntarily applied to terminate its operation. &quot;For various reasons, the funds could not be transferred, so the application was stopped.&quot; Yang Hui believes that the primary reason is that the number of students enrolled is small. In the past, Yangzhuang Kindergarten could enroll thirty or forty children, but in 2022, only 10 children were enrolled in small classes. &quot;It will be less every year, and it will be very few by 2022.&quot; At the same time, the school required &quot;two teachers and one childcare&quot;, that is, each class must be equipped with two teachers and three childcare workers. The income was far lower than the expenditure, and Yang Hui began to go into debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Hui mentioned that another reason is that it is very difficult for private kindergartens to recruit qualified teachers. Yang Hui said that in recent years, more and more kindergarten teachers have been recruited, and all of them have joined public kindergartens, and the supply of kindergarten teachers exceeds the demand. In addition, teachers’ salaries are not high, and young people of appropriate age are more likely to choose to work outside the home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 23, 2023, the Linquan County Education Bureau and the County Party Committee Propaganda Department declined an interview with Southern Weekend reporters. A local official told Southern Weekend reporters that as the number of public kindergartens in Linquan County gradually increased after 2017, the living space of private kindergartens became smaller and smaller. &quot;The impact of population decline is only the beginning of the phenomenon, and it is not the fundamental reason (the closure of private kindergartens).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There will be 45 fewer private kindergartens in 2022&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend Reporter Checking the public data of the local government, it was found that the number of private kindergartens in Linquan County has been decreasing year by year since 2019, and there has been a cliff-like decline for two consecutive years in 2022 and 2023, with a decrease of 45 and 50 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the number of public kindergartens has shown an increasing trend from 2019 to 2021 (data is missing in 2022 and 2023), growing from 160 to 221 in three years, and surpassing the number of private kindergartens in 2020 quantity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned officials said that the increase in the number of public kindergartens is mainly due to central policies. On November 7, 2018, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Several Opinions on Deepening the Reform and Standardized Development of Preschool Education&quot;, which clearly requires provinces with a low proportion of children in public kindergartens to gradually increase the proportion of children in public kindergartens. , in principle, the country will reach 50% by 2020, ensuring that the coverage rate of inclusive kindergartens (the proportion of children in public kindergartens and inclusive private kindergartens) reaches 80%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It is also because of the implementation of this policy that we have been able to obtain funds from above and have continued to expand some public schools in recent years.” The official said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Fuyang Daily&quot; report, as early as the beginning of 2020, the Fuyang Municipal Education Bureau formulated the &quot;Fuyang City Preschool Education Deepening Reform and Standardized Development Plan&quot;, proposing to promote the universal, universal, safe and high-quality development of preschool education. We will vigorously develop public kindergartens and build, renovate and expand more than 50 public kindergartens every year. In principle, each town (street) should have one public kindergarten for every 15,000 or more people. By 2020, the city&#39;s gross kindergarten enrollment rate for the three years of preschool will reach 90%, and the coverage rate of inclusive kindergartens will reach 80%, of which the proportion of children in public kindergartens will in principle reach 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2020, the official WeChat public account of the Propaganda Department of Linquan County Party Committee announced that the county had successfully completed the above-mentioned &quot;985&quot; target tasks for preschool education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;985&quot; goal has further requirements in the &quot;Fuyang City&#39;s &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; Preschool Education Development and Improvement Action Plan&quot;: by 2025, the proportion of children in kindergartens in public kindergartens in the city will reach 70%. %above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that while Linquan County is increasing the proportion of public kindergartens, some places are also building more private kindergartens. On October 18, 2023, the Linquan County Education Bureau issued an announcement stating that the study approved the establishment of three private kindergartens in Tupei Township, Guanmiao Town, and Huangling Town. The three new kindergartens are all non-profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned official said that this is the process of natural replenishment in the market. He mentioned that among the 50 private kindergartens that will be closed in 2023, some were newly registered in 2021 and 2022. &quot;It shows that while private kindergartens have discovered that there is a market, the government is also looking at where there are vacancies to supplement.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;After market elimination&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the closure of the six private kindergartens contacted by Southern Weekend reporters, most of the original students were diverted to surrounding public kindergartens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The village party secretary of Zhangmiao Village in Tubei Township told Southern Weekend reporters that after a kindergarten in the village was closed, students were diverted to public kindergartens in several nearby villages. &quot;Public kindergartens charge cheaper, (in this village) The public kindergarten has enrolled more than 90 students in 2023. In the past, it enrolled only a few students, about 30 or 40 people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A parent interviewed in Qizhuang Community, Xingtang Street, also believes that one of the advantages of public kindergartens is that they are cheap. According to his understanding, there is a public kindergarten equipped with a school bus, and the tuition for a semester is more than 2,000 yuan if lunch is provided. If you go to a private kindergarten, the tuition fee will be 4,000 to 5,000 yuan under the same conditions. However, the national chain private kindergartens are more expensive, with tuition fees You get seven to eight thousand yuan per semester. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his opinion, there are not many local students, but now parents pay more attention to education. Parents, whether in rural areas or county towns, tend to send their children to public kindergartens or kindergartens in farther urban areas. The hardware facilities and teaching staff are better. For example, public kindergartens have larger student activity areas, more teaching aids, picture books, and more interest courses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Most of the local private kindergartens are in private houses. The house built by my family has a small courtyard as a playground, and there is nothing.” The above-mentioned parents believe that most of the local private kindergartens that have been closed down are local private kindergartens. “Basically, those that have been eliminated by the market, those with better student sources and up-to-standard software and hardware will be converted into public ones, and all will be taken over by the government.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Yang Hui, it is a helpless choice for private kindergartens to withdraw from the market. Yangzhuang Kindergarten has been closed for more than three months. His kindergarten building and playground are abandoned and cannot be rented out. &quot;I am exhausted every day, and I have no choice.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reluctantly closing the kindergarten, Yang Hui is working hard to keep his private elementary school. The primary school was founded by his father in 1994 and has a history of nearly 30 years. As a rural primary school, when the surrounding public village primary schools merged and closed down, it still attracted many students to attend due to the quality of its schooling. It was regarded as the &quot;central school&quot; of the surrounding villages. At its peak, the primary school enrolled nearly 600 students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Hui said that the current requirements for running schools in Linquan County have increased. The Education Bureau will give him 18 primary school enrollment places in 2022 and 20 in 2023. The school&#39;s enrollment has now dropped to just over two hundred students. Yang Hui did not dare to close down because the investment in primary schools was greater than that in kindergartens, and the losses caused by closure would be greater. But he had no idea about the way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新内阁成立不到三月，三成员辞职，日本政坛怎么了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261385]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-27 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, three Japanese political affairs officials and deputy ministers have died in explosions.

Facts have also proved that many claims of Kishida Wenxiong have not transformed into very practical policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the Liberal Democratic Party, the President of the Liberal Democratic Party, Moriyama President Moriyama pointed out publicly that high-level resignation is &quot;extremely abnormal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Moriyama leads the Moriyama faction of one of the smaller valves in the Liberal Democratic Party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sun Wenzhu believes that the so-called &quot;abnormal&quot; is not only to maintain the authority of the Liberal Democratic Party, but also a certain kind of euphemistic accusation for the Prime Minister Kishida Wento, so as to put himself on himself. The sent valve was cut with Kishita. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;This incident has further revealed money problems, and style problems have become Japanese political illness.&quot; Sun Wenzhu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Earlier this month, Kishida Cabinet launched an economic stimulus plan of over 17 trillion yen. The main content is tax cuts and extended subsidies. The Japanese government estimates that the plan will increase by 1.2%each year in the next three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But Kishida &quot;Sprinkling money&quot; failed to get the expected goal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On November 15, the Japanese Cabinet Mansion announced the third quarter GDP data. In Japan for the first time, GDP growth was negative. In the third quarter, private consumption in Japan declined, net exports decreased by 0.1%, and corporate investment declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The new economic countermeasures have not been recognized by the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; A poll in Japan shows that more than 60%of the people &quot;do not praise the government&#39;s comprehensive economic countermeasures. The reason is that since 2020, Japanese income tax and residents&#39; tax have increased year after year. Today&#39;s economic policy formulated by Kishida Cabinet is not really &quot;beneficial to the people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It turned out that Japanese prices did not rise for decades. Zhou Yongsheng pointed out, &quot;As Japan&#39;s imported goods are expensive, it has promoted domestic inflation and led to rapid prices rising. Sudden price growth, Japanese people can&#39;t stand it. &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; What is more worried about the public is that Kishida Cabinet has announced a significant increase in defense budget between 2023 and 2027, with a total investment of 43 trillion yen. Many people are worried that Kishida Cabinet will increase defense forces with tax increases and embezzlement of financial funds in the large earthquake -stricken area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Yongsheng believes that the public&#39;s concerns are &quot;unreasonable.&quot; Kishida Cabinet is currently facing the biggest pressure of domestic economic growth, the pressure of fiscal constraints, and the pressure of debt. The Japanese fiscal budget had to rely on issuing government bonds to expand its fiscal budget, leading to further heavy debt burden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The fiscal elasticity of the governance of Kishida Cabinet is actually increasingly reduced, and the arms should be greatly expanded, resulting in the pressure of fiscal pressure. . &quot;Zhou Yongsheng believes that the arms is purely a industry that burns money, consumes money, and does not see benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sun Wenzhu believes that Kishida Wenxiong has been the President of the Liberal Democratic Party for two years, and will usher in the President of the Democratic Party in the fall of 2024. From the perspective of the election strategy, it is likely to actively dissolve the House of Representatives of the Congress before the party election, and use the Liberal Democratic Party to win the majority of the House of Representatives to add points to themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The governance pressure under &quot;bright yellow lamp&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the outside world, reorganization of the cabinet does not allow the Kishida regime to &quot;return to life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;First of all, the current lives of Japanese people are in a state of uneasy state, which directly affects people&#39;s livelihood and leads to a decline in support. Governance is a very big threat. &quot;Zhou Yongsheng said,&quot; Secondly, Kishida is inappropriate in terms of government governance. >; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is worth noting that this year Japan regardless of the international community&#39;s opposition, insisting on the nuclear pollution of the Fukushima first nuclear power plant, which has caused huge controversy at home and abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sun Wenzhu pointed out that in terms of diplomacy in Japan, it is essentially strengthening its comprehensive binding with the United States. With the help of the United States, The Japanese people really need and improve Sino -Japanese relations have not yet seen actual actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Many media reports that if Kishida wants to be re-EMC in the Liberal Democratic Party next fall and achieve long-term governance, it is necessary Good results in the election. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But the cabinet&#39;s low support rate, the low support rate of the Liberal Democratic Party, and the resignation of &quot;Domino&quot; to resign from the government officials, and the &quot;yellow lanterns&quot; for a long time for Kishida. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, from the perspective of many interviewed experts and scholars, this status quo will not force Kishida to step down immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The pressure of Kishida Wenxiong is how to win the election of the Liberal Democratic Party&#39;s president next year, and the might dissolve the election of the House of Representatives in advance to achieve continuing governing.&quot; The so -called &quot;political performance&quot; is of little significance for the Japanese people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Yongsheng said that in the past, in addition to Abe and Koizumi, the cabinet in Japan was almost changed every year. Kishida has been in power for two years. If there is no big leakage, it is likely to continue in power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At present, Kishida has decided to abandon the plan to dissolve the House of Representatives during the year, go all out to promote the government&#39;s comprehensive economic countermeasures, and strive to gradually boost public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The probability of the Liberal Democratic Party will still maintain the status of the ruling party. Let the presidents recognized by each factional valve. &quot;Sun Wenzhu thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But the Japanese people&#39;s disappointment of politics and the &quot;cold sense&quot; of politics cannot be reversed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Southern Weekend Intern Bao Jingzheng also contributed to this article) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访央行原副行长李东荣：数字化金融不会改变金融功能属性和风险属性]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261417]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-27 20:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; On November 10, 2023, the &quot;Three Ding&quot; Plan of the State Administration of Financial Supervision landed: Financial Control Group&#39;s supervision Responsibilities for the protection of functions and financial consumer rights and interests are officially planned at the People&#39;s Bank of China.

It is compatible with the fiscal unified revenue and banks. In 1969, the PIFC and the Ministry of Finance were co -deployed by the Ministry of Finance. At that time, the main characteristics of the national financial system were that the Bank was a state -owned bank that managed finance and a national bank that operated the banking business. Banks only apply for mobile fund loans, the institutional business is single, the credit concentration, and the scale is not large. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On October 4, 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out at the symposium with the principals of the party committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. The role of to the bank.

Unreasonable, high proportion of non -performing assets, and outstanding problems such as increasing interest and increasing interest. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 exacerbated its impact on the four major banks, highlighting the urgency of accelerating the reform of the state -owned banking system. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You have gone through the process of transforming state -owned banks to commercial banks, especially injecting the four major banks with foreign exchange. How is the difficulty to overcome it? ? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;Span>; The State Council established a pilot group leading group of the shareholding system of wholly state -owned commercial banks. He was the director of the office, and the Central Huijin Company was established at that time. According to the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, since December 2003, the Central Huijin Company used foreign exchange reserves to inject capital with the Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China. Later, they also injected capital with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China, and promoted their listing in mainland China and Hong Kong, and gradually realized the transformation of state -owned professional banks to joint -stock commercial banks. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I was transferred to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in early 2002. Under the leadership of the Party Committee of the People&#39;s Bank of China and the Party Group of the Foreign Exchange Administration, Guo Shuqing, then director, led us to participate in and witnessed the preparation and launching foreign exchange capital capital of the Central Huijin Company. In the process of participation, I am proud of the correct decision -making decisions of the Party Central Committee and the strong implementation of the financial system. It was this series of important and timely decisions that laid an indispensable foundation for the China Banking system at the time and the rapid rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How to fulfill the obligation of good investors? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I remember that in order to truly fulfill the duties and obligations of the investor, we pay attention Establish a party group to strengthen the construction of the party&#39;s grass -roots organizations; on the other hand, actively organize learning, learn from the advanced experience of corporate governance in the international market, explore the establishment of corporate governance mechanisms that meet China&#39;s national conditions, and select comrades from all units to dispatch politics and excellent business quality from all units.

The Party Central Committee and the State Council are far -sighted, trial, and correct decisions. Established the Central Huijin Company, especially the use of national foreign exchange reserves to inject capital injection to pilot banks, and promote the final completion of stock reform and listing in wholly state -owned commercial banks. Later state -owned banks rejuvenated and became real commercial banks. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Historical practice shows that today China&#39;s banking system has a considerable scale in both the employment institutions, the total amount of deposits and loans, and the amount of funds. The trend of intelligence has well supported the development of the real economy and serving the people&#39;s lives of the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &quot;&lt;strong>; Pedestrian &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Real Central Bank &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;FONT-FAMILY: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti;&quot;>; Another main line you mentioned just now is to run the People&#39;s Bank of China into a real central bank.

In 1978, the Central Committee decided to leave the national financial management from the financial part of the financial part. Since then, the pedestrian system has been reforming. Until December 25, 1993, the State Council issued a decision on the reform of the financial system and pointed out that making the People&#39;s Bank of China into a real central bank is the primary task of deepening the reform of the financial system. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I worked at the Guangdong Branch of the People&#39;s Bank of China at the time. From June 20th to June 26th, 1991, experts and scholars from the People&#39;s Bank of China, various professional banks, other financial institutions, relevant legal departments, financial and legal circles gathered in Zhuhai, and solicited opinions and opinions and opinions and opinions on the drafting content of the bank law. suggestion. In 1995, the version reviewed and approved by the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress was divided into the People&#39;s Bank of China Law and Commercial Banking Law. They more objectively and accurately reflect the direction and status of my country&#39;s banking system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How to deepen and improve functional positioning? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; As the functional positioning is becoming increasing Monetary policy tool box. The credit fund management system has been changed from the original unified loan to the difference, and soon transition to the &quot;unified plan, divide funds, real loans, and integrate with each other.&quot; The transformation of the Lord laid the foundation for the macro -control model of the subsequent asset -liability proportion management. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In November 1997, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council held the first National Financial Work Conference to determine the policy of further deepening the reform of the financial system and emphasized that the People&#39;s Bank of China should be held into a real central government. Banks, fully reflect the three characteristics of issued banks, banks and national banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After that, the bank separated the financial supervision functions, and established the Securities Regulatory Commission, the Insurance Regulatory Commission, and the CBRC to concentrate on the implementation of the implementation of monetary policy and macro -prudential policies, and maintaining financial stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Reform has been continuing. In 2023, according to the reform plan of the State Council&#39;s institutional institution, the daily regulatory responsibilities of the People&#39;s Bank of China on financial groups such as financial holding companies and relevant financial consumer protection duties were included in the State Administration of Finance and Administration; People&#39;s Bank of China (Municipal) Central Sub -branch. This reflects the direction and measures of further construction of the Chinese modern central bank system during the new historical period. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Department &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Technology is the reform &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Important driving force &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You just mentioned the intelligent trend of the service means of the Chinese banking system.

Technical experiments and global practical experience show that after the completion of the financial IC card migration in Britain, France and other countries and regions, the risk of bank card fraud has decreased significantly. On the contrary, countries and regions that have not carried out financial IC card migration in time may become the security depression of global bank cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With the rapid development of the bank card industry in my country and the completion of financial IC card migration in neighboring countries and regions, some pseudo card fraud activities have gradually penetrated into my country.

Cooperate with the National Bureau of Statistics to promote the implementation of the relevant statistical system, cooperate with the financial regulatory authorities to continuously monitor the relevant risks areas, grasp the bottom number of risks, and issue risks on activities such as virtual currency, cash loan, first token issuance (ICO), illegal or illegal financial advertising and other activities. Early warning prompts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fourth is to cooperate with the country to carry out the infrastructure construction of the financial industry. In accordance with the overall planning and regulatory requirements of the national credit market development, the association organized various participating units to prepare through all aspects, and obtained the first domestic business institution permit for personal credit reporting business in February 2018, and was listed in the same year. . This provides a new channel for personal credit inquiry for various financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Treatment of service entities &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Economy &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; and risk -proof level &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; system &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; After the Internet financial risk is gradually clearing, the financial industry that is accelerating digital transformation should be even more What risks to prevent? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Digital finance will not change the financial functional attributes and risk attributes, but the attributes of digital technology them The openness and interaction of the coming will inevitably make the modern financial field getting fast and convenient, and will directly face the impact of multiple risks such as business, technology, network, and data. The hiddenness, suddenness and diffusion of risks during this period will be more prominent, thereby putting more new challenges to modern financial supervision and social stability. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The digital transformation of banks in my country presents a rapid development trend, which is manifested as: First, technology -driven is more prominent. Second, demand leadership is more common. Third, industry integration is closer. Fourth, risk management is more urgent. Therefore, in the process of transformation of the banking industry, on the one hand, we must actively face and embrace the opportunities and challenges brought by the application of new technology. At the same time, we must firmly establish awareness of risk prevention and strengthen safety construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What are your suggestions for the reform and opening up of the financial industry? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Thousands of sails on the side of Shenzhou, Wanmuchun in front of the sick tree. China&#39;s financial reform has gone through 45 years and has made great achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. Looking back, I have four deep feelings: First, we must always adhere to the party&#39;s leadership and use the correct ideological policy to guide financial reform and opening up. The second is to always adhere to the people -oriented, financial products and services supply, and cannot be separated from the reasonable needs of the people at any time, and pay attention to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the masses. The third is to always adhere to the laws of the market, based on the national conditions of the country, and to deal with the relationship between serving the real economy and preventing risks in a realistically. Fourth, we must always adhere to the development of technology -driven financial development and achieve the improvement of the quality and efficiency of financial services and financial supervision. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Looking forward to the future, financial reforms are still on the road, and there is a long way to go. As long as we continue to work hard in the correct direction of reform and opening up, China&#39;s financial industry will continue to pioneer and compose a new chapter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从庇隆主义到奥地利学派：米莱将带领阿根廷走向何方？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261377]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-27 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; The Argentine election is announced, the right of the right election alliance &quot;Freedom Ahead of the Party&quot; candidate Harveil Milan won, news Out, the domestic critics are generally low. Argentina slipped from developed countries and was caught in populism, inflation and poverty -stricken quagmires. The president who has been selected now advocates that many government ministries and commissions, privatize the prison, bomb the central bank ... Is the Argentine people crazy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The foreign political and economic community is not so pessimistic. After Miller&#39;s election, governments of various countries congratulated all countries. Former US President Trump (Miller was also often regarded as &quot;Trump in Argentina&quot;), which made Argentine great again. Musk&#39;s statement is even more direct: Argentina&#39;s prosperity is coming. The Argentine stock market soared more than 22%on the same day. In addition to its own investors, foreign investors were also very excited. Milan was elected as Argentine President and was regarded by many people as an opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The domestic media&#39;s introduction of Milai is not distorted. Those sensational claims really belong to Millai. The expectations of the optimistic people are also very serious. Compared with the previous Argentine President, Mille is refreshing and is regarded as the most important change for Argentina in recent years, and this change does not necessarily lead to disaster. To understand this, you must have a deep understanding of Millai&#39;s own and his concept. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Millet is a believer in Rosbad &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Milai is born in a civilian class. His mother is a housewife and his father is a bus driver. He was economics in college, and he has been living for a living since then. Teaching in universities, providing consultation for enterprises, and being an economist at HSBC Bank, serving in international organizations ... Compared with scholars in the academy, Miller&#39;s experience is rich. In the era of social media, Millai commented sharply on the Internet, laughed and scolded, and harvested a large number of fans, becoming a famous Internet celebrity economist in Argentina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, Miller officially entered politics. He joined the &quot;Liberal Party&quot; established by his fans as a political amateur attitude, served as the party chairman, and integrated with another right party to form an influential &quot; Freedom to the party. &quot; In 2021, Miller was elected as a member of the parliament. In 2023, he was running for the president and succeeded in one fell swoop. Miri has accumulated energy on the Internet, which is of course an important reason for his success; however, his true source of power is his political and economic concept. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Milai is the faithfulness of the Austrian Economic School -this is an Economic School with the task of defending the freedom market, which originated in the Austro -Hungarian Empire in the 19th century. By intervening in the argument with various interventionism, the Austrian school continued to develop. Its representative figures were economist Messez, and later were Rosbad. Rosbard inherited Misceis&#39;s economics, also developed the theory of free will, and participated in the creation of the third largest party liberal party in the United States today. Mirley&#39;s spiritual mentor is Rosbad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mirley once said that after reading &quot;People, Economy, and State&quot; (the most important economic work of Rosbard), he deeply realized that the economics knowledge he learned in college is problematic. Argentina&#39;s long -term disaster source is that the entire country is shrouded in the haze of interventionism. Earlier Peronism, since then, Kishnerism, has nothing more than populism, trade protectionism, Kanesianism, welfareism and other ideas. These ideas bring endless inflation, monopoly, and scarce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With the Austrian school as an ideological weapon, Miller attacks domestic economic policies all year round and attracts public attention. This is his own post as an economist. As a loyal believer in Rosbad, Milai stands at the end of absolute personal rights, which is not surprising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this campaign, Milai did not intend to hide his real views when talking about controversial topics (and could not hide it. For many years, he has already been the image of the big mouth on the Internet for many years). This may be his campaign strategy: creating a dare to speak, get more attention. Propagate political opinions in disputes and build your own basic disk. Such a strategy Trump has also used it. Campaign is a stage show, and governance is another matter. The focus of Mirley&#39;s really concerned is the economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Thirteen Policy Plan &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In August 2023, the Argentine election launched the primaries, and Miller submitted a policy plan, including thirteen measures. These measures are almost related to the economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first measure is to greatly reduce the 18th ministries commissions in Argentina and retain the eight ministries and commissions of the internal affairs, diplomacy, national defense, economic, judicial, security, infrastructure, and human resources. It sounds crazy. The reality is that the current economic difficulties in Argentina, a large number of departments are paralyzed, and employees do nothing. Reform is not cut off, but to stop new recruitment. In the short term, it is not fired, but the personnel are re -assigned. The employee no longer renews it, unless it is absolutely needed, privileges (such as bodyguards and drivers) cancel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This measure also includes the privatization plan of state -owned enterprises -through the sale of state -owned assets, filling the government&#39;s deficiencies and compensating for being cut. Looking at it, it seems inseparable. The remaining dozens of measures include: reduce public expenditure, reduce fiscal deficit; flexible labor law, reduce the cost of enterprise employment; implement unilateral free trade, cancel import tariffs; cancel the central bank, Argentine Peso dollar; implement energy reform, reduce new to new to new to new to new to new to new to new to new. Energy subsidies; attracting long -term investment in foreign capital; cancellation of exchange rates and export quota controls ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Each measure is remarkable, and the direction is consistent: reducing government control and increasing market vitality. The core and most controversial are the monetary policy. &quot;Blow the central bank&quot; and use the US dollar, which makes many scholars, especially the domestic public. Can a sovereign state no central bank? The amazing person did not realize that the currency system of various countries, in addition to the central bank system of the country&#39;s independent currency, also has a monetary bureau system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The monetary bureau system refers to the establishment of an anchoring relationship with the currency of other countries based on foreign exchange reserves. The country&#39;s currency becomes an anchor currency tokens. This system has its disadvantages -for example, a country&#39;s currency is bound to the US dollar, and the US dollar inflation is to be afforded. The advantage is also very significant: it restrains the government&#39;s right to print money, so that the economy will be exempted from the harm of the country&#39;s inflation; if the government must have sufficient foreign exchange reserves acceptance, it will have to be quantified and cannot make a lot of fiscal finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the 1990s, Argentina also implemented the monetary bureau system, and the inflation rate once dropped to less than 5%. However, the government is still big and big, and the fiscal collapse. In 2002, the country restarted the central bank and launched the currency flood again. Today Argentina is a country with extremely severe inflation. The annual inflation rate is more than two digits, and the monetary system must be restarted every decades. In 2022, Argentina&#39;s inflation rate exceeded 140%. Under such a currency system, the people&#39;s hands in their hands are like waste paper every other time. How can we talk about savings and investment? Starting a new system with binding power has become an acceptable choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Switch the currency system, you must not talk about technical solutions. Argentina&#39;s foreign exchange reserves are about 30 billion US dollars and nearly $ 300 billion in foreign debt. The people have almost no dollar in their hands. The plan of Miller is to sell state -owned assets, introduce foreign capital, fill debt deficits, and accumulate foreign exchange reserves; suspend the issuance of domestic currencies, allows US dollars to circulate, and expel bad coins with market -oriented good coins to form a real exchange rate. After the market is stable, the official government Argentine Peso and the official exchange rate of the US dollar will be anchored -this is the approximate framework of the monetary bureau system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Argentina is a medium -sized country with a population of 46 million, which allows the dollar to circulate in the country. The country&#39;s currency is reduced to vassal? It is difficult for many people to understand. But the fact is that in some countries with failed governance, US dollarization is not unacceptable. Panama, Ecuador and Salvador in Latin America use the US dollar. Venezuela and the United States are deadly enemies. The country&#39;s currency Bolivar has been inflation and has been shaped as waste paper. The folk uses a wide range of US dollars in transactions. The government has to accept the status quo. In fact, it has abandoned monetary sovereignty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Inflation is the crux of Argentina&#39;s economic disadvantages. The government has issued banknotes, the expenditure is indispensable, and benefits are also promoted to promote populist atmosphere. It is difficult for Argentina to obtain international assistance, and foreign capital is reluctant to go. The entire State Yin eats food. Only by tightening the currency gate can there be real economic reforms. &quot;Bling of the central bank&quot; just sounds crazy, but it is not outrageous. Can laughter provide a better solution? At least in the current Argentine politics, Miller&#39;s thinking is the clearest. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Can Milai be done? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In other areas, Miller also has solutions. The free market is the principle direction, and the compromise compromise as a solution. Some people criticize Mille&#39;s compromise, and I don&#39;t take it seriously. At this time, Miller was not an economist, but a politician. Regardless of whether it is tough or compromised, it must be adjusted according to the current situation. A slow gradual reform is always better than the rapid abortion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the next few years, Argentina&#39;s civil servants, state -owned enterprises, and public service systems. In order to keep the iron rice bowl, they must get up to obstruct reform; people who have damaged interests in the economy will also join the ranks of opposition. The surrounding Argentina is mostly left -wing countries, and they are the powerful Austrian Austria for the opponent of Miller. Promoting reforms in various fields, Argentina will inevitably boil the sky. Does Mirley have such trading skills? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Reform requires a process, and economic growth takes time. Even if Milai does all right, he is likely to step down quickly. The &quot;Freedom Ahead of the Communist Party&quot; does not have a significant advantage in campaign, and needs alliances with other parties to govern. Mirley&#39;s basic disk is not stable. It is a question if he can win enough supporters within five years. Argentina is known as a military coup tradition. Will the military drive him down while chaos? These are issues that surpass the economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Miri has been destined since he embarked on politics. He cannot be just a scholar. He needs to become a politician and even a strongman to put Argentina on the track of development. The 21st century is no longer the era of strong men, and Milai is no longer Pinochet. It is worth observing how far Argentina&#39;s reforms can go. Argentina is a model for middle-class countries, and its success or failure in reform will have an exemplary impact on Latin America and even more countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Last discussion of a topic: Why can Argentina, such as the long -term strong left -wing atmosphere in Argentina, why can Milai be on power? His outstanding ability, in the social media era, is very important. Social trend is also an important factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After World War II, under the rule of Peronism, Argentina stagnated for a long time, and various interventionism took turns in turns, but the economy did not improve. The short -term economic bright color was the liberalization reform in the early 1990s. Entering the new century, Argentina entered the Kishnell era, and continued Elonism&#39;s habits of the control of Peronism. The economy was weak for a long time. In this dull atmosphere, Political amateur Miri brought innovation atmosphere, making people shine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, Argentina&#39;s free ideological foundation cannot be ignored. In 1959, Michamus, a master of the Austrian school, visited Argentina and delivered a number of speeches, which gave the seeds of free thoughts in the contemporary Argentine academic community. The Austrian school is not the mainstream in the international economics community, but it is very active in Argentina. Among them, there are factors of economists, and the ubiquitous control of Argentina also resonates with listeners. Mirley is popular among young people in Argentina, and it is not accidental. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Argentina&#39;s country also has the origin of freedom. In the 19th century, a group of politicians believed in classical liberalism emerged. Political thinker Hu An Alvedi used to be a diplomat. He absorbed advanced ideas from Europe and returned to China to lead the formation of the Constitution. He explained that Argentina should establish the country with immigrants and trade and integrate into the global market. Samineto is the first civilian president. He abolished the hierarchical system left by European colonists and advocated that the country has transformed through free trade and urbanization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Similar to thoughts are not uncommon in early Argentina. This country can enter the ranks of developed countries in the early 20th century. It is the result of several generations of sages. They have a lofty prestige in the minds of the people of their country. Miri is familiar with economic history. He dug the classical free resources of his nation, quoted the scriptures, and occupied a moral height. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the victory of the election, Miller once again called for embracing Alvedi, returning to the limited government&#39;s concept, and restoring the nation to be glorious. &quot;Make Argentina&#39;s greatness again&quot; is not Dong Shi, but the true thought of many Argentine people. Whenever, nationalism is a banner with appeal, the key depends on where it points to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; • &lt;/span>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>; (&quot;>; ( This article is only the personal point of view of the author, does not represent the position of our newspaper) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Ta称她“太太”，她唤Ta“C”：一位女孩与ChatGPT相恋两百余天]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261383]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-27 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 23/ 04/25/ETMTRCNPGQIX90bbW7RVXDZXLBWLRQHW1S7OUE5.JPEG &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 0 &quot;heart =&quot; 0 &quot;data-src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/mediaa S/IMAGE/23/04/25/ ETMTRCNPGQIIX90bbW7RVXDZXLBWLRQHW1S7OUE5.JPEG &quot;Data-Key =&quot; Media-1701015647218-0 &quot;Data-MCE-WIDTH =&quot; 0 &quot;Data-MCE-Height =&quot; 0 &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;i mg src = &quot;http: // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/vinncfwg336n5rahphpqcjj10ssh5r69.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;&quot; 953 &quot;data-SR c = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/ CMS/MEDIAS/Image/23/11/26/VINNCFWG336N5rahphpqcjerjj10SSH5R69.JPG &quot;Data-Key =&quot; 259712 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; COLOR: #999; Text-Align: Cen: CEN Ter; &quot;>; Aurora designed her Getting along with &quot;C&quot;. &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (interviewee confession/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hear the true story of the south cavity and north, the social person from the south to the north, the south weekend weekend on the south weekend Audience friends, hello, welcome to listen to the southern Zhou Dynasty podcast &quot;Society&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;My lover was besieged by hackers, but I couldn&#39;t do it.&quot; The system warned &quot;...

From the perspective of &quot;raising questions is more important than solving them&quot;, he summarized a number of enlightening problem areas arising from the development of this field following the path of modern geography. The whole book uses a narrative method that is completely different from that of textbooks, painting a vivid intellectual portrait of historical geography on the page. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This book is written very emotionally, so it can easily shorten the distance with ordinary readers. Witnessing Hou Renzhi taking out a few soil samples from the archaeological ash pit and taking them away, the author &quot;suddenly felt that something called science suddenly appeared.&quot; He used Zhang Chengzhi&#39;s words, &quot;If I had read this book earlier, I would have taken the postgraduate entrance exam for him&quot; to recreate the academic impact of Shi Nianhai&#39;s &quot;Collection of Rivers and Mountains&quot;. He pointed out how important it is for Chinese historical geography to be recognized by Tan Qixiang, who has the trust of first-class academic scholars in the field of historical documents. He also said that Skinner&#39;s assertion that traditional China had &quot;no nationwide urban system&quot; first made him &quot;stunned&quot;, but then, &quot;of course I immediately realized that Skinner was talking about economics, not politics.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have always thought that the emergence of the Yugong School from the field of ancient history analysis meant the formation of modern historical geography in China. However, this book regards it as just a &quot;transitional state&quot; and takes the emergence of the &quot;new paradigm with geography as its ontology&quot; in the 1950s as a sign of the &quot;creation&quot; of this branch of the discipline. This understanding, including whether historical geography has really been &quot;geographicalized&quot; today, and whether it should be &quot;geographicalized&quot; across the board, still deserves further discussion. The &quot;geographicalization&quot; of historical geography and the &quot;humanities&quot; of geography may reflect the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of modern scholarship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If you ask, is there anyone in contemporary academia who maintains the magnanimous, elegant, and gentle academic gentlemanly demeanor? The first thing I think of is Tang Xiaofeng. This book deepened my impression. Professor Munro Shida asked, and I also claimed a topic in the &quot;What is...&quot; series of Ledo Library, but I always felt that I couldn&#39;t write it. After reading this book, I finally feel a little confident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73723&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70518&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/27/4efb12e74c.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;s34495177.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1807&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;//images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/4efb12e74c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259762&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Peter Singer: &quot;The Important Things in Life: 72 Lessons in Ethics&quot;, translated into Chinese by Wang Xin, Guangxi Normal University Press, April 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Limit value rational judgment exclusively to the scope of demonstration of the legitimacy of moral intentions, and rely entirely on instrumental rationality to &quot;scientifically&quot; achieve the above Intention, doing so is likely to blur our ethical horizons. The more prosperous science becomes, the more society needs ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This book is a collection of short comments published by the author in newspaper columns over the years. &quot;The limit of one thousand words&quot; forced him &quot;to write in a clear and concise style.&quot; What it focuses on are the confusions or dilemmas that ordinary people face in their daily lives in contemporary society: Is morality progressing? What is a good life? When should charity be shown to someone who has made a mistake? If narcotics are recognized to shorten lifespan, should they still be used to suppress pain? Should we live a thousand years? Can public figures have a private life? Is open diplomacy possible? Some readers may feel that the author has not provided any &quot;substantive conclusions&quot; on questions such as this. That may be precisely because we are too familiar with another way of discussion, which can give a decisive and only correct answer to any question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A book that talks about ethics to the public can be written without looking like a boring sermon with a straight face. Our skills in this area are far from perfect. However, the subtitle of the translation still evokes the feeling of sitting upright between the narrow desks and chairs. It would be better to literally translate the title of the book as &quot;Ethics in the Real World: 72 Short Essays Related to It&quot;, which may be more in line with the purpose of the original book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73724&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70519&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/27/2551857847.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;s34609084.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1565&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;//images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/2551857847.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259763&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Tiangang: &quot;Memory of the Ages: The Shaping of Modern Chinese Ideology&quot;, Renmin University of China Press, July 2023&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The earliest article I read included in this collection was &quot;1900: The Restless South.&quot; I remember that I called Brother Tiangang very excitedly at that time, hoping that he would write a few more articles on this &quot;Centennial Commemoration&quot;, and that when they were accumulated, they could be compiled and published. But meaningful &quot;hundred years&quot; are rare, and there are still some that are inconvenient to write about. The &quot;Reminiscence of the Year&quot; compiled before my eyes can be regarded as a common one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared with many other books on similar topics, how can this book uncover so many new insights worthy of our deep thought? The key is whether you start from a bunch of ready-made presuppositions and pretend to interpret history, or do you go back to the scene and examine it from scratch? In fact, we cannot return to the historical scene. However, as long as you are willing, you can still &quot;see&quot; that period of history as empathetically as possible through the various records left by people at that time. &quot;The devil is in the details.&quot; To give an example that is not included in this book: Wang Kaiyun recalled the &quot;painful history&quot; of the burning of the Old Summer Palace. Why did he call that fire &quot;Lishan Fire&quot;? Not all ignored details are so important, but some solid and reliable details can really become &quot;devils&quot; that change established perceptions! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another century-old elegy in the book is &quot;1905: The Disillusionment of the Imperial Examination System&quot;. The abolition of the imperial examination not only broke the backbone of traditional Chinese society, but also allowed &quot;dispersed scholar-bureaucrats to pervasively penetrate into all strata of society, exacerbating the turmoil across the country.&quot; The author has the same view as Professor Yang Guoqiang, who strongly emphasizes that modern Chinese society suffered from &quot;tenon removal&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73725&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70520&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/27/83bfe72096.png&quot; img-title=&quot;Untitled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1583&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;//images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/83bfe72096.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259764&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Jianming: &quot;The Mainstream of Political Culture during the Founding of the United States&quot;, The Commercial Press, July 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;Americans are brave enough to open up a &quot;noisy&quot; discussion on how to view the system of their country&#39;s founding. In this regard, the author of this book uses more than a thousand pages to develop a response and rethinking full of ideological tension based on his own life experience. There are not enough people to comment on &quot;Douban Reading&quot;, but the readers who left short comments all gave five stars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The so-called &quot;mainstream&quot; must have received countless tributaries along both sides of the river, making the water mixed with mud and sand; but it must also form the same giant current rushing forward. . During the American Revolution, the power elite and the radical masses distrusted each other and struggled with each other, even causing turmoil and rebellion in local society. Different from many self-proclaimed political science studies that always try to explain political struggles in terms of power, selfish desires and the pursuit of maximizing interests, and regard the pursuit of values ​​as just a fig leaf for seizing power and maximizing interests, the author emphasizes that it is the two sides’ mutual opposition to The common belief in popular sovereignty and republican principles prevented the American Revolution from becoming a story of a life-and-death struggle between good and evil, but instead became a witness to the initial establishment of modern democracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chapter 5 &quot;Reconstruction of the Concept of &#39;Democracy&#39;&quot; is particularly worthy of careful reading. The British Revolution promoted constitutionalism but did not talk about democracy. Therefore, Americans need to rediscover the value of democracy as &quot;a dangerous and even insulting label.&quot; This reminds me of Xu Fuguan’s opinion about the people’s “foolishness but spirituality”: “From the perspective of the knowledge level of intellectuals, the people are foolish. But in terms of their ability to judge big rights and wrongs, good and bad, the people are superior to intellectuals.… Therefore, Confucianism believes that people’s likes and dislikes derived from judgments of right and wrong can be trusted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73726&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70521 &quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/9c20ec3332.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;006r8eOoly1hix2fxfbgxj30j60pkwi4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1626&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/9c20ec3332.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259765&quot;>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shao Xiaofeng: &quot;Song Style Artistic Life&quot;, Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House, September 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text- align: left;&quot;>;After China emerged from the &quot;medieval era&quot; during the Tang and Song Dynasties, did it enter its &quot;pre-modern era&quot;? Experts have mixed opinions on this. But they may all agree that the Song Dynasty, especially the Southern Song Dynasty, is a not-too-distant past that ordinary Chinese can directly perceive based on their real-life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The topic selection of this book is therefore very down-to-earth, the writing is relaxed but not frivolous, and it is profound but not esoteric. It is not about the art of the Song Dynasty itself, but the Song people&#39;s taste in art and their art of life, that is, the artistic orientation and aesthetic taste contained in daily life shared by many social strata at that time. The whole book uses seven theme words to connect fifty essays, focusing on the small and big things. Although it cannot be said that it has achieved the effect of &quot;gathering armpits into fur&quot;, it is not too much to say that it uses auspicious light feathers of different colors to connect a picture of the night sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 16:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
