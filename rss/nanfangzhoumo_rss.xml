Feeling humiliated and excited at the same time, he opened the first page of the computer document and read &quot;Mistake by the River&quot; in enlarged font size. Below it were two lines of small characters, original work: Yu Hua, director: Wei Shujun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wants to adapt this novella published in 1988. The perpetrators of the three murders all pointed to madmen, but they could not build a complete chain of evidence to bring him to justice, which made both the town and the criminal police captain Ma Zhe uneasy. Writer Yu Hua&#39;s parody of detective novels in the avant-garde literature period used violent absurdity as the surface and subversion of tradition as the core. I have sold the copyright several times but have never changed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difficult thing is to find a word that points to the philosophy behind all suspenseful stories. In 2021, Wei Shujun and screenwriter Kang Chunlei entered the second year of their adaptation. After overturning the general direction twice, they were determined to find the word. They searched for two days and two nights, wandering around the house until they got something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Bug.&quot; He was quite satisfied with this new development. &quot;It is a word born from the progress of information technology. It is a vulnerability problem based on code and the best rational logic. We think it is too accurate. , isn&#39;t our &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot; called &#39;Ripples of Life&#39;, this one is called &#39;Bugs of Life&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was August 2021, and Wei Shujun was preparing to shoot a new film in Northeast China &quot;White Crane Spreads Wings&quot;. After work, the crew plays badminton together. However, indoor venues have been closed due to the new crown epidemic, and they are planning to play basketball outdoors instead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A month ago, his second feature film &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; was selected for the Directors&#39; Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival; a year ago, his first feature film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; was nominated for the Cannes Newcomer Award. As a feature film director, his graduate work &quot;Yanbian Boy&quot; won the Cannes Short Film Special Mention Award. He received critical acclaim when he first appeared on the scene. Industry seniors and critics praised his talents and talents, and were curious about the possibilities he brought to the table. sex. Wei Shujun received attention as a result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the adaptation of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; quickly fell into another strange circle. Bugs do not exist alone. To describe rational loopholes and loss of control, the premise is to explain what rationality is. The argument about rationality is a wide-ranging, academic discussion that is energy-consuming and unnecessary. &quot;We looked in the wrong direction again,&quot; we had to give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By chance, while scouting locations in Hangzhou, Wei Shujun felt that there should be a dream at the end of the story. &quot;The causes of their deaths are not completely connected on a rational level and cannot serve to solve the case. But in the dream, they interlock with each other, as if they are all established, revealing a certain inevitability in a series of accidents, giving people a creepy feeling.&quot; In the final version of the script, dreams became the core sequence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seems to be his consistent creative approach, which values ​​the true feelings of the creative subject and expresses them effectively in the film. Photography director Cheng Ma, who has worked with him three times, provided evidence: &quot;We basically create based on our feelings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Ma and Wei Shujun met for the first time in Shanghai three years ago, and they chatted quite well. . They have many consensuses on the nature and creative concepts of movies, two of which are simple but very important: movies were created to create &quot;realistic illusions&quot; at the beginning, and they should still be so today, and movies may not be the best way to tell stories. It is a medium, but it is a channel for storing and transmitting the creator’s feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, regarding &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot;, Wei Shujun told Cheng Ma that it was restrained, quiet, and elegant, and that many things happened on a humid and rainy day. This was how he felt when reading the novel. Accordingly, Cheng Ma felt that the images should be consistent with the 1990s, when the characters were wandering and out of place, and geographical features such as counties or towns were far away, not close. Cheng Ma suggested shooting on 16mm film, and they hit it off immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, with 45 days left before filming, the crew arrived in Nanfeng, Jiangxi Province, where the filming took place, to make preparations. The actors were busy with their own work. Tong Linkai had to practice splits and back fists. Zhu Yilong wore a leather jacket to visit the local police and gained 30 pounds to achieve an overworked figure. Zeng Meihuizi was also making herself gain weight in order to look like a pregnant woman. The crew cooked together, watched movies, and played badminton. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think the best state of creation is when all the main creators are relaxed. I don’t like that kind of tense, night-and-night (state) like a repair project, which is very tiring. That is to say, although it is You are working, but you still have your own life order, and you still retain your pursuit of beauty and passion for life.&quot; Wei Shujun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often carries a film camera with him - the crew has a total of more than 20 film cameras, and even a darkroom for developing black and white photos - to capture the daily life of the crew. There are more saved in the photo album on his mobile phone. When he opens it and looks through it, he sees friends meeting, travel scenes, rivers, trees, and the sea. “It seems to have some kind of ability to leave time behind, making you think of it as a pleasant time.” In the afternoon, a happy state.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relaxation is rare. What is also rare is that, in Cheng Ma&#39;s words, Wei Shujun places a particularly high importance on creation. &quot;As a director of his age, he can actually withstand a lot of pressure. We have to shoot smoothly, but many people ask us what to do with the scenes and what to do with the actors&#39; time. For example, a certain role has many scenes, but the actors can only come for 10 days in total. , the usual approach of the crew is to focus on filming all his scenes in these 10 days. But Wei Shujun feels that smooth filming is of great value to his creation, so he will give up scenes that cannot be matched by actors or at inappropriate times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Chunlei also said: &quot;I think he has an almost intuitive ability to control the scene. I always told him, you shine on the scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also Once, Wei Shujun changed his character&#39;s name on the spot. In the novel, Ma Zhe&#39;s subordinate is Xiao Li, a young man who takes the initiative to report case analysis from time to time. So of course Tong Linkai’s name is Xiao Li. After a few days of filming, Wei Shujun suddenly said, thank you so much &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (&quot;Thanks&quot; means shit)&lt;/span>;, don&#39;t call me Xiao Li. Just call me Xiao Xie. Wei Shujun greeted other actors and revised his lines. The printed police officer ID card of Xiao Li was re-attached. Tong Linkai&#39;s role became Xiao Xie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to be honest, the feeling at the scene was not that wonderful. Wei Shujun&#39;s own version is: &quot;Imagine that when you were in school, you had to sit in the classroom at 7 a.m. every morning to study early. On the way from home after breakfast, you felt that you were still waking up. When you got to class, you thought about writing yesterday&#39;s homework. No, I didn’t write it, so I wrote it quickly. After I wrote it, I felt very at ease. I started to think about going to the canteen to buy something to eat during recess, and then I went to the actual class to listen to the teacher. It was the same on the set, everyone was here, Shui After brewing it, we started drinking water. We walked around the scene and the actors were almost done. Then we discussed the scene and confirmed our schedule with the photographer. Everyone prepared individually and then started to prepare for shooting. If something didn’t feel right in the first two days, Adjust it, and it feels good. If you take a few more shots, it will be time for lunch. It really feels like this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is a slope every day, and you have to climb up a slope. You have to crawl over to get to that position.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; was completed accurately and efficiently, and was shortlisted for the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the Cannes Film Festival. Five months later, it won two honors: Best Film and Cinephile Choice at the Pingyao International Film Festival. After another four days, it was released nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the film, there was often chatter in the theater. Wei Shujun used a long dream to allow Ma Zhe to reveal himself in order to resolve his own uneasiness and chaos. The dream was clear, coherent but illogical. After witnessing everyone&#39;s death by the river, Ma Zhe sat on an old cinema seat and saw the director on the big screen holding a ping pong ball with the number 3 printed on it, shouting at him. ——Ma Zhe! Third class merit! In this shot where conjecture and prophecy overlap, thousands of ping pong balls roll down from the bottom of the screen and swarm towards Ma Zhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone was very excited during the shooting. After taking one shot, everyone picked up the thousands of ping pong balls while shouting &quot;One more, another one&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the show, the audience was full of doubts and endless interpretations and comments about the film, forming multiple dreams outside the screen, a kind of &quot;rationality and irrationality, the combination of the viewer and the viewer.&quot; effect&quot;. From this perspective, Wei Shujun&#39;s initial uneasiness when reading the novel, his exploration of the creator&#39;s intentions, and his several elusive moments during the adaptation were all conveyed to the audience. We think we have the answer, but in fact we have the illusion of an answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am not too obsessed with pursuing the truth in life, because I feel that it is difficult to find it.&quot; Cheng Ma said that this is another consensus between him and Wei Shujun that the truth is difficult to find, &quot;the so-called The fate of your life is a random existence. You can only see its existence and don’t know the truth behind it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The slight existentialist tendency of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is just that Back to &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;, or in other words, &quot;back to the thing itself&quot;. Just reiterate one point, &quot;I believe that I &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(creator)&lt;/span>; has determined the sole right of interpretation, and the audience must accept this interpretation Right, this is the biggest paradox.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the movie was released, Wei Shujun sent a message to Yu Hua, saying that it seems that we did not use a movie to write annotations for the novel, but used the movie to write an annotation for the novel. Thoughts after reading. For a while, the two of them were keen to share with each other the audience&#39;s various interpretations of the movie, including a test paper on &quot;Who understands the movie &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; better, Yu Hua or me?&quot; After Yu Hua finished, he showed Wei Shujun his score, which totaled 40 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Thanks to Zhang Yuxin for your help.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[不恋爱，搞事业，迪士尼又来了新公主]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261316]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-25 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;In 1923, young Walt ·Disney came to Los Angeles and joined his brother Roy Disney.

To commemorate this moment, it has launched a new animated feature film &quot;Star Wish&quot; 》. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/353e94e2bec94f8dde0a2d4c5ab0a0d9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1563&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/353e94e2bec94f8dde0a2d4c5ab0a0d9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259598&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Disney is a dream maker&lt;/span>; factory, and most of its animated stories encourage people to bravely pursue their dreams. As a tribute to the centenary, &quot;Star Wish&quot; certainly closely follows this theme. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of the movie is set in a kingdom of wishes called Rosas. People come from all directions to offer their dreams to the magical King Manifico, and the king will choose the right person from them. Help them achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The heroine Yasha’s biggest wish is that her grandfather’s dream comes true. However, when she came into contact with King Manifico, she realized that &lt;span>; the king was not as kind and generous as he appeared on the surface. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259601 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Manifico is an extreme conservative. He will only select dreams that he considers harmless to realize, while shelving creative dreams. He regarded such dreams as a scourge that would shake Rosas&#39;s foundations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course Asha disagrees with the king&#39;s point of view, so she joins forces with the wishing star and Valentino the goat to try to get her grandfather&#39;s dream back. The king, under the temptation of lust for power, further darkened. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/74d2011fa8ecac1b3913c1015dd621ca.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/74d2011fa8ecac1b3913c1015dd621ca.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259600 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The assists in the movie, the wishing star and the goat, are easily reminiscent of the combination of Olaf and the reindeer in &quot;Frozen&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In fact, &quot;Wish&quot; did use the production team of &quot;Frozen&quot;, directed by Chris Buck&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (&quot;Frozen&quot;)&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Co-directed with Fawn Villasensohn&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(&quot;Dragon&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;; Jennifer Lee&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(&quot;Crazy&quot;) Zootopia&quot;, &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, Allison Moore, Chris Buck&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(&quot;Frozen&quot;)&lt;/span>; &lt;span>; Co-screenwriter; Liu Yifei and &quot;Feng Shen&quot; star Yu Shi voice the heroine Asha and the goat Valentino respectively. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/b84fb45c94d73c7e1f362563182558b4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;423&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/b84fb45c94d73c7e1f362563182558b4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259596 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/88d8e113486ed2c5ea475b6ca9393435.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;481&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/88d8e113486ed2c5ea475b6ca9393435.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259597&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the past, Disney always promoted the truth, goodness and beauty in the world, but &quot;Star Wish&quot; used a lot of space to depict the process of the king&#39;s ambition expanding and eventually being backlashed. And &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;No matter what the situation, Asha was always loyal to her heart, &lt;/span>; and won more allies, and finally overthrew Manifico&#39;s rule. The dystopian nature of the movie is very un-Disney. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t agree with your point of view, but I will defend to the death your right to speak.&quot; Putting it here is an excellent comment. Everyone has the right to pursue their dreams, and the king cannot deny it easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being good at creating dreams, Disney is also good at creating princesses. Since the release of Snow White (Disney&#39;s first animated feature film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;) in 1937, Disney has followed the development of the times for more than 80 years and successively launched more than a dozen characters. Princess. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/484faf306e6df3f6adc26b4a7344eea8.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;612&quot; height=&quot;342&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/484faf306e6df3f6adc26b4a7344eea8.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259602 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Early&lt;/span>; Disney princesses, beautiful and innocent, with supreme love: Snow White who ate the poison apple waited for the prince to kiss them awake; Cinderella who dropped her crystal slipper ( &quot;Cinderella,&quot; 1950) relies on the prince to rescue her; the cursed Princess Aurora (&quot;Sleeping Beauty,&quot; 1959) also wants a kiss from the prince&#39;s true love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that the princesses of this period satisfied people&#39;s beautiful imagination of love, but they were too dependent on men, had beauty but no brains, and were always in a passive &lt;span>; situation waiting for the prince to save them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/09b2f11f3d59a649db4c87c8f166cd63.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;685&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/09b2f11f3d59a649db4c87c8f166cd63.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259604 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Especially the box office failure of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; made Disney&lt;/span>; start to reflect. Later princesses have improved their initiative and self-awareness. For example, Ariel in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989) sacrifices singing to walk on land in order to meet the man she loves; Ariel in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) Belle and the ugly beast have been in love for a long time; Jasmine in &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; refuses the king&#39;s offer Referring to marriage, falling in love with Aladdin. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The princesses of this period&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; will take the initiative to fight for what they want, but&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; Their goal in life is still to find true love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/631f8f80da83892c3fea154bbfc85969.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/631f8f80da83892c3fea154bbfc85969.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259603 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such &quot;progress&quot; was obviously not enough.

The family relationship between the two sisters became the main thread, and the handsome prince became the villain of the entire film. The princess no longer passively waits for the prince to save her, the princess herself is very powerful; true love no longer involves the prince kissing the princess, and the sisterhood is also very touching. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/c1da20b56f8dbd4531cb0b088ba7c214.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;418&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/c1da20b56f8dbd4531cb0b088ba7c214.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259606 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be said that Disney subverted Disney. Starting from this&lt;/span>;movie, Disney princesses completely got rid of the male gaze. They took off their costumes and became their own heroes. Like the &lt;span>; princesses in &quot;Moana&quot; (2016) and &quot;Legend of the Dragon&quot; (2021), they all gave up on romance. One lived her life how she wanted, and the other led her people to protect their home and country. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259607 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;And this &quot;Star Wish&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is also of the same origin&lt;/span>;. Asha dares to question and is not afraid of power. In order to protect all the residents of Rosas He did not hesitate to stand on the opposite side of King Manifico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But compared with the previous princesses, Asha&#39;s combat effectiveness is obviously weakened. She no longer has the ability to go to heaven and earth. She is more like an ordinary person, a civilian hero who resists the aloof king. Just like the theme song of the movie sings, &quot;Maybe you are afraid but you still reach out your hand, and you will not run away because of a weak tremor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This may also be the century-old road that Disney has walked for itself.

Each one has a story that is compelling and extraordinary. But Yi Mengling’s story clearly does not fall into this category. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to define Yi Mengling seems to be an issue that the public is more interested in now. She is a model, a blogger, an Internet celebrity, and a newcomer to the film and television industry. And Yi Mengling is still making a lot of attempts and challenges. Maybe there will be more labels and identities added to her name in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is widely known because of Yi Mengling’s unique style of photos and short videos. With good aesthetics, makeup and outfits, coupled with sunshine, smile and always bright attitude, Yi Mengling has gained tens of millions of fans on social platforms. She didn&#39;t take the initiative to define anything, but various labels followed, such as &quot;a sense of atmosphere&quot; and &quot;a sense of pure desire&quot;...these labels were either envy, love, or ill-intentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the interview, this thin girl who attracted too much attention walked up to the filming site on the second floor and greeted everyone who came her way. During the shooting break, she skillfully communicated with the photographer about technical issues, &quot;You have to trust me.&quot; When discussing a certain lighting technique, she sincerely gave her suggestions, which made the photographer laugh out loud. laugh. Yi Mengling had not eaten anything from morning to noon. When the accompanying staff hurriedly delivered the takeaway during the break, she said, &quot;Just a few bites&quot; and &quot;call me when you are ready.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This may be a more realistic look of Yi Mengling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, some people imitated her, some people disdained her, and there were more and more discussions about her. However, Yi Mengling rarely fought with netizens, and she still only exported life related to herself. fragment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also occasionally responds to some controversial discussions. For example, &quot;Big Mouth&quot; brings a signature smile, but also brings ridicule. Yi Mengling&#39;s response is more of self-acceptance and gratitude, which makes her unique in the field of modeling. For example, after recording her first experience in acting and variety shows, netizens compared her with female celebrities because of her acting skills and appearance. More comments about &quot;Internet celebrities should not enter the entertainment industry&quot; followed. But in Yi Mengling&#39;s view, she treats the world as a big playground and is an experiential player. It takes courage to try different things and challenge different things, but she thinks the process of taking the challenge is cool, and she is also cool if she chooses to challenge herself. &quot;No matter what the result is, it is all experience. I think it is worth it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone likes Yi Mengling. In addition to her beauty, they also like her calm personality. Many times, she is trying her best to relieve some anxiety and output some positive energy. For example, she appeared without makeup, shared her tips behind taking photos, and posted photos of her belly with meat after meals, making everyone feel that beauty is not a statue, but a living person. Similarly, such behavior will still cause dissatisfaction. Some people feel that this is deliberate or a &quot;concave and down-to-earth persona&quot;. No matter what she said, Yi Mengling accepted it all. In her opinion, she actually has nothing to be taboo about. As a public figure, it is essential to face criticism. Many of the things others said were exaggerated, so just laugh after reading them. Yi Mengling said: &quot;Try not to fall into the vicious circle of self-evidence. After all, explanations are never-ending.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is an amateur and has a place on the Internet with her own advantages. It seems that all internet celebrities can be found in her, but she cannot be classified into the same category as anyone. Yi Mengling&#39;s story may not be complicated, but no matter what, she fought her way out of the siege in a place where the fighting was more intense. To a certain extent, whether the public recognizes it or not, she has courage, tenacity and strength beyond her age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About an ordinary girl becoming the focus of the spotlight, how does she face all this? The following is Yi Mengling’s answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Rather than being self-consistent, it is better to say that I am trying to find growth here&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you still remember the turning points that you think are important?

At the press conference of the State Medical Insurance Bureau on November 24, 2023, Fu Chaoqi, deputy director of the Office of the State Medical Insurance Bureau, provided the above data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fu Chaoqi pointed out that from the activation of the provinces of the medical insurance code, Zhejiang and Qinghai provinces have taken the lead in achieving coverage of insured in the province, and the activation rate of more than half of the provinces of more than half of the provinces exceeds 75%. According to the data calculated by Tencent, for an ordinary insured, the appointment registration can be achieved through the WeChat public account before the clinic. During the settlement, the medical insurance code can be used to complete the online medical insurance payment, which saves 43 minutes for each clinic. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Breaking the barriers, use the entire process of medical purchase of medicines &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Purchase medicines at hospitals and pharmacies, and the mobile phone &quot;bright code&quot; can be traced back to four years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 24, 2019, the first medical insurance code (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti;&quot;>; Medical Insurance Electronic Volume &lt;/span>;) Provincial Jinan City activation. At that time, the National Medical Insurance Bureau hoped that the medical insurance code was not only simple electronic, but the vision of &quot;seeing a doctor without cards, only using medical insurance codes&quot;. Standard nationwide unified, cross -regional mutual recognition, and an electronic voucher can be processed. All medical insurance business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Four years later, these visions not only gradually landed, but also made new attempts. Take Zhejiang Province as an example. In the past, there were 54 medical insurance systems in Zhejiang, which divided each other and did not share each other. Until March 2022, Zhejiang&#39;s &quot;Smart Medical Insurance&quot; system accepted the national medical security platform across the region to achieve the same medical insurance settlement in Zhejiang Province The set system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Cao Cen, deputy director of the Zhejiang Medical Insurance Bureau, introduced that all designated medical institutions in Zhejiang have transformed the HIS (hospital information management system) to support the use of medical insurance code throughout the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, in Zhejiang Provincial Hospital, from registered, medical, payment, inspection tests, printing reports, to obtaining drugs, hospitalization and medical insurance settlement, it can be completed as long as the code scan the code; , Medical Insurance Code support prescription circulation, purchase of drugs and medicine, medical insurance settlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The medical insurance code also opened up the barriers outside the hospital. Zhejiang Jinhua City Central Hospital mentioned in a paper that the electronic prescription circulation through the application of medical insurance codes can choose &quot;dual channels&quot; by themselves (through the two channels of fixed -point medical institutions and fixed retail pharmacies, to meet the conditions for synchronization of conditions and include medical insurance payment ) Purchase prescription drugs for fixed -point retail pharmacies to enjoy the same reimbursement treatment as the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The service scenario changes from the&quot; single point &#39;to&#39;. &quot;Xie Zhangyi, deputy director of the State Medical Insurance Bureau&#39;s Financial Regulations Department, said that the entire process of medical insurance codes is the key work of the medical insurance department in 2023 One is to promote the use of medical insurance codes from the entire process of reservation registration, sign -in, diagnosis and treatment, report inquiry, pharmacies and drugs in reservation registration, sign -in, diagnosis and treatment examination, report inquiry, and pharmacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Family favors, so that the elderly and children are convenient. &lt;/H4>; &lt;p>; The hospital is mostly the elderly. It is particularly important how fashionable technology takes into account the needs of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A paper from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital mentioned that the average age of medical insurance patients in Hangzhou in 2021 is 55 years, of which about 40%of them are 60 and over. &quot;On the one hand, elderly patients are intelligent. The use of mobile phones is low; on the other hand, compared with young people, the proficiency and fluency of elderly patients using smartphones are poor. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In terms of aginging transformation, the WeChat medical insurance code has been launched on the barrier -free version, supporting the visually impaired people to use the medical code through voice, and at the same time launch a family account service in many provinces, apply face recognition and other technologies to support relatives to support relatives Agent business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qiu Yunqing told the southern weekend reporter that most of the elderly have family members to accompany them. Through the function of medical insurance family account function, the family members who accompany the companion can bind the medical insurance code of the elderly to their accounts to facilitate the appointment and payment for the elderly for the elderly cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, according to the medical insurance policy in Zhejiang and other places, the personal account of insurance participants has passed the &quot;family support filing&quot; in the years, which can be used to directly pay the spouse of the same medical insurance to participate in the basic medical insurance. The medical insurance cost of children and parents. For example, young people&#39;s personal accounts cannot be used, they can be used for parents, &quot;(&lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti; &quot;>; Parent &lt;/span>; The medical insurance sent a text message. What medicine and how much money was prescribed, it was also very convenient after binding. You can pay with your own account money. &quot;Qiu Yunqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We also pay attention to the needs of medical insurance services that are more difficult to use in intelligent technologies such as the elderly, minors, etc., effectively integrate traditional services with intelligent methods, and launch family accounts, medical treatment on different places, etc. Function, and adding offline activities of the medical insurance code in the medical insurance agency, helping special groups to obtain and enjoying the medical insurance services, and improving the accessibility of medical insurance convenience services. &quot;Xie Zhangyi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Be wary of the use of medical insurance codes to ensure the safety of medical insurance funds &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; However, while the medical insurance code is convenient, how to ensure the safety of the medical insurance fund also brings challenges to all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Guangzhou Medical Insurance Service Center pointed out in a paper that there is no related photo information for medical insurance electronic vouchers. Regulatory work brings difficulty and challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September 2023, the Putian police detected a case that used medical insurance codes. After the villagers died, their relatives used medical insurance codes to seek medical reimbursement and cheated 1232.73 yuan for medical insurance funds. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Junjie, general manager of Alipay Medical and Health Division, said that the system will analyze multi -factor security technical analysis of information such as the use habits of the insured, account change and other information. Once abnormalities are found, immediately report the medical insurance bureau and start the risk control system. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In June 2023, the State Medical Insurance Bureau issued the &quot;Two -Combination of Three Supplements&quot; Work Plan &quot;of the National Medical Insurance Bureau, requiring medical insurance data to be connected vertically and horizontally to achieve comprehensive supervision of the medical insurance fund. The National Medical Insurance Bureau also requested that before the end of 2023, all the intelligent regulatory subsystems were launched in all regions. At the end of 2025, the intelligent audit and electronic monitoring system was basically established. The data is closely connected to form a normalized regulatory system of daily review and on -site inspection, big data analysis, and intelligent monitoring of the whole scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the medical insurance code users broke 1 billion, the National Medical Insurance Bureau was also promoting the service function of the medical insurance code from &quot;available&quot; to &quot;easy to use&quot;. &quot;At present, the masses&#39; demand for medical insurance services presents a multi -level, diversified and personalized characteristics. Combined with the actual needs of the masses, the medical insurance department has launched a batch of fun and use of the masses&#39;&quot; Internet+medical insurance services&#39;. The diagnosis, one -button recipe, re -examination of drugs, online settlement, medicine delivery, etc., can better meet the needs of the masses to see a doctor and buy medicine, &quot;said Xie Zhangyi, deputy director of the Department of Finance and Regulations of the State Medical Insurance Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Southern Weekend Intern Xi Lijie also contributed) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/p >; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx. net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.run &lt;/a>; &lt;/&lt;/ div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[父亲带脑梗儿子跑网约车感动万千网友：灵活就业让赚钱与陪伴得以两全]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261194]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-25 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; This is a news that all middle-aged fathers will see it.

In 2021, Yi Heping&#39;s son was admitted to the hospital for cerebral infarction; in early 2023, Xiaoyi was sent to the emergency room again due to cerebral hemorrhage. After treatment, Xiaoyi&#39;s physical condition gradually recovered, but he lost his ability to take care of himself. In order to better take care of his son, Yi Heping took Xiaoyi to &quot;on the road&quot; together. He has encountered the cancellation of orders and is also understood and considerate by more passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As far as the destiny and the set of people are concerned, he has two &quot;cuts&quot;. One is the loser of Shanghai. Yi Heping used to be &quot;Boss Yi&quot;. In 1996, he went to Shenzhen to start a business and became an earlier group of people who operated communication equipment. Since then He decided to return Yijin to his hometown and return to Chongqing to start a business. At that time, there were more than 20 million yuan on his personal account. There were all villas and luxury cars, as well as his own full -time driver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2015, Yihe&#39;s investment failed, resulting in bankruptcy, and many years of hard work. This trajectory is desolate and sad, full of frustration of middle -aged men; the other is the father who is struggling between making money to support his family and take care of his son. His wife could not take care of her son due to diabetes, coronary heart disease, etc. This burden could only be carried by this tired father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, such a story is &quot;lonely&quot;, but those who bring their children or their loved ones &quot;on the road&quot; to ask for life is not just Yihe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, Anhui Takeaway Brother Li Yuanyuan put the only six months old, and put the takeaway in the takeaway box, which attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In January 2022, the media reported that Guizhou guy Xiao Xin took his 3 -year -old son to takeaway. Life is not good for him, divorced, second child, baby, and work hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2022, a video of a playback and review volume of 100,000 + attracted attention. Children, and take her takeaway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2023, the Hyundai Express reported that &quot;Uncle Bald&quot; Fu Zhenyang from Liu&#39;an, Anhui, began to sports in Suzhou with his sick wife in Suzhou since 2017. It was 6 years of running. Fu Zhenyang wants to pay more than 200,000 yuan in debt, and also take care of the half -paralyzed wife. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; No need to do it one by one. The common point of these stories is that most of the heroes came from the countryside to the city to work hard, and they all encountered a huge twists and turns. They chose not to abandon or give up. They sparen the heavy pressure and endless test of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The direct reason they are difficult to add is to stay away from the family zone and bloodline bond. The strong and optimistic post -00 mother -in -law was ruthlessly launched by her mother -in -law, and more situations had to come to a big city to make a living in order to change the situation. Obviously, in the rural and family context, a person has difficulties, and everyone can set up a handle. You go to work, some people can help you see the child, you are ill, and someone will send you a hot meal to your family. This echoes your power to a large extent. But after coming to the city alone, all the &quot;reinforcements&quot; disappeared. In the scene of the neighbors &quot;do not know each other&quot;, you can only rely on yourself. The first thing you wake up every day is to rely on your loved ones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What they encountered is a substantial &quot;atomicization&quot;. As the experts say, social atomicization mainly refers to the process of changes in social connection status during the change of the unit system. It is mainly manifested by the weakening of personal connection and the alienation of individuals and the public world. And these daily busy situations are the actual portrayal of &quot;post -units&quot; and lonely individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They are actually in a lonely island, is isolated and helpless, and they are not even qualified to fall down -Yihe is the most worried that once they are gone, what should their sons do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Earning money and companionship are important and cannot be given up, but how to do both is a problem. Obviously, it is difficult for them to enter a &quot;regular unit&quot; in the secular sense and check in nine to five places. Even if they have such ability, they need to take care of themselves and cannot take care of their loved ones. Moreover, almost no unit allows employees to bring dolls or wives to work. Whether it is an enterprise&#39;s system or order, they will say &quot;no&quot; to this situation. After all, the employer does not have this obligation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fortunately, they found places to live in the flexible employment field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the realistic situation of the bone, the &quot;dilemma&quot; hanging on their heads forced them to find another law. The rise of platform employment and freelance has given them great hope. This is a way of working that can be freely controlled without punching in. It can be said that the Internet economy, including the takeaway economy, provides the final guarantee for such people. Behind this is actually a new idea that society opens to help solve the practical difficulties of a crowd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For this group, this is the only way they break the state of &quot;atomicization&quot; and get out of the predicament. Only those who are desperate to fight doom and hardship can find this difficult but quite solid path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the other hand, those wandering people with the children &quot;on the road&quot; also set an example for the children to persist in and glow in adversity. Children who have this process of life can also read the true meaning of life, and they will also be sensible earlier than their peers. A recent video video shows that a mother with a paralyzed lower limb in Yan&#39;an in Shaanxi accidentally fell when she was paralyzed on the wheelchair, and her 4 -year -old son tried his best to raise his mother again and again. On November 14, Li Yuanyuan released a video of the three -year -old daughter, Yu Er to help brush the bowl, and once again triggered discussion among netizens. Netizens directly called the little girl &quot;the smile was too cured.&quot; Hardness is also the best tutor. I am convinced that those who flew to the streets with their children have also had the psychological construction that cultivated children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When we explore the social assistance mechanism to protect the group, we should also see that mortals grit their teeth and carry the burden of a family, and support the extraordinary significance of a beloved loved ones. This narrative seems to be sporadic, loose, atypical, but also converges a lively sample that confronts uncertainty and unsatisfactory, becomes a society that is &quot;atomicized &quot;The indispensable force in the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成长的烦恼：中国电子竞技20年观察]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261254]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-25 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/t1g2je6q32xcmpwjvlgvou4ntf4yhCllLagsce.png &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1598 &quot;&quot; height = &quot;915&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.cms/medias/i/i MAGE/23/11/22/T1G2je6q32XCMPWJVLGVOU4NTF4YHCLLLLAGISce. png &quot;data-key =&quot; 259255 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Lu Junjie/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Household registration &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In 2002, 258315 fires occurred in China, causing 2393 people to die. However, the fire of the blue -speed Internet cafe that occurred in Beijing College Road on June 16, which caused 25 people, was undoubtedly the most discussed by public opinion that year and also caused the largest follow -up impact. All the Internet cafes in Beijing were closed after the accident, and then the Internet cafes across the country joined the rectification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Juvenile, arson, Internet cafes, video games ... A series of keywords that are called &quot;the most serious minor crime since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, almost overnight the mainstream public opinion of the society against electronics overnight The anger of the game has intensified to the maximum value. In the next two years, relevant departments have issued multiple regulations to strengthen the standardized management of Internet cafes. This directly led to Li Xiaofeng, a fanatic &quot;StarCraft&quot; player in Ruzhou, Henan at that time, could not find an Internet cafe that could play games for a while. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;E -sports&quot; has become a proprietary term at this time, and it has become a new entertainment industry that cannot be ignored globally. &quot;Important component of strategy. However, for Chinese society that has just joined the WTO and even looks strange to the Internet, e -sports is not only strange, but also because it is associated with the game, it also looks quite negative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At that time, China held a positive attitude towards e -sports, with a batch of elite elites in the literary system, and more of a group of ignorant young people with pure love. The former is Gao and Widow, and the latter is not serious. Based on common interests, the two groups formed a wonderful resonance in the same time and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to prove that they started to launch an impact on the champion, Ma Tianyuan and Weichi Di won the first WCG &quot;StarCraft&quot; project in South Korea in 2001, wearing a five -star red flag in Seoul Deeds, the little earth shocked their hometown and the people who had seen related news at the time -including the later WCG World Championship, Li Xiaofeng, who was still studying in Ruzhou at the time, they learned that playing games actually actually played games. There are also competitions, and they can compete for the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The TV station began to have e -sports programs, which introduced game culture, e -sports events and players, and also broadcast some events from time to time. From 2002 to 2003, the &quot;Game East and West&quot; of Tourism Satellite TV, Shanghai Satellite TV&#39;s &quot;Game Player&quot;, and &quot;E-sports World&quot; of CCTV Sports Channel successively launched, and quickly became the top fist products on their respective channels. Many people&#39;s understanding of e -sports -this is a brain activity based on video games that emphasize competition, honor, professionalism, and teamwork that emphasizes competition, honor, professionalism, and team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Against the background of such a major environment and at the same time, the fire of the stars everywhere, e -sports was listed as the 99th sports competition project by the State General Administration on November 18, 2003 - The household registration was resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The mainstream games or their prototypes of the later e -sports pattern have also appeared before this time. At that time, &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Anti -Terrorism Elite&quot; were the mainstream e -sports projects at that time; &quot;Warcraft 3&quot; released in July 2002 will become the new mainstream after a short time; a player named EUL uses &quot;Warcraft 3&quot; 3 The attached map editor produced a battle map called Defence of the Antients &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (&quot;Defense Relics&quot;) &lt;/span>;. Called DOTA. At that time, the map that seemed very simple at the time will hatch a new type of game in the short after, and two games that support the global e -sports, &quot;DOTA2&quot; and &quot;League of Legends&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The previous work &quot;Flash Dot Action&quot; of &quot;Armed Assault&quot; was released in 2001. This military simulation game developed by a Czech Studio and officially released in mainland China for a period of time is to pursue a high degree of truth. The operation is extremely complicated, resulting in a mediocre market response. However, it won a group of military enthusiasts. One of the enthusiasts named Brandon Green &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti;&quot; (Brandon Greene) &lt;/span>; This game made a &quot;Battle Royale&quot; battle map. In it, dozens of people will be dropped into a map, killing each other until the last person won -he later put this game into the game he participated in the development &quot; Jedi Survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This opening looks incomplete, but it is not bad -if no accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Forbidden broadcast order &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; At 14:00 on September 25, 2023, CCTV Sports Channel broadcast the Hangzhou Asian Games e -sports project &quot;Glory of the King&quot; Asian Games version of the Chinese team and the Thai team. In the end, the Chinese team defeated the Thailand 2-0 to advance to the final. At this time, the last time the e -sports event appeared on the Shangxing Satellite TV channel on Mainland China, it has passed nearly 20 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The successful account has not brought any visible policy support or funding for Chinese e -sports. Compared with the official management method of other sports projects, e -sports can be said to be unattended -until 2004 until 2004 On April 12, 2014, less than half a year after the official becoming a sports competition project, the management department issued the &quot;Notice of Broadcasting for Broadcasting Computer Online Game Program&quot;, which stipulated that after May 1 of that year, including &quot;E -sports World&quot;, All video game -related programs across the country&#39;s open TV channels are stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most of these programs have set a brilliant viewing record before stopping the broadcast. Taking &quot;Game East and West&quot; as an example, since the broadcast on July 28, 2002, it has taken the top spot in tourism satellite TV for a long time. Users who watch this show every day have reached about 4 million. The show group received hundreds of enthusiastic audience letters from all over the country every week, and some people packed five -yuan banknotes in the envelope to encourage the program team to make the show. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Yang, a senior e -sports practitioner and the author of &quot;History of Chinese E -sports&quot;, believes that e -sports had a very good mass foundation in China at the time, and the blow to the ban on broadcasting policies was quite serious. The most critical media link in the realization of e -sports has been blocked directly. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The ban on broadcasting policy has actually left a certain space. Paid channels such as &quot;Game Storm&quot; appear. However, obviously, this knife is cut off, the audience market driven by e -sports skills is greatly limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/acahxccfztjrmvp58xdbukhoamww9oubcmomux&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;626&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/acahxccfztjrmvp58xdbukhoamw9oubcmomoxp7.jpg =&quot; 259240 &quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; December 21, 2003, Zhengzhou, the first CS (&quot; Anti-Terrorist Elite &quot;) contest in Zhengzhou, players played the game &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; ( Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; E -sports was almost only one of the business routes proved to be available at the time -like traditional sports, it was sold to sell TV broadcast rights by competition to attract the title, and attracted the names. Sponsorship and advertising are also the classic model of traditional sports commercialization that made Korean e -sports that have developed less than 10 years. Of course, no one can ensure that the Chinese e -sports set can be achieved with this model, but no one knows how other roads are at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Yang believes that, in addition to the realization of monetization in survival, whether e -sports programs can be broadcast on national channels such as CCTV, which can be broadcast on the TV channel. Great different. Even today, even if there are dazzling live broadcast and video communication platforms, as long as CCTV broadcasts e -sports programs, it will still have a different impact. &quot;Advertisers will always calculate its actual monetization ability and influence. For example, why does Nafei take the subscription system? Why is it not enough for selling advertisements? Because the amount and influence of the Internet is not too large enough You can feed the entire system. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; Metapleration &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Today, after 20 years of successful hukou, Chinese e -sports has basically solved the problem of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, this road is quite difficult to go. Chinese e -sports practitioners have been forced to explore the way that no one has passed from the beginning. Perhaps God will open another window when closing a door. In 2004, the P2P streaming broadcast technology began to appear in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Using limited bandwidth to ensure the maximum of the video playback P2P live technology, it has almost become the core channel for e -sports. Of course, this channel is far less influential as TV, but it is worse than not. It can be said that the entire generation of e -sports audiences watch various events through the P2P video live platform and witness the Sky Li Xiaofeng and the WNV team to become a world champion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although there are also a lot of viewers, the traffic did not find an effective way of monetization during this period, and few people in the entire e -sports industry could see money. In 2005, Li Xiaofeng held a salary of 1,800 yuan a month at the club and became the world&#39;s top competition top game project championship. reward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Next is the crackdown of the 2008 financial crisis. The sponsors who had not put the e -sports field in the field of e -sports had been withdrawn, and the event was suspended, the budget was reduced, and the sponsorship was recovered. Next, the club&#39;s layoffs and dissolution were disbanded, and practitioners began to find another way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The final life of gaming is a new way at that time -bringing goods. After 2010, the basic conditions of the goods have been available: the first generation of e -sports audiences have gradually entered the society and have paid income; the habits of online shopping networks have begun to popularize; video websites have risen and live broadcast platforms appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Yang has deeply participated in this link to realize the attention of e -sports content. At the beginning, they tried to sell games related to playing games, mouses, headphones and other accessories, but these things were consumed very slowly, and the repurchase rate of the online store was very unsatisfactory -until they started selling a snack, meat muffin. &quot;It is very cheap, the cost is about one dollar, and the profit margin can reach 20%-30%.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In addition to physical goods, it can also bring virtual goods. Many page games have also followed the traffic of the e -sports circle, and they are quite generous, like the page game &quot;Fairy Road&quot; and even announced that 70%of their income is divided into promotion channels. From players like Li Xiaofeng, to the anchor of &quot;Star Boys&quot; Huang Xudong, they have become the beneficiaries of this model. However, it was not easy to take this step that year. When Li Xiaofeng announced the cooperation with &quot;Fairy&quot;, it once caused a lot of criticism in the circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the sound of controversy, page games and meat muffins have successfully saved the difficult e -sports industry. After a part of the video explanation, the tasting page game is successful or the small snacks such as the selling of meat and the meat were successful, and the well -known players in active or retired began to learn. In 2014, there were enthusiastic netizens who specifically counted the online store data of the former &quot;League of Legends&quot; team leader &quot;Ruofeng&quot;, and believed that his monthly profitability was estimated to be around 800,000 yuan. The income of the online store directly marked the clear value for the Internet celebrity players or the commentators, so the news of the most fierce stages of burning money on the live broadcast platform, the news of various live broadcast platforms to sign up tens of millions of yuan to sign the e -sports anchor began to spread continuously out. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The era of manufacturer &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; It can make e -sports just explored the realization path around 2012 to become a huge industry with a revenue of more than 100 billion yuan after 10 years. Pork loose cakes and live broadcast rewards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On December 4, 2010, Tencent launched the &quot;Tencent Game Competitive Platform&quot;, TGA. Many leagues that have been hatched after this platform are more famous than it, such as CFPL CFP, &quot;League of Legends&quot; event LPL, and KPL of &quot;Glory of the King&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tencent&#39;s starting to make e -sports also means that the game manufacturer has emerged in person to make a new model of the event. This new model also caters to the marketing of a new generation of games. In the era of games such as &quot;Counter -Strikes&quot; and &quot;Warcraft 3&quot;, game manufacturers can basically take advantage of the game copy to let go of the matter, and it is difficult for e -sports events to bring the follow -up interests to manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But online games such as &quot;League of Legends&quot; and &quot;Glory of the King&quot; are different. They are originally available for free download and play. Making money depends on the additional products in the game, such as character skin skin . In this way, game sales have become a process of being stretched infinitely and demand is constantly being created. Since then, e -sports has the function of bringing goods for game manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhuang Minghao, a senior e -sports practitioner, believes that the pattern of a game manufacturer personally dominated his own game e -sports events is almost inevitable. &quot;Even if a strong third party appears, it will slowly change slowly He has talked about the first party. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Of course, the focus of the manufacturer&#39;s own focus will inevitably be ambiguous. Do you want to do the business business or do game marketing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But this problem is not important 10 years ago. Regardless of the purpose of the manufacturer, they may still be the most motivated person to make the event -e -sports began to usher in the era of manufacturers. The third party has been fighting one after another, and the melee continues. Any manufacturer will spend some money to engage in a game, and then pull a few clubs to come to the Caotai team of the game. It is also during this period, leagues such as LPL began to organize club alliances, cancel the establishment of a seat bidding system, set off offline competitions into the Bird&#39;s Nest Stadium, and promote the regional main away system ... A decent e -sports league is What looks like, there is a template. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; LPL has become the global and influential e -sports league. The industrial scale and social influence of Chinese e -sports have also increased the maximum growth during this period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Pan Jie, CEO of LGD Club, the quality of e -sports content is one of the core values ​​of whether the vitality of the game can continue. Under such underlying logic, manufacturers will inevitably do their best to ensure the fairness of the event, do a good job of the role of a large -scale e -sports alliance manager, and attract more sponsors and fans to this e -sports alliance to ensure that the entire e -sports content is guaranteed to the entire e -sports content healthy growth. &quot;Manufacturers lead the competitions more long -lasting, more standardized, and more professional than the previous third parties, and can also ensure the rights and interests of the participants. Players, clubs, fans, media, sponsors, and game brands can get what they want. This is a good thing for the e -sports industry ecology itself. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; Cake &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; It is really good under the big tree, but there are many people in the cold, but there are always quilts. Denned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The &quot;2022 China E -sports Industry Report&quot; released by the China Soundrum Association E -sports Commission shows that China&#39;s e -sports industry revenue was 144.503 billion yuan in 2022. However, 81.52%of the revenue of 14.4503 billion yuan is the income of the game itself. Among the remaining 18%, 15.28%are live revenue of e -sports content; the remaining points are basically divided by clubs and events. If it does not count the game income, the actual income scale of the e -sports industry is about 25.8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The money of the big head seems to make game manufacturers earn, and the manufacturer may not be willing to divide it again. So this problem became sharp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The income structure of manufacturers&#39; earnings is very reasonable to Pan Jie&#39;s view. As for whether the manufacturer really does the event or only wants to rely on the marketing market, the two may not be contradictory. &quot;Only by more standardized, healthier, and more benign e -sports events, can we help game manufacturers and upstream and downstream industries of e -sports to make cakes together, so as to continue to realize more high -quality content and hotspots.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p >; The club&#39;s ability to make money has indeed risen with the influence of e -sports events. Zhuang Minghao remembers that from 2013-2014, the Internet company wants to buy a LPL club uniform. There are still not many clubs that really make money by e -sports. The business of traditional sports projects around the competition and club operations obviously has not really done it. In 2021, Pan Yibin, general manager of EDG E -sports Club, revealed in an interview that there are currently no more than 5 e -sports clubs that can achieve self -profit and loss. According to the &quot;China E-sports Industry Report from January to June 2023&quot; issued by the China Soundrum Association E-Games, as of June 2023, there were 191 e-sports clubs that can be queried by China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Xudong believes that the commercial potential of domestic e -sports has not been completely excavated. &quot;I always want to ask, traditional sports such as basketball, football or including table tennis can be with e -sports today. Do you think that basketball and football can fight. Which of the remaining items can fight with e -sports projects? But it is strange that although some traditional sports projects, although the traffic cannot be spelled, its income is much higher than that of e -sports . &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Although the environment has improved significantly 20 years ago, social recognition is still a problem.&quot; I still think you are unreasonable, young people may recognize, but for people who have some social resources Said that he was actually not as high as traditional sports in this thing. &quot;Huang Xudong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/vbhcefsdmr4LFNjebubf97tzpeodjijldsxmbi3.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;497&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/vbhcefsdmr4lfnjebubf97tzpeodjijldsxmbi3.jpg&quot; data- &quot;&lt;259242&quot;>; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;&quot; Star Boys &quot;Sun Yifeng and Huang Xudong &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (provided by the interviewee/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt; H4>; Life &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Even if all aspects of the competition system led by the manufacturer make money, they are all happy, but they still have to face another problem: there are more than one game manufacturer, and the life span of the game is inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What game will become the next ruling -level e -sports project, every ring in the industry -manufacturers, competition operations, clubs, players, anchors, or commentary There may be a lot of doors, but in the final analysis, &quot;looking at life is really looking at life.&quot; Huang Xudong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For example, with the &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Warcraft 3&quot;, such as &quot;Blizzard 3&quot; in the middle of the day, I won&#39;t think of a map editor attached to &quot;Warcraft 3&quot;. . And the sheep sword &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Guinsoo) &lt;/span>; and ice frog &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, kb2312, stkaiti;&quot; >;（Icefrog）&lt;/span>;还在免费为爱发电、不断更新《魔兽争霸3》里的DOTA地图时，不会想到他们二人后来一个去了拳头游戏做《英雄联盟》，一个去了维尔福做《DOTA2》。暴雪更不会想到，一个自家游戏孵化出的伟大创意，诞生了两个伟大游戏，最后跟自己一点关系都没有。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下一个统治级的电竞游戏项目，是让当下大部分电竞从业者一刻都不敢松懈的存在，哪怕它还没出现。今天中国最具人气的两个电竞项目游戏，《英雄联盟》于2009年发布，《王者荣耀》于2015年发布，它们站在舞台中央的时间比之前的几乎所有热门电竞游戏都要久，位于第二梯队的《DOTA2》和《CSGO》捆一块，收入也赶不上前二者中的任何一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这当然离不开游戏厂商在赛事运营上的精心布局，厂商主导赛事的模式，以及赛事运营水平的提高，有效延续了这个时代很多热门电竞项目的寿命，并且可能也抬高了新游戏项目改朝换代的门槛。潘婕对此评价，“其实还是因为最近出来的可电竞化的游戏项目没有那么优秀，尚不足以对现在的热门项目造成冲击，这就倒逼新的电竞项目必须拿出新的想法来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/O7IperkYCoU0x1xf9UxIr9uEz8XHtcnqtQYWqek3.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月26日，在杭州亚运会电子竞技《王者荣耀》亚运版本决赛中，中国队以2比0战胜马来西亚队，获得冠军&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天挑起中国电竞大梁的这些游戏，收入几乎都在下滑。普通玩家感觉《英雄联盟》排位时间变长，《王者荣耀》排位赛机器人明显变多，就是一个不太乐观的信号。在宏观的数据上，2022年电竞游戏收入1178.02亿元，同比下降15.96%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年横空出世、曾被电竞圈寄予厚望的《绝地求生》因为国内版号问题一直纠缠不清，手机端版本《和平精英》直到2019年才发布，也并没有如期待中那般打开新局面，从2021年起《和平精英》的收入便呈现下滑趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;旧王的没落只是时间问题，在新的接班游戏到来之前，“只能寄希望于没落的时间延长了。”庄明浩感慨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;沙特&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;有时候没落是润物细无声的，也有时候没落是电闪雷鸣的。比如《星际争霸2》，随着2023年1月24日中国服务器的关闭，厂商在中国大陆市场终止所有运营，正常渠道登录的中国玩家全部消失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;讽刺的是，差不多半个月后，2023年2月13日，赛前完全不被看好的中国选手李培楠&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Time）&lt;/span>;在《星际争霸2》IEM卡托维兹站总决赛中，以4-1的比分战胜韩国选手Maru，夺得世界冠军。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;指望厂商做好赛事也有不确定性，厂商靠谱也就罢了，万一厂商发疯呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以潘婕希望未来专业的厂商赛事和高规格的第三方赛事能实现有效结合，“明年俄罗斯喀山未来运动会以及沙特利雅得电竞世界杯的落地，也标志着高规格的第三方赛事将重新回到舞台中央。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个有史以来最大的第三方逐渐浮出水面。 2023年10月23日，在国际足联主席因凡蒂诺和正在沙特联赛踢球的球星C罗的簇拥下，沙特王储兼首相穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼宣布，沙特将启动一年一度的电子竞技世界杯&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Esports World Cup）&lt;/span>;，首届赛事将于2024年夏季在利雅得举办。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位据说是FPS游戏《使命召唤》老玩家的年轻首相明确提出了一个目标：“电子竞技世界杯是沙特阿拉伯成为全球首屈一指的游戏和电子竞技中心的旅程中自然而然的下一步。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，沙特主办的年度电竞赛事Gamers8开幕。到2023年，它已经成了全球奖金池最大的电竞赛事，被中国网友戏称为“石油杯”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然这个第三方空前强大，但游戏厂商主导赛事的格局也不见得一夜之间会发生什么改变，一轮新的博弈必然发生。黄旭东便发现，两届Gamers8，一直没有《英雄联盟》的身影。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;游戏厂商做赛事固然已经证明是一条相对成功的路径，但黄旭东认为不见得每家厂商都有这个心力，面对做不做赛事的选择时，厂商的心态也很复杂. “有些厂商想自己干，也有些厂商就想把游戏做好，至于电子竞技赛事，可以去合作。如果真有个像沙特这样的第三方，干得很好，投入也很大，厂商也不用花钱，甚至能在里面挣钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黄旭东觉得沙特人最大的优势或许就是，电竞作为国家影响力战略的一部分，他们根本不指望靠这个赛事本身赚钱，而是想要每年沙特电竞世界杯开打时涌来的几十万游客，以及游戏公司在本国落地等更大的齿轮，“又有钱，又砸得起，又不要短期收益，他要长期，他要2030&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（指沙特2030愿景）&lt;/span>;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;假以时日，谁也不确定沙特会不会永远只是个第三方。 2022年沙特穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼基金会MiSK还通过旗下游戏开发公司EGDC收购了日本游戏公司SNK 96.18%的股份，从而掌握了知名格斗游戏《拳皇》的版权。这两年，来自沙特的资本对游戏制作厂商、电竞赛事运营公司的投资动作不断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;鸡蛋&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;如今，中国的电竞选手们起码不需要再像当年李晓峰和苏昊那代选手一般，为了省钱来练习而靠吃水煎包或鸡蛋饼过日子了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于29岁的《英雄联盟》退役选手阿兰来说，他出道的时候也不需要像过去那般千回百转才找到一家开在网吧里的随时可能倒下的俱乐部.像他这样有天赋的选手在游戏积分或排位崭露头角后，很自然就会被俱乐部接触，加入战队就有了4000元底薪加包食宿的待遇，基本能心无旁骛地开启专业选手的生活。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当阿兰发现自己年龄不占优势、天赋和实力也没有高到足以让他走向更高台阶时，他在俱乐部的建议下从分析师助教做起，开始从选手到教练Transformation.如今他在一家青训营做教练，为更高级别的赛事培养新鲜血液。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;青训营无意间还产生了另一种功能：很多自以为有电竞天赋或者根本分不清打游戏和电竞概念的孩子，进青训营按职业选手的方式训练、生活，并见识到了真正的天地后，发现自己不是这块料时，老实回家上学了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“今天至少在（电竞）行业有很多从业者，你不至于担心明天没有饭吃是吧？今天做选手，明天还可以转到相关的一些赛道上去，上下游的厂商也在变多……虽然可能大家都活得很辛苦，但是至少有更多分工对吧？”庄明浩觉得，一个发展不过20年的行业能有这般光景，已经很不容易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比起不用吃水煎包和鸡蛋饼更重要的是，行业的巨变和震荡变少了，新一代电竞从业者的选择和退路变多了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像“星际老男孩”黄旭东这样的老一代从业者依然不敢懈怠。事实证明他是对的，他作为主播玩了10年的《星际争霸2》，说停服就停服，“从第一天开始就觉得我们做的项目并不是一个特别顶流的项目，所以我们危机感很重。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以这些年除了主播，像MCN主播孵化、网红经纪、游戏广告投放、游戏制作，乃至跟电竞毫无关系的直播带货，甚至医美，“星际老男孩”都有涉及。 “我们尝试过很多事情，有些东西也失败了，但我们永远还是信奉鸡蛋不要放在同一个篮子里。”黄旭东说。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;伴随着大众对健康饮食的生活方式的追求，中国人的饮食结构正在往多元化发展，无论是老式还是新中式，抑或是欧式和日式，面包作为烘焙食品的一大分支，正在经历从点心到主食或代餐食品的转变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一方面，趋向饱和的中国烘焙市场竞争激烈，市场规模仍在扩大，未来烘焙赛道更新要求提升。比如零糖产品消费成风，代糖需求引起烘焙产业链的巨大变动，提升工艺、更新设备、创新产品和销售渠道等将成为烘焙行业面临的新挑战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;另一方面，消费者对烘焙食品已形成定期购买习惯，沿海地区以及一、二线城市的消费能力较强，其中女性用户和中青年成为拉动烘焙食品消费的主力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;烘焙食品在满足消费者日常生活需求的同时，作为一种文化符号、身份标志以及社交货币占据大众视线，像“citywalk+咖啡+贝果”的组合已成为当代年轻人潮流的生活方式之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;消费潮流的更新迭代，背后是一种集体行动的自我强化——这导致了烘焙行业一轮又一轮的洗牌。前人退场，后人登台，烘焙市场呈现冰火两重天之势：“闭店潮”与“融资热”共存。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;行业大洗牌，不变的是“烘焙刺客”仍然屹立不倒，悬在消费者头顶的达摩克利斯之剑仍未消失.据业内人士透露，某些烘焙高价关键词，每出现一个就加5块钱。那么，年轻人对此买账吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在日本学者三浦展《第4消费时代：共享经济，让人变幸福的大趋势》所提及，“第4消费时代”的趋向是简约、现实、低价和低消费欲望，消费价值观出现社会、地方和共享倾向，这种消费特征似乎在中国年轻消费群体中初露倪端。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;面对“烘焙刺客”，他们拒绝被“割韭菜”，选择更为简单的预制烘焙产品，拒绝被黄牛加价，他们把目光投向社区面包房，线上开团抢面包；拒绝大排长龙，居家手作享受烘焙乐趣与美味，有些高级烘焙玩家甚至开始养酵种，打造烘焙的精神趣味。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“知道”跟你谈谈，当面包变得越发吃不起，年轻人会如何应对。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/12945c742d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

The popular flying saucer exploration and the mystery of aliens in big cities will be blown to me when I graduated from junior high school.那个夏天我格外着迷UFO和外星人，在文汇书店看了很多外星人的书，又看地方电视台里寻找幽灵和外星人的节目，我走路时常常突兀停下，往天上望，觉得天上一定有什么也在望着我。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有个傍晚，我抬头时终于看到了UFO。那是两个贴在一起的火球，呈橘色，在高空中匀速飞行，飞行器的尾部看起来在喷火。 “你们终于来接我了。”我欣喜地跟着天上的飞行器一直走了下去，完全忘了自己身在陌生的城市，直到它完全消失。后来父母找到迷路的我时，我什么也没说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月，我在成都郫都参加第81届世界科幻大会，脑子里常浮现出那个UFO，我想，在场任何一位科幻迷都不会嘲笑我吧。科幻大会真是热闹的几天，成都科学馆最多的元素就是熊猫和刘慈欣，我读的科幻少，但采访中冒出越来越强烈的好奇：为什么恰恰是科幻，为什么在成都，为什么科幻崛起发生在近十年的中国？与此同时，我像被唤醒了孩童时期对宇宙的模糊情感，是啊，我们一直在猜测世界和宇宙的真相。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人们对科幻作家的期待，也来自科幻作家群体在以往创造的历史，他们在作品中对未来的想象在不断兑现。科幻大会的现场采访结束后，我在离开成都前去了朋友的新书店，成都过去几年中新书店涌现，这家还在试营业的书店叫“白读”，6位创始人里有3位是做web3的。店里第一排大书墙比较特别，非常流畅，先是技术，再到机器,再到互联网、人工智能，整排书籍的尽头，是一列科幻文学作品——关于未来网络社会的想象,里面只有两本中国科幻作家的书。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;听到我这次出差是采访科幻大会时，做web3的女生拉着我问了半小时，直到我不得不赶去机场乘机。今年她和伙伴们在湾区的一场会议上，来自全球的前沿网络技术人员纷纷表达了对AI接下来即将改变人类命运的恐惧。她近乎急切地不断问我，人工智能已经势不可挡了，为什么中国最顶级的科幻作家没有指明人类社会即将发生的深刻变化？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可是，为什么会对一种文学类型提出这样的要求？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;应该没有任何其他文学类型会被赋予这样的期待了。看起来，这几位网络从业者知道技术接下来会创造出什么，但并不清楚技术最终将把人类引向何方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;越来越多的文学论坛，讨论新技术之下的写作和人存在的意义，ChatGPT带来的恐慌是我没想到的，“前面几次工业革命创造的都是物质，这次创造的是精神。”科幻作家、就职于新华社的韩松在采访中说，“更早以前大机器出现，人感觉到要失业，核武器出现，感觉到人类会被灭绝，但是这次不一样。”这更像是一种人类的物种危机，可能被更智慧的生物所更替。如果这就是演化的一部分呢？指明演化规律，也实在不能算悲观。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一切真是让人好奇。在郫都的科幻大会，我还是会走着走着突然伫足抬头望，乐不可支。对外星生物来说，见到地球上这群开科幻大会的家伙，一颗颗望着它们的大圆脑袋，也会吓一跳吧，“这群两眼炯炯有神的外星生物，又要怎么写我们了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我们需要怎样的图书馆？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261216]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-25 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On the one hand, there is news about the decline of paper books.

Many people felt that she was not worth it and criticized her for wasting her quota at Tsinghua University. Marianne also admitted that she did not expect to transform from a historian to a full-time astrologer today. However, she believes that career choices should be based on one&#39;s own interests and abilities, and should not be restricted by traditional career boundaries. You should be brave enough to try and find your own career value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She spent 5 years studying astrology and worked as an astrologer for 2 years. Her customer base is mainly young people, who found her through friends&#39; introductions or Internet searches. In the past two years, she has done very well, receiving nearly a thousand customers, and her monthly income has just exceeded 30,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To judge her choice, the first question to be faced is: Is it illegal to use fortune telling, astrology, tarot cards, or other methods that claim to be predictive to predict people&#39;s fortune and destiny? This question is simple, but the answer is more complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what form of fortune telling, whether it is illegal or not depends on whether the specific behavior is illegal. Courts generally give a certain degree of respect to traditional Chinese Feng Shui, Zhouyi and other cultures and customs, and do not make scientific or superstitious judgments. Instead, they regard them as legitimate consulting services. As long as the fees are within the normal range, they are regarded as normal labor expenses. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The foundation of Chinese fortune-telling is the &quot;Book of Changes&quot;. Telling people&#39;s fortunes based on the Four Pillars, Five Elements and Eight Diagrams seems to be regarded as the research, discussion and practice of traditional culture. According to a kind of saying, some money must be paid for these leaks, otherwise it will be more detrimental to the fortune teller. So, if you receive dozens, hundreds, or even hundreds of yuan, the person receiving the money will be happy, but the person giving the money will not matter. , both parties are consensual, and there is no fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams are allowed, birth dates are allowed, and divination and burning turtle shells are allowed, then even though horoscopes, crystal balls, and Tarot cards are passed down from foreign countries, they are still not illegal and can be regarded as An advisory or entertainment. Take this astrologer who graduated from Tsinghua University as an example. His current monthly income is just over 30,000 yuan. It may not have been that much before. His two-year income is estimated to be only 200,000-400,000 yuan. With a thousand customers, the average income per person is two to three hundred yuan. . This amount is obviously not illegal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if a fortune teller pretends to be a god or a mage, commits fraud, fraud, extortion and other illegal acts, or defrauds money by exaggerating or falsely advertising, or charges a large amount, it is considered a crime. Illegal conduct. The court will determine that this kind of &quot;fortune-telling&quot; is unjust enrichment and is not a legitimate reason for obtaining benefits under the law. At the least, it will apply the civil law&#39;s unjust enrichment to return the property and return the unjust enrichment to the injured person. At worst, it will involve a criminal offense. . For example, using tarot cards, crystal balls, astrology and other methods to introduce physical, mental and spiritual fraud courses is an out-and-out crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the legal issues are complex, they are well-founded. A more difficult question to answer is, how should we view the rise of this type of profession? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern society is developing at a fast pace, interpersonal relationships are tense, and it is full of opportunities and challenges, but it is also accompanied by great uncertainties, such as the rise and fall of stocks, profit and loss of business, rising or unfinished real estate prices, and so on. There is the eternal topic of good health. Faced with these complex uncertainties, there is always an indescribable uneasiness permeating the hearts of contemporary people. Many people believe that their own destiny is not completely within their control. There is a supernatural power that affects the direction of their destiny. People do not accept this as their fate with peace of mind. They desire to control their lives and seek certainty. There are also some people who have achieved great success. Looking back at the past, their fate is full of coincidences. They feel that many things are beyond human control. While thanking God for his blessing, they will naturally worship this power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, religion and fortune telling became the way for them to seek spiritual comfort. Various fortune-telling and predictions are how they seek comfort and certainty from this unknowable power. For modern people, fortune telling is relatively familiar, but tarot cards and crystal balls are more advanced because they are rarely seen and come from foreign countries with exotic customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are degrees of distinction in seeking various fortune tellings. Some people don&#39;t necessarily believe in the results of fortune telling, but just treat it as entertainment and seek psychological comfort. For example, if you want to share something tomorrow, or conduct a live broadcast, or take an exam, you can find someone online and spend dozens or hundreds of dollars to tell your fortune, or look at a crystal ball or tarot cards, and get a As a result, you can have fun. If the result is good, take it as a positive psychological hint to yourself, and don&#39;t take it personally if it&#39;s not good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of this astrologer who graduated from Tsinghua University, astrology is not just prediction, but a tool to help people better understand themselves and life. She said: &quot;Astrology has allowed me to see the bigger world and give me a deeper understanding of human nature. Every time I see a client feel relieved or inspired by my help, I feel very satisfied.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;There is some truth in what she said. Astrologers are actually providing psychological massage to a certain extent. An excellent astrologer understands the ancient astronomy and mythology related to astrology itself, but also involves philosophy and psychology. Only in this way can he provide comprehensive psychological support to his clients. This is obviously the advantage of a historian as an astrologer. This is similar to traditional Chinese fortune telling. Three scholars asked the fortune teller about the results of the imperial examination. The fortune teller raised a finger: one of them passed the exam; only one failed; and none of the three passed. One finger corresponds to three results. This is a kind of deception, but it is also a psychological suggestion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, can these methods really bring long-term comfort to people? In fact, fortune telling is more of an escape. True courage is to maintain courage and determination after going through hardships, to find solutions and face uncertainty based on reason and courage. Turning to psychological counseling, psychotherapy and other methods to adjust your mentality and face reality is more reliable than fortune telling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
