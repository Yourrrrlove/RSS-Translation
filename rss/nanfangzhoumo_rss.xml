Li from Jiangxi Province listened to a friend&#39;s promise to transfer 300,000 yuan to him and asked him to help with the official establishment work of a certain unit. However, the work was not completed and the money was wasted. On December 4, Nandu reporters learned from the Jiangxi Higher People’s Court that Li sued the court for a refund, but the court rejected it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/d649f5470d6662846839430260e39d32.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;784&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/d649f5470d6662846839430260e39d32.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260717&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;According to case details disclosed by the Jiangxi Provincial Higher People’s Court, the plaintiff Li and the defendant Zhang are friends. In a certain conversation, Zhang said that he could help Li handle the formal establishment work of a certain unit. Subsequently, Li transferred 300,000 yuan to Zhang and entrusted him to handle it. After receiving the remittance, Zhang issued a &quot;receipt&quot; to Li and emphasized that if the transaction was not completed, a full refund would be issued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, because the work was not successfully handled, Zhang successively refunded 160,000 yuan to Li, but the remaining 140,000 yuan was never refunded. During this period, Zhang issued a &quot;Commitment&quot; to Li, promising to pay off the remaining money before the end of December 2020, but it was not fulfilled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li sued Zhang to the court, requiring Zhang to return the remaining fees and pay interest and legal fees, totaling more than 150,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The People&#39;s Court of Nanchang High-tech Zone held after trial that the plaintiff Li paid money in the hope of entering a certain unit to solve formal staffing work. The behavior involved in the case was an illegal request, and the resulting dispute was not a civil legal relationship. Li attempted to achieve his own goals through improper means. This behavior itself promoted unhealthy trends in society, disrupted social order, violated relevant laws and regulations of our country, and harmed social and public interests. The purpose and means of his behavior were illegal and should not be punished. Legal protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court rejected all Li’s claims. Li was dissatisfied and appealed, and the second instance upheld the original verdict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court reminded that our country’s laws stipulate that when entering into and performing a contract, the parties shall abide by laws and administrative regulations, respect social ethics, and shall not disrupt the social and economic order or harm the public interests of the society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[桂花人家]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261876]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;01.

The sweet-scented osmanthus is stained with dew, which makes it fresh and easy to fall off. It is not easy to damage the tree. If the sun comes out and dries the dew on the flowers, it will be difficult and very damaging to the tree. After people gathered around a large osmanthus tree and spread out their tents, they picked up their bamboo pens and knocked them on the branches covered with flowers. The osmanthus flowers on the tree fell like rain. The person responsible for holding the canopy should adjust the position in the direction of the falling sweet-scented osmanthus and insert the flowers into the canopy. It is understood that each tree can generally bloom 30 to 40 kilograms of sweet-scented osmanthus every year, and the market purchase price is 5 to 8 yuan per kilogram. Guihua Town currently has an osmanthus planting area of ​​70,000 acres, with a flower output of 2 million jins.

Unique and excellent crop varieties are the fruits of agricultural technology summarized by human beings through thousands of years of production practice. They are also an important carrier and witness of human agricultural civilization. The people of Guixiang have unique methods and methods for maintaining ancient osmanthus, collecting osmanthus, and cultivating nurseries. The whole process effectively protects the natural environment and fully reflects the cherishment of the land on which they depend for survival. In today&#39;s world of globalization, with the popularization of newly cultivated crop varieties, many traditional crops with regional characteristics are facing the crisis of extinction. Just as information technology has brought global cultural convergence, the popularization of hybrid and genetically modified technologies has also caused The convergence and simplification of crop varieties, the loss of species diversity and cultural richness, lurks a huge species crisis and cultural crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;11.

It was built only 9 years ago and has three buildings. All of them have been identified as Class D dangerous buildings. More than 300 households have been forced to rent houses or stay with relatives and friends for four consecutive years. It is still difficult to move back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Xinhua Viewpoint&quot; reporters learned from the investigation that the conversion of sheds into dangerous buildings exposed the loopholes in local supervision of housing construction safety. At present, Mingshui County is accelerating the demolition of dangerous buildings in the shantytown-renovated communities involved, and plans to complete the reconstruction before the end of 2024. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&quot;There were cracks in the wall in the second year after the move back.&quot; The relevant responsible persons have been taken compulsory measures in accordance with the law&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;This It didn’t work after the building was completed, and there were cracks in the walls the second year after we moved back. Then there were more and more problems until we left,&quot; said Liu Xiquan, a resident of the Harmony Home Community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some residents interviewed told reporters that the quality problems of the houses in the Harmony Home Community emerged very early. Some floors have seriously sunk, some have uneven floors with a height difference of more than 5 centimeters, and some can feel significant vibrations even when they stomp around the room. &quot;The government&#39;s supervision is not in place, so this &#39;bastard project&#39; actually passed the completion inspection.&quot; said a resident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter saw outside the Harmony Home Community that the entire community was surrounded by barbed wire and could not be entered, and no one could be seen inside. The community is divided into three buildings: A, B, and C. The first and second floors of Building A and B are commercial service areas, and the third to sixth floors are residential. The first floor of Building C is a commercial service area, and the second to sixth floors are residential areas. Residential.

In July 2019, after receiving reports from the public that there were quality problems in the buildings, Mingshui County commissioned Heilongjiang Coldland Building Research Institute and other third-party institutions to conduct safety appraisals on the community multiple times. The appraisal concluded that three buildings in the community were Class D dangerous buildings. , it is a construction quality accident and it is recommended to dismantle and rebuild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2021, the Mingshui County Public Security Bureau launched an investigation into the harmonious home dangerous building case and determined that the actual construction contractor and relevant supervisors were suspected of committing the crime of major engineering liability accidents, and have been subject to compulsory measures in accordance with the law, and Transferred to Mingshui County People&#39;s Procuratorate for review. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, the total construction area of ​​the Harmony Home Community is 20,991 square meters, the total investment is approximately 21.25 million yuan, and there are 331 households and businesses. The construction unit of the community is Suihua City Qinggang County Great Wall Construction Engineering Co., Ltd., and the supervision unit is Suihua City Supervision Company Mingshui Branch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Xiaoning, the head of Mingshui County, said that for the quality accident of the Harmony Home project, the main body of responsibility is Qinggang County Great Wall Construction Engineering Co., Ltd.; the development company Qinggang County Jianxing Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., and the construction unit Qinggang County Great Wall Construction Engineering A limited company is the subject of liability for compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2021, the Mingshui County Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee established an investigation team to investigate and collect evidence on the performance of relevant units and staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, it was found that the then director of the Mingshui County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, the director of the Quality Supervision Station, the person in charge of the supervision company, and the project supervision personnel had derelict in their duties. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;“The government quickly found people to identify dangerous buildings, but later failed to demolish them.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Originally The shantytown renovation project that benefited the people has now become a &#39;sad project.&#39;&quot; &quot;It has been more than four years since the dilapidated buildings have been demolished, let alone rebuilt.&quot; In the Harmony Home Community, some residents pointed to the uninhabited buildings. told reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2019, after the relevant departments of Mingshui County initiated the eviction of the residents of the Harmony Home Community, the demolition and resettlement subsidies were implemented in accordance with the shantytown reform policy. The party is responsible for the responsibility. While residents are waiting to be relocated back to their original places, temporary resettlement allowances of 4,800 yuan per year will be provided to residents, and businesses will be provided with annual suspension of production and business losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The government quickly found people to identify dangerous buildings, but later failed to demolish them.” Liu Xiquan said. Some relocated residents said they had visited the county Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau and other departments to learn about the situation over the past four years, but had not received a definite answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Finance has issued 101.03 million yuan in general bond funds to Mingshui County for the work of relieving dangerous buildings in the Harmony Home Community. This money has been received in September 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Hui, chief clerk of the Mingshui County Finance Bureau, said that in December 2021, because the demolition and reconstruction project of dangerous buildings in the Harmony Home Community had not yet started, in accordance with the &quot;Local Government General Debt Budget Management Measures&quot; issued by the Ministry of Finance, etc. According to relevant regulations, with the approval of the Standing Committee of the County People&#39;s Congress, the bond funds have been adjusted in the budget and have been used for public welfare expenditures such as local road reconstruction. After the budget adjustment, the county finance will support the continued implementation of the demolition and reconstruction of dangerous buildings. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;“I hope there will be no more problems and we can move back smoothly next year”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The interviewed Mingshui County cadres said that Due to the impact of the epidemic, as well as factors such as the lack of experience at the grassroots level in dealing with dangerous buildings, the long judicial process, and the lack of ability to do mass work, the reconstruction of dangerous buildings has been slow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Xiaoning said that because the development companies are temporarily unable to rebuild, the government has advanced funds to implement construction. Before starting the demolition, a compensation agreement, an entrustment agreement and a demolition application form should be signed with the residents and property owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I have never encountered anything like this.” Many grassroots cadres said frankly that handling the demolition and reconstruction of dilapidated buildings involves a large number of legal issues, and every step must be handled with caution, often requiring the government’s legal advisers, local judicial Government agencies, housing construction and other departments jointly study and conduct repeated demonstrations to ensure that the government&#39;s actions and procedures such as advance funds are legal and compliant. Due to insufficient understanding of judicial procedures and insufficient preparation for some preliminary requirements, the progress of reconstruction failed to meet people&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This dangerous building incident also exposed the shortcomings of the local authorities&#39; organizational capabilities and ability to do mass work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beginning in August this year, residents in the community were required to sign a compensation agreement, an entrustment agreement and a demolition application form; because the signature rate was not high enough, there was a situation where temporary resettlement fees were not paid if they did not sign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We cannot accept the resettlement fee without signing an agreement. This approach is unacceptable to us.” Some people said that the reconstruction design plan for Building C had not yet come out at that time, and it was unreasonable to sign an agreement without understanding the situation. In addition, since the new building requires a new fire escape and the installation of an elevator, some residents believe that the shared area will increase and are unwilling to sign the agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Recently, we have set up a special team to promptly respond to issues of concern to the masses and further strengthen communication.&quot; Zou Xiaoning said that the public area of ​​​​the new building does not exceed 30%, and the old building and the new building will be based on 1:1.1 The proportion of compensation to the residents was fully explained, and the signing of the agreement became smooth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jian said that the feasibility study preparation and project approval of the Harmony Home Dangerous Building Project have been completed, and construction drawing design is in progress. It is planned to start demolition of dangerous buildings before the end of December 2023, and start construction before the end of April 2024. The construction will be completed and the relocation will be realized by the end of December next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I hope there won’t be any more problems and we can move back smoothly next year.” Some community residents said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海底捞服务员跳“科目三”引争议：从“特色服务人设”到事件营销丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261874]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, &quot;Haidilao Waiter Jumps Subject Three&quot; has become popular on the Internet and continues to trigger heated discussions. First, &quot;Parents taking their children to eat Haidilao and complaining&quot; became a hot search topic: A Hangzhou mother took her children to Haidilao to eat. She bluntly said that she felt uncomfortable when she saw the waiter skipping &quot;Subject Three&quot; and posted a complaint, &quot;Why is this kind of thing so popular?&quot; It was disgusting to see the waiter squirming around.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If this Hangzhou mother only had aesthetic discomfort, then the conflict that occurred at a Haidilao restaurant in Huaian, Jiangsu Province on November 28 had even more serious consequences. A guest ordered a performance of &quot;Subject Three&quot; to celebrate his child&#39;s birthday. A guest at another table complained that the music was too loud and protested. The two sides immediately had a quarrel. In the end, the conflict escalated and almost led to a physical conflict. The police came to mediate. Live the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, in some Haidilao stores, as long as the customer says &quot;I want Subject 3&quot;, a &quot;professional waiter&quot; will come out to perform a magical dance and show off the flowers to the rhythmic and dynamic music. The dance of hands, waist twisting and hip swaying is the &quot;Subject Three Dance&quot; that has been popular on the short video platform for many years. Haidilao officials also said in response to &quot;Jiupai Finance&quot; that Haidilao has always encouraged store partners to carry out various innovations based on their own expertise and customer needs, and has established corresponding innovation incentive mechanisms. Store positions are paid on a piece-rate basis, and more work is more rewarding. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All of this can’t help but make people sigh. Nowadays, Haidilao’s catering services are increasingly tending to develop into “ancient dance banquets”. Customers already feel that “there is no fun at the banquet” just by eating. I hope &quot;Dance to cheer up&quot; or enjoy other special services, turning the matter of eating hot pot into &quot;Zhongming Dingshi&quot; and &quot;Han Xizai&#39;s Night Banquet&quot;. The positive encouragement from the store and the polar reactions from the audience have already explained many problems and deserve detailed analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the &quot;personality&quot; established by Haidilao can be said to be consistent, which is to provide thoughtful and considerate diversified special services to satisfy customers&#39; emotional value beyond their taste buds, so that in addition to eating here, they can also get other free services. &quot; Bring more happiness to customers”. The &quot;personality&quot; of this special service has repeatedly triggered a wave of imitation in the catering industry. &quot;God-like service&quot; has become Haidilao&#39;s most distinctive label. There is a saying in the public that &quot;you can&#39;t learn Haidilao&quot;, which shows the development process of Haidilao &quot;continuously evolving&quot; in order to &quot;maintain the character&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the iteration of Haidilao&#39;s special services, from &quot;first-generation special services&quot; such as manicures, playing cards, free snacks, origami meal replacement fees, to clerks singing happy birthday and giving dolls to accompany solo diners This kind of &quot;advanced service&quot;, and later &quot;helping with children&quot;, &quot;helping with PPT correction&quot; and even &quot;open overnight stay&quot; can be said to be &quot;more and more complicated&quot; and &quot;more and more hardworking&quot;, triggering a craze and diversity of topics. The response has also been through the roof. Haidilao’s hot topics this year include not only “waiters dancing”, but also special services such as “concert bus pick-up” and “free hair washing for customers”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the hot search titles of &quot;The number of people queuing up to watch Haidilao dancing has climbed to 500&quot; and &quot;The waiter gets a 3,000 yuan reward for dancing&quot; also show that Haidilao&#39;s special services are themselves a kind of topic marketing. Or event marketing. Haidilao&#39;s new special services are always in the news and hotly searched again and again. This not only brings traffic and free advertising to itself, but also solidifies the character of Haidilao&#39;s &quot;special services&quot; and promotes Haidilao&#39;s popularity here. Continue to &quot;evolve&quot; on this road, encourage waiters to make more attempts, and meet customers&#39; picky and even bizarre differentiated needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Haidilao’s road to unique character design and event marketing has not been smooth, and there will always be some controversy. News such as &quot;The waiter refused to celebrate the customer&#39;s doll&#39;s birthday&quot; and &quot;Haidilao overnight tourist special forces affected customers&#39; dining&quot; often appeared, which shows the contradictions and inconsistencies: many customers enjoyed it and enjoyed it, while some customers could not bear it. It disturbs, complains and complains. There are also voices in the public opinion field that believe that Haidilao should &quot;return to the standard of catering services&quot; and appropriately restrain &quot;over-service&quot; and &quot;over-entertainment&quot; to avoid &quot;damage to the brand image.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what everyone knows is that Haidilao has achieved two-way screening with consumer groups through its constantly iterative special services. A recent hot search for &quot;Women spent nearly 270,000 on Haidilao in 9 years&quot; shows that Haidilao is more willing to screen out &quot;loyal users&quot; than those customers who &quot;complain&quot; or even &quot;call the police&quot; and use rounds of special services. Use event marketing to strengthen the loyalty of these customers and serve this basic base well. Haidilao creates its own personality that is different from other catering brands in order to further create more topical effects and achieve event marketing effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a merchant, Haidilao enjoys the right to operate independently and has the right to decide &quot;how to provide goods and services.&quot; It also has the right to adjust the rules and scope of services and integrate &quot;waiter dancing&quot; into its &quot;real-time processing, production, and commercial sales.&quot; and service labor” business scope. As long as the waiters dancing does not violate laws and regulations, Haidilao&#39;s encouragement of waiters to dance may result in filtering out those customers who are disgusted with dancing, and more customers will come who like to watch dancing. As for whether it is worthwhile to select customers in this way and whether the brand image is damaged, the decision-making power is still in the hands of Haidilao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many netizens suggested that Haidilao might be divided into a &quot;singing and dancing area&quot; and a &quot;quiet dining area.&quot; This proposal represents the voice of a considerable number of customers who “just want to dine quietly”. They may still like Haidilao’s catering and other special services, but they are just not interested in singing and dancing. How Haidilao takes care of the needs of this group of customers, and whether these customers will reluctantly give up and avoid dining out, everything should be left to Haidilao to decide. Whether it is special characters or event marketing, they have not deviated from the right to operate independently. However, customers who are really not interested in &quot;Subject Three&quot; or even find it noisy and annoying may stay away from Haidilao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打不过就加入，年轻人成了抢秋裤的主力军]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261004]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[威慑“致使他人感染艾滋病”的违法犯罪行为，是阻断传播的有力之举丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261848]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-04 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the &quot;Beijing News&quot; report, on November 26, the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention released the city&#39;s latest AIDS epidemic situation. According to reports, from January to October 2023, there were 1,404 new cases of infected people and patients currently living in Beijing, a decrease of 3.97% compared with the same period last year; 95.51% of the new cases were sexually transmitted, of which 71.94% were transmitted through male homosexual behavior, Heterosexual transmission is 23.58%; other transmission routes are 4.49%. Currently, there are 27,285 living infected and sick people in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This statistic deserves in-depth analysis. It can be seen that the current mode of transmission of AIDS in Beijing is still mainly sexual transmission, accounting for an absolute majority of 95%. This follows the trend that has been going on for many years, that is, among the three traditional transmission routes of AIDS: sex, blood, and mother-to-child transmission, the route by which ordinary people are most likely to be infected is still sexual transmission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The publicity and education to prevent the spread of AIDS at home and abroad are indispensable in content that calls for good hygiene and safety measures, such as the &quot;ABC principle&quot; of &quot;controlling sexual desire, being loyal to your partner, and using condoms.&quot; However, the traditional values ​​that advocate &quot;temperance&quot; and &quot;loyalty&quot; lack coercive force and lack of deterrence. Promoting the use of condoms and popularizing HPV vaccination are only technical means that treat the symptoms rather than the root cause. Once the parties embrace the value of &quot;sexual freedom&quot;, can they still take safety measures? In other words, at least fulfill the obligation to inform sexual partners and quickly stop the spread of the virus? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to further prevent the spread of AIDS requires more than just &quot;publicity and education&quot; in the traditional sense, but more efforts should be made in legislation and law enforcement to adapt to the new trends in the current spread of AIDS. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 38 of the &quot;Regulations on the Prevention and Treatment of AIDS&quot; stipulates that people infected with HIV and patients have the obligation to &quot;timely inform those who have sexual relations with them of the fact of infection or onset of disease&quot;; Article 62 stipulates that people infected with HIV Or if an AIDS patient intentionally spreads AIDS, he shall bear civil liability for compensation in accordance with the law; if it constitutes a crime, he shall be investigated for criminal liability in accordance with the law; Article 77 of the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases&quot; also stipulates: Units and individuals violate legal provisions, resulting in the spread of infectious diseases, Anyone who causes damage to others&#39; personal or property due to the epidemic shall bear civil liability in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is still some distance between &quot;failure to fulfill the obligation to inform&quot; and the spread of AIDS and whether one should bear criminal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 12 of the 2017 &quot;Interpretation of Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in Criminal Cases of Organizing, Coercing, Seducing, Accommodating, and Introduction of Prostitution&quot; stipulated that &quot;Knowing that one is infected with HIV and deliberately failing to take precautions&quot; The situation of &quot;having sexual relations with others while taking measures&quot; can be regarded as &quot;serious injury&quot; under Article 95 of the Criminal Law, and can be convicted according to the &quot;crime of intentional injury&quot; in Article 234 of the Criminal Law, but this is limited to situations where prostitution occurs. If you have sex with others but do not cause other people to be infected, you will only need to bear civil liability at most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The privacy rights of AIDS patients cannot and should not be higher than the health rights of their partners and spouses. The Marriage and Family Section of the Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China has used legislation to affirm the parties&#39; obligation to &quot;disclose major illnesses before marriage,&quot; which of course includes AIDS, which is of great concern. If the HIV carrier or patient fails to fulfill his obligation to inform, the injured spouse may request an annulment of the marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 12, 2023, the Supreme People’s Court announced a number of typical Civil Code cases, including the “Lin v. Zhang Annulment of Marriage Case”: Lin and Zhang registered their marriage through a blind date. After marriage, Zhang confessed to Lin that he had suffered from AIDS for many years. Lin sued the court to invalidate or annul the marriage, and the court ruled to annul the marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the problem is that it is easy to cancel the civil relationship of marriage. Who should bear the responsibility for HIV infection? And in those cases where people “intentionally have sexual relations with others and maliciously spread AIDS”, should the law still protect their privacy and sexual rights? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The judicial community is also making some attempts to this end. Article 20 of the &quot;Yunnan Provincial AIDS Prevention and Treatment Regulations&quot; that will be implemented on March 1, 2021 stipulates that &quot;infected persons and patients should promptly inform their spouses or sexual partners of the fact of being infected with HIV; if they do not do so, the medical and health institutions shall The right to be notified.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This legislation is a breakthrough, showing that citizens&#39; health rights are prioritized over the privacy rights of AIDS patients. However, it still does not resolve the issues of &quot;how to inform&quot; and &quot;whether medical and health institutions are obliged to inform&quot;, nor does it break through the privacy provisions of the &quot;Regulations on the Prevention and Treatment of AIDS&quot;. Technically speaking, &quot;non-marital and non-regular sexual partners&quot; are not uncommon nowadays. How can medical and health institutions notify them one by one? How to further increase the deterrent effect against such behavior is worthy of further study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the judicial interpretations of the two high authorities define the act of &quot;causing others to be infected with AIDS&quot; as &quot;serious injury,&quot; there is no reason why the law should not severely punish such cases of knowingly and intentionally transmitting AIDS to sexual partners outside of prostitution and whoring. behavior, otherwise the fairness of the law will be greatly compromised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the judiciary can make it clear that if the person concerned knows that he or she is carrying HIV and has sex with anyone else without informing him/her, it is an act of malicious endangerment to others, and will be considered as intentional harm causing serious injury. According to Article 234 of the Criminal Law, the penalty standard is fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years. If the attempt fails, that is, if it does not cause infection, the punishment will be lighter or reduced. Only in this way can the dignity of the law be reflected and the criminals who attempt to commit rape can be better deterred. A lucky thief in the department, protecting potential victims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, further prevention and treatment of AIDS cannot be limited to publicizing and educating those &quot;ABCD&quot; principles, or hoping to use technical means to find and fill gaps, let the law grow teeth, and deter illegal crimes that &quot;cause others to be infected with AIDS&quot; Behavior is a more powerful way to block the transmission route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[低调收官，女性群像剧不香了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261801]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-04 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;According to Max Research Institute The 2023 edition of the Employment Blue Book shows that the proportion of graduates returning to their hometowns for employment has been on an upward trend in the past five years, rising from 43% to 47%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This reflects the new choices of young people: It is said that &quot;the hometown cannot accommodate the body, and the foreign country cannot accommodate the soul.&quot; Faced with the hometown and the foreign country, where should we go? &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A big city with better resources symbolizes ambition and ambition; a small but beautiful hometown that gives birth to and raises me exudes The alluring &quot;nostalgia&quot; points to a more comfortable life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/64dd4544e074f7f7a9a76e1be417de74.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;606&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/64dd4544e074f7f7a9a76e1be417de74.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260590 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Based on this division, film and television creation has formed two competing trends: one focuses on young people’s wandering in foreign lands and explores their bitterness, struggle and embarrassment; the other focuses on young people The wave of returning home is to explore their emotions and motivations for returning home, and to start anew in their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, there are two &quot;sister chapters&quot; of the female group drama &quot;I&#39;m fine in a foreign country&quot; (2021) and &quot;Hometown, Goodbye&quot; (2023).

For example, the transformation of girls&#39; styles after returning to their hometowns is very consistent with the setting of &quot;returning home&quot;; furthermore, the relationship between parents and children will also lose a sense of boundary as the physical distance shortens, which will lead to various contradiction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/bf5626bbf1ffc5356ee7b62a1727e581.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;433&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/bf5626bbf1ffc5356ee7b62a1727e581.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;260598 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It’s just that for similar issues,&lt;/span>; everyone feels fresh after watching it once, but will get tired of it the second time. With &quot;I&#39;m Good in a Foreign Country&quot; at the forefront, the audience naturally hopes for &quot;Hometown, You&#39;ll Be Safe&quot; to take it to the next level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same is true when it extends to female group portrait dramas. As more and more female group dramas appear together, homogeneous characters and copy-pasted plots have quickly made such dramas fall into a &quot;narrowing&quot; situation. Even the protagonists in the play can be arranged and combined to summarize similar personality patterns: glamorous girls, cold girls, androgynous girls, ordinary girls, rich second generation, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And those female group portrait dramas that really break out of the industry often have their own killer features. &quot;Only Thirty&quot; presents the life anxieties of middle-class women; &quot;Ten &lt;span>;1 and 2&quot; takes care of the entire process of 20+ women from school to society; &quot;Love Is Delicious&quot; smoothly integrates the background of the epidemic, Lightly and playfully capturing the reconciliation between women, their families and themselves, &quot;I&#39;m Good in a Foreign Country&quot; takes a different approach and captures the joys and hardships of urban workers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/025e8d6913e540c6cca926db1431df1e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/025e8d6913e540c6cca926db1431df1e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260597 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Compared with &quot;I&#39;m fine in a foreign country&quot;, &quot;Hometown,&lt;/span>;Goodbye&quot; is more than warm, but not cold enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life tells us that not all difficulties will dissipate in love. There are bound to be some hurdles that cannot be overcome. These obstacles may be Gu Jia and Wang Manni&#39;s &quot;class sorrow&quot;, Jiang Xiaoguo&#39;s &quot;education pain&quot;, Xia Meng&#39;s &quot;love confusion&quot;, or Hu Jingjing&#39;s workplace PUA. They&#39;re there, there&#39;s no way to escape or hide. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Hometown, Stay Safe&quot; cleverly swallows all these problems, but the reality tells us time and time again that this is not the case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/78803f88c90f2086feec4be2add2d8a6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/78803f88c90f2086feec4be2add2d8a6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260599 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The understanding of female group portraits in domestic dramas still remains at the level of gender discrimination in the workplace, preference for boys over girls, conflicts between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and encounters with scumbag men. These repeatedly mentioned and discussed topics are just the tip of the iceberg compared to the real and subtle plight of women. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course, we do not require all female group dramas to be heavy and sharp, and those heavy topics may not necessarily make a good drama. Just looking at the current market saturation, after experiencing the precipitation of &quot;trends&quot; and &quot;routines&quot;, those good dramas that have been unearthed must have their own uniqueness - either a unique perspective, a unique style, or a novel setting. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/2009e19e526280633e3d017753995616.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;404&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/04/2009e19e526280633e3d017753995616.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260600 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Affected by social trends, in the next few years, the content dividends of female group dramas&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (at least female themes)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; may still be will last. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Combining this demand with past successful experiences, it does not seem difficult for creators to mass-produce some 50-60% works. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;But this kind of template with no new ideas will eventually make people bored after seeing it too much. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;I hope that in the future, domestic female group dramas will be more caring and less consuming for women. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;After all, the most correct way to open up female themes is to not deliberately amplify contradictions and conflicts, to put women&#39;s plight and pressure on the table, and to reasonably and truly present the colorful and diverse &quot;her era&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 21:25:57 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[网络微短剧，狂飙与刹车]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261678]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-04 21:12:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;A domineering president falls in love with an intern, a young girl travels through ancient times to become a princess, and the delivery boy is actually the second generation of a wealthy family... These local micro-short dramas have suddenly emerged on domestic social media, and have also traveled across the ocean to become the favorites of foreigners. The micro-short dramas are densely packed with excitement, sweetness, and ups and downs, making people unable to stop watching and willing to &quot;spend money.&quot; Data shows that the number of micro-short dramas registered in my country in 2022 will be close to 2,800, an increase of 600% from 2021. The myth of &quot;the tycoon goes to the sea and makes millions a day&quot; has also begun to spread. Along with the surging momentum, there are also many chaos: shoddy production, malicious diversion, and incorrect views. When special rectification presses the pause button for messy micro-short dramas, what will be left in this industry in the end?</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 21:25:57 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[全国人大代表萧志伟：澳门可以发挥“精准联系人”的角色]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261850]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-04 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[辽宁大连旅顺口老铁山水域一钓鱼艇涉险 已致4人遇难]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261866]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-04 18:48:06&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At about 23:00 on December 3, the Dalian Maritime Search and Rescue Center received an alarm.
