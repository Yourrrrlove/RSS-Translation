Since the Honor of Kings World Champions Cup was held in 2019, no team outside China has won the championship. Experienced reporters come to the scene not to watch the game, but to see the status of the players. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of a reporter from an e-sports magazine, among the seven e-sports events in the Asian Games, &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; is not very competitive, but it has the largest number of domestic players among the seven events. The most well-known game was the first to reach the finals in the schedule, so this game has a deeper historical significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games, the Chinese team won the championship in the &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; event, but it was an exhibition match. Today&#39;s gold medal is legal.&quot; Two-time Asian Games winner The gap is reflected in his experience. In 2018, he could not go through the media channel, but this year he can. &quot;It&#39;s just a different channel, but the feeling in his heart is different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/mtxJzBlptUba9tQDzUY2CxCjyQJtOJtAGhyJVYRV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/mtxJzBlptUba9tQDzUY2CxCjyQJtOJtAGhyJVYRV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252463&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023 On September 26, 2020, in the final of the Asian Games version of the e-sports e-sports King of Glory in Hangzhou, Chinese team player Luo Siyuan (middle) competed in the game &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/Hta0j2IyEs9mbBDeSefhhvw88OzzOuJ2YaogipQK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;681&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/Hta0j2IyEs9mbBDeSefhhvw88OzzOuJ2YaogipQK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252464&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 26, 2023, in the Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports King of Glory Asian Games version finals, the Chinese team defeated the Malaysian team 2-0 and won the championship&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;1pm&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;7&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong >;00&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Inside the venue, the rehearsal for the finals has begun. Outside the venue, the official licensed merchandise retail store of the Hangzhou E-Sports Center is taking final orders before the audience enters. In addition to mascot items like other projects, souvenirs surrounding e-sports projects also include categories co-branded with game IPs, which “sell out very quickly.” When faced with the question of why there are so few e-sports souvenirs in e-sports venues, the young The counterman replied, &quot;Mascot badges are basically hard to buy. There are hundreds of them a day and they are sold out in the morning. The popular character badges were sold out two days ago.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to prepare for the finals, the warehouse I urgently restocked the goods the night before and replenished a batch of souvenirs through all the channels I could find, including the Gongsunli badges of &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; that had already been sold out, but I couldn&#39;t wait for the final audience to enter. &quot;Before the third place match in the afternoon. It’s all sold out.” Brother Cabinet’s tone was filled with regret, “We are not fully mentally prepared.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are not many e-sports peripherals left for the final audience, “The badges are sold out, the magnetic books The irons are sold out, the keychains are sold out, the card sets of Li Bai and Shangguan Wan&#39;er are sold out, and Gongsunli&#39;s are sold out. This character is very popular, and there are only two of her bookmarks left.&quot; The cabinet brother thinks they belong to the contestants. Hobbies drive consumption. He heard from the audience that the character commonly used by contestant Xu Bicheng (ID: Yinuo) is Gongsun Li. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Brother Cabinet’s job is to sell goods, he was also puzzled by the purchasing power of the audience. He opened the stationery gift box on the shelf nearby, “The gift box contains 4 items, notebook, pen, Exclusive bookmarks and sticky notes are priced at 208 yuan. I thought no one would buy them at first, but they have almost sold out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/09/27/cD1FMIJlvjfDI1M24YTRNBk6a04y1YojTNWhkdRM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;724&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /09/27/cD1FMIJlvjfDI1M24YTRNBk6a04y1YojTNWhkdRM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252465&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 26, 2023, Hangzhou Asian Games Electronics The final of the Asian Games version of Honor of Kings, players from the Chinese team (right) and the Malaysian team in the game &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong >;PM 1&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;7&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;30&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The audience is about to enter. Without enough time to wait for the store manager&#39;s reply, another counter girl in the franchise store went to the warehouse and moved the remaining seal keychains, which belonged to the characters Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao. As soon as they were put on the shelves, a male spectator took away all the three Daqiao keychains. Seeing this, the counter girl stuffed the Xiaoqiao keychains she wanted to put on the shelf back into the box, &quot;Hide some first, otherwise there will be no more.&quot; Things are sold.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More spectators crowded into the hall at the entrance. Seven cosplay game character actors were invited to stand in the center of the hall for a group photo. People waiting for the group photo volunteered at the venue. There was a long queue behind the audience, and almost every audience member who came through the door stopped to identify the characters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gathered crowd made it easy for media reporters to find the people they wanted to interview. A media from Hubei wanted to interview fans of the Wuhan eStarPro team. Two players from this team were selected for the national team, namely Luo Siyuan (ID: Huahai) and Sun Linwei (ID: Tanran). Young girl Yang Yiqing was chosen as the interviewee from the crowd. She was easily identifiable as she was wearing the uniform of the eStarPro team and carrying a bag of support materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the camera, Yang Yiqing enthusiastically praised the positive value of the players, &quot;I want to say something about Luo Siyuan. He has taken on the responsibility of captain and has always been very responsible, very determined, and very diligent in training.&quot; , led the team members to help the team win so many championships, I think they represent the spirit of perseverance and hard work.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eStarPro team has won 8 championships in previous competitive competitions. Regarding tonight&#39;s championship, the mentality of fans is much better than that of the media. Yang Yiqing said: &quot;Player Sun Linwei has just celebrated his 20th birthday. I am also here to wish him the first gold medal at the age of 20.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The support materials brought by Yang Yiqing include banners and small flags, which are spontaneously produced by the players or their team&#39;s fan clubs. A few days before the finals, each support club chose to distribute the materials at the Intime Department Store at the intersection away from the e-sports center. The materials with the personal photos of the players were to express their stance, and all the players of the national team were printed to show the pattern. The biggest one is Xu Bicheng’s (ID: Yinuo) Zebra Paradise Support Club. They set up a display area directly in the atrium on the first floor of the shopping mall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the game started, each company’s support materials competed in a round. When the venue’s cameras scanned the auditorium, the fans held up their banners high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/sBFZOTT3mdSIpJs8yAHJQQbm0uApeUfFLuBic1qZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/sBFZOTT3mdSIpJs8yAHJQQbm0uApeUfFLuBic1qZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;E-sports souvenir shelves in Hangzhou E-sports Center&#39;s licensed merchandise retail store&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Yangxin/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;In the evening 1&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;8&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;30&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The auditorium is filling up one after another , the warm-up music before the game was played loudly on the field, and the DJ chose a RAP version of &quot;Good Luck&quot;. In fact, the spectators who can come to the game are very lucky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tickets for the Asian Games e-sports events will go on sale on August 14, 2023. It is the only event where ticket purchase qualifications are determined by drawing lots, and it is also the most expensive event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no statistical data on the winning rate of single-game tickets, but according to the official blog of the Hangzhou Asian Organizing Committee, there are at least 5 million users who apply to purchase tickets for e-sports events, and the maximum number of spectators for each game is no more than 4,000 people. Among them, &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot; and &quot;Dota2&quot; are particularly popular. On September 23, the official ticket purchase system released some tickets again, and the tickets for these three projects were almost sold out in seconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/dcoHGEW6YFq4faY2Qrf8rKvKsntTDWLjJTae8Xbu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/dcoHGEW6YFq4faY2Qrf8rKvKsntTDWLjJTae8Xbu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252467&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hangzhou E-sports Center licensed merchandise retail store, spectators waiting for the replenishment of e-sports souvenirs&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Yangxin/Picture)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Night&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;19&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;47&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Live broadcast , the just-concluded 19th Asian Games Hangzhou Honor of Kings Asian Games version finals, the Chinese team defeated the Malaysian team and won the Honor of Kings Asian Games version championship, winning the first gold medal in e-sports. It was also the Chinese sports team’s first victory in this Asian Games. The 48th gold medal won. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final between the Chinese team and the Malaysian team lasted two rounds, and each round was won with an absolute advantage, taking about 15 minutes each. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the award ceremony, the faces of several Chinese contestants appeared on the big screen one by one, with tears faintly flashing. When the emcee picked up the medal and hung it up for Lin Heng (ID: Nuanyang), Chi Xiaoming (ID: Ming) next to him lowered his head in misunderstanding, then stood up quickly, revealing a trace of his nervousness. Xu Bicheng also showed nervousness. Facing the cheers of the audience, he raised his right hand and scratched his head unconsciously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After exiting, the six contestants passed through the mixed interview area. The long passage was filled with reporters and volunteers. A small blackboard was erected at the media entrance, &quot;The mixed interview area is full.&quot; Several young people who had just won the award dispersed and expressed their excitement at the moment to the microphones and cameras swarming in front of them. Jiang Tao (ID: Adou) finished his speech and was about to leave when he was stopped by a bunch of voices. Dozens of reporters immediately surrounded the place where he stopped. Only the one with the loudest voice could get the right to ask questions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last question was grabbed by a female reporter: &quot;What do you want to say to our audience?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I did it, and I believe you can do it too.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After saying this, Adou walked towards the exit accompanied by the team manager. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[减持“新规”从严落实！沪深交易所进一步明确破发、破净、分红不达标条件]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257772]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 19:37:58&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;After the China Securities Regulatory Commission launched the &quot;new regulations&quot; on shareholding reduction, the market is in urgent need of detailed rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 26, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges issued relevant notices, clarifying some of the constraints in the new regulations on shareholding reduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission’s requirements for share reductions on August 27 show that controlling shareholders and actual controllers of companies whose shares are broken, broken, or whose dividends do not meet the target are not allowed to reduce their shareholdings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the requirements were issued, many listed companies announced the early termination of their shareholding reduction plans. Taking the Shanghai Stock Exchange as an example, the controlling shareholders, actual controllers, directors, supervisors, and senior executives of 35 companies terminated their shareholding reduction plans in advance, and the &quot;key minority&quot; personnel of 18 companies voluntarily promised not to reduce their shareholdings in the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the market has also raised through various channels a series of implementation standards issues such as how to judge relevant conditions and what methods to limit shareholding reduction. To this end, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges have conducted systematic and in-depth research to refine relevant implementation standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice issued by the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges clarified the standards for breaking the issue, breaking the net or failing to pay dividends, clarifying the scope of the secondary market holding reduction, clarifying whether the conditions are met during pre-disclosure, etc., responded to market concerns. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;You can reduce your holdings only if you cannot break the stock price or break the net price for 20 consecutive days&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As we all know, a stock price break means the stock price is lower than the issue price when it was first issued. To avoid artificial manipulation, a break here means that the closing price of the stock on any of the 20 trading days before the announcement of the shareholding reduction plan is lower than the stock issuance price at the time of the initial public offering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges require that the stock price does not break for 20 consecutive trading days before they can reduce their holdings. This article is applicable to the controlling shareholders, actual controllers and persons acting in concert at the time of the initial public offering of the listed company; if the issuer discloses that it has no controlling shareholder or actual controller, it applies to the largest shareholder at the time of the initial public offering. and its actual controllers and persons acting in concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Net-breaking means that the stock price is lower than the net assets per share. The notice shows that the so-called net loss here refers to the closing price of the stock on any of the 20 trading days before the announcement of the shareholding reduction plan is lower than the net assets per share at the end of the most recent fiscal year or the most recent financial accounting report period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Senior market insiders pointed out, “In order to improve the accuracy and timeliness of judgment, two comparison benchmarks are set (for the net breaking situation), namely the latest financial report and the audited annual report for the most recent year. , the holdings can be reduced only if the net is not broken. Same as the break, twenty trading days are also selected, and the holding can be reduced only if the net is not broken.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in order to ensure the comparability of prices, the net is broken and the net is broken. All adopt the backward re-weighting calculation method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market participant said, &quot;This notice strictly identifies the circumstances in which holdings cannot be reduced. For example, for breaking the stock and breaking the net, it is not simply that the stock is not broken or the net is not broken on a certain day as the conditions for reduction, but It is required to not break the stock price or net profit for 20 consecutive trading days. This can prevent controlling shareholders and actual controllers from manipulating the stock price to cooperate with the reduction of holdings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Excluding fiscal years with negative net profits&lt;/p>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Dividends that do not meet the standard include two types of situations: one is that there is no dividend for three years; the other is that the accumulated amount of dividends over the three years does not reach 30% of the three-year average annual net profit. The year of judgment is the fiscal year for which the audited annual report is disclosed. It is worth noting that fiscal years in which net profits are negative are not included. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some special circumstances in the calculation of whether dividends meet the standards. For example, if there are losses for three consecutive years but profits are distributed because the accumulated undistributed profits are positive, if according to the natural algorithm, the average annual net profit for three years is negative, a small amount of dividends can meet the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For another example, one or two years in the past three years have been profitable, and the remaining years have suffered losses and the losses have been huge, resulting in a negative average annual net profit in the past three years. According to natural calculations, a small amount of dividends may be appropriate. Achievable standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid such a situation, this time it is stipulated that the loss-making years will be excluded from the calculation standard, and only the dividend amount and average annual net profit of the profitable years will be calculated. According to this standard, if there are losses in the last three years, there are no years that can be calculated, and the standard cannot be met, and the shareholding cannot be reduced; if the cumulative net profit in the last three years is negative, the loss-making years will be eliminated, and the dividends for the remaining profitable years will reach 30%. Only then can we reduce our holdings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of industry insiders, in fact, the elimination calculation method and standards are more stringent, basically achieving the effect that controlling shareholders and actual controllers of loss-making companies are not allowed to reduce their holdings. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Block transactions are included in the scope of secondary market holding reductions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges pointed out that according to general understanding, the secondary market refers to centralized bidding transactions and block transactions. If other methods of reduction are achieved through the above two methods or are similar to them, they should also be implemented with reference to the same standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This notice also adds pre-disclosure requirements for large transactions. The current holding reduction rules do not force major shareholders to disclose in advance before reducing their holdings in large-scale transactions. In order to prevent controlling shareholders and actual controllers from reducing their holdings through large-scale transactions without meeting the conditions, new rules for large-scale transactions have been added this time. The pre-disclosure obligation requires them to pre-disclose 15 trading days in advance with reference to the regulations on centralized bidding, and to make disclosures during and after the event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Analysts believe that &quot;this move further improves the transparency of shareholding reduction and facilitates small and medium-sized investors to understand the holding reduction arrangements of controlling shareholders and actual controllers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of disclosure requirements , when the shareholding reduction plan is disclosed in advance during the start-up stage of the shareholding reduction, the controlling shareholder and actual controller should determine whether the conditions that prohibit the shareholding reduction are met. If it is met, it cannot be disclosed; if the conditions for shareholding reduction are met, the shareholding reduction plan can be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Strengthen supervision of violations&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What will be done if relevant entities violate relevant regulations? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is reported that exchanges can take self-regulatory measures according to their rules, including self-regulatory measures, disciplinary sanctions, trading restrictions, etc. The China Securities Regulatory Commission may impose administrative penalties or take regulatory measures in accordance with the Securities Law and the Certain Provisions on the Reduction of Shareholdings by Shareholders, Directors, Supervisors and Senior Management of Listed Companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from past cases, the exchange has taken disciplinary actions and restricted trading measures for serious violations. The China Securities Regulatory Commission also imposed severe fines and heavy penalties. For example, Shanghai Yingyi violated pre-disclosure requirements and reduced its holdings of WuXi AppTec shares and was fined 200 million yuan; Yu Fanyi and others violated regulations by reducing their holdings of Wole Home shares, and their illegal gains were confiscated and severely punished. A fine of more than 30 million yuan was imposed; the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued a notice of criticism and disciplinary sanctions to the shareholders of Xtest Testing on the day they announced the illegal reduction of holdings. The company&#39;s shareholders promised to repurchase the excess reduction of shares and hand over the illegal gains. The relevant measures have been completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in recent cases, parties that have illegally reduced their holdings have repurchased the shares that have been illegally reduced. It is expected that stock repurchases will also become one of the important measures to punish violators and will never be allowed. The offender benefits from the violation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, the Shanghai Stock Exchange will further strengthen the supervision of shareholding reduction behaviors: First, it will improve the transparency of information disclosure of shareholding reductions. For pre-disclosure announcements of shareholding reductions, it is required to fully explain whether the conditions for shareholding reductions are met. The second is to strengthen the monitoring of holding reduction behaviors, strengthen transaction supervision, and promptly discover illegal holding reduction behaviors. The third is to do a good job in rule consultation and policy interpretation, and guide listed companies to ensure the first compliance level in the disclosure of information on shareholder reductions; the fourth is to take regulatory measures in a timely manner, and in the case of suspected violations, send letters to inquire, Telephone reminders and other measures will be taken to verify that violations are involved, and disciplinary sanctions will be implemented quickly and strictly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shenzhen Stock Exchange stated that it will also further strengthen supervision work: First, improve the supervision of information disclosure of shareholding reductions. For pre-disclosure announcements of shareholding reductions, it is required to fully explain whether the conditions for shareholding reductions are met. The second is to improve the functions of the shareholding reduction monitoring system, strengthen transaction supervision, and detect violations in a timely manner. The third is to take regulatory measures in a timely manner. For suspected violations, measures such as sending letters to inquire and calling reminders will be adopted as soon as possible to verify that violations are involved, and disciplinary sanctions will be implemented quickly and strictly. maintain behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 19:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中共中央政治局召开会议 审议《关于二十届中央第一轮巡视情况的综合报告》 中共中央总书记习近平主持会议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257776]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 19:46:38&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting on September 27 to review the &quot;About the First Round of Inspections of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China&quot; Comprehensive Report.

According to &quot;Shangguan News&quot;, the three-year-old son of Mr. Wang from Changshu was diagnosed with autism two years ago and has been seeking medical treatment to no avail. In the first half of this year, Mr. Wang came into contact with an organization that claimed to be able to cure autism, and joined a WeChat group with nearly 500 people. There is a &quot;warm atmosphere&quot; in the group, and group members often share successful treatment cases. Over time, Mr. Wang couldn&#39;t help but be moved, so he signed a &quot;Modern Traditional Chinese Medicine Technology Meridian Conditioning Service Agreement&quot; with this organization called &quot;Qiawei&quot; and gritted his teeth and paid 503,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, after eight times of &quot;conditioning&quot; from this institution, the child still showed no improvement. He reported this situation in the WeChat group, but was directly kicked out of the group chat. Mr. Wang&#39;s experience is not an isolated case. Another child who purchased &quot;conditioning&quot; services also did not improve. According to media reports, what this institution has done has been suspected of fraud, and its fraud methods have also been packaged in multiple layers. Upon closer inspection, it can be described as a nested &quot;pig-killing plate&quot;, but it is wrapped in seemingly ordinary medical services. In the service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, this organization invented a wonderful and mysterious story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;therapy&quot; called &quot;Meridian Reconstruction&quot; itself is very similar to the Taoist art of &quot;opening up the two meridians of Ren and Du&quot;, and this organization has added another layer of packaging to it: &quot;using clustered pressure wave technology&quot; &quot;Modern technology&quot; filter creates the so-called &quot;integration of diagnostic indicators of Western medicine and syndrome differentiation methods of traditional Chinese medicine&quot;. It looks amazing, but also has some black humor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the treatment details of the &quot;conditioning service&quot;, the staff member held the child&#39;s arm with one hand and held a pistol-like instrument terminal in the other hand, moving it back and forth on the child&#39;s arm. As can be seen in the video, Mr. Wang&#39;s child was quite frightened and impatient during the treatment process. The true efficacy of this &quot;conditioning service&quot; is probably self-evident. The image of the staff holding &quot;pistols&quot; is very reminiscent of the Yuzhang Academy-style &quot;electric shock therapy&quot;. So, how is it different from &quot;science pretends to be magical and technology makes ghosts&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this organization has also played a long-standing quasi-MLM scam, which even includes the method of &quot;killing pigs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Qiawei Health&quot; carefully sets up the rhetoric of &quot;public welfare treatment&quot; and &quot;commercial treatment&quot;, which not only creates an image of &quot;public welfare and charity&quot; on the surface, but also artificially creates &quot;scarcity&quot; anxiety, step by step Inducing Mr. Wang to spend money: Spend money to buy &quot;commercial treatment&quot; so that you don&#39;t have to wait for &quot;public welfare treatment&quot;. At the same time, they also lost no time in letting the &quot;medical care&quot; appear in the group chat and talk about the &quot;miraculous curative effect&quot;, which is very similar to the classic &quot;medical care&quot; scam performed in the movie &quot;I am not the God of Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Wang, who was eager to treat patients, finally fell under the psychological offensive of &quot;enthusiastic patients&quot;. There were five other families who signed the agreement with Mr. Wang in this scam. The WeChat group chat where you could see various successful cases every day was forcibly disbanded shortly after the payment was made. This method, which is exactly the same as telecommunications fraud, can be called an alternative &quot;pig-killing plate&quot;, but the target has changed from &quot;investment/marriage&quot; to medical services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 266 of the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that whoever defrauds public or private property, if the amount is particularly huge or there are other particularly serious circumstances, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years or life imprisonment, and shall also be fined or have property confiscated. Mr. Wang paid exactly 503,000 yuan in &quot;treatment fees,&quot; which exceeded 500,000 yuan, meeting the standard of &quot;extremely large amounts&quot; in the &quot;Interpretation of Several Issues Concerning the Specific Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Fraud&quot; of the two top governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the suspected criminal behavior of this institution may go beyond what happened to Mr. Wang and others in this report, and it deserves further investigation by the police and medical supervision departments: This is a qualified and legal medical institution. ? Is the treatment performed a legal medical treatment that has been proven to be safe and effective? Are the people performing the treatment qualified to practice medicine? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If, as reported by the media, the staff did say &quot;approved by the state,&quot; then this is a blatant use of public power to endorse themselves, and may also be suspected of forging, altering, and buying and selling official documents of state agencies. Certificates and seals; at the same time, the main business of &quot;Qiawei Health&quot; registered with the Industrial and Commercial Bureau is &quot;health consultation&quot; and &quot;health care&quot;, and may not be qualified to practice medical treatment. In this way, it is suspected of illegal medical practice; the expensive &quot;treatment&quot; &quot;The cost&quot; far exceeds the reasonable price range for &quot;consultation&quot; and &quot;health care&quot;. This is another out-and-out price fraud and is suspected of being illegal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the medical community still has not yet reached a completely clear consensus on the pathology, symptoms and treatment options of autism. The range of autism symptoms is also very wide, and different patients may need completely different treatment plans. There is no such a one-size-fits-all so-called &quot;meridian reconstruction&quot; therapy, and it is difficult for formal treatment to achieve a once-and-for-all effect. &quot;Qiawei Health&quot; took advantage of the information asymmetry of the patients&#39; families to carefully design such a scam, and almost every aspect was suspected of illegal crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the &quot;service categories&quot; of this institution, the list of &quot;difficult and complicated diseases&quot; advertised by it also includes &quot;stroke, rheumatoid, ankylosing spondylitis, and ALS.&quot; &quot; and &quot;a total of 21 diseases&quot;, which seems a bit &quot;surprising&quot; to the outside world. As far as ALS is concerned, how can Qiawei Health be able to treat this rare disease that the world&#39;s top medical scientists are still trying to challenge? If it&#39;s true, I&#39;m afraid the world owes them a Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, &quot;Qiawei Health&quot; has been suspected of multiple illegal and criminal acts, including fraud. The public department should conduct an in-depth investigation into its illegal and criminal facts, seriously investigate its civil and criminal responsibilities, and compensate the victims. financial losses to the victims’ families and combat similar medical scams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[政府办马拉松，摊主开新店：淄博烧烤国庆“再拼一把”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257758]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 13, 2023, the 4th China International Cultural Tourism Expo was held in Jinan , Zibo barbecue model is on display in the exhibition area.

(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past &quot;May Day&quot; and the approaching &quot;National Day&quot;, Dr. Sun from the emergency department of Zibo Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital went on two missions during two consecutive long holidays. In order to protect people from all over the country who came to Zi for barbecue, as a member of the city&#39;s medical security team, he stayed on duty at the makeshift barbecue city for several days during the May Day holiday. The constant flow of people made him, an &quot;Old Zibo&quot;, feel unreal. The outside world kept saying that it was going to be cold, but it was always crowded every time he passed by the popular barbecue spot Ba Daji when he went out. Just like that, half a year passed in a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this summer vacation, the streets have indeed regained some calm, but after a marathon, the streets are noisy again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There will definitely be a wave of traffic during the National Day holiday. This is what it means to hold a marathon at this time.&quot; On September 24, the last weekend before the National Day holiday, this internet celebrity city held its first marathon Marathon. Just after the game ended that day, Dr. Sun gave his prediction for the passenger flow during the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because it was held in Zibo, this marathon was nicknamed the &quot;BBQ Marathon&quot; by runners. “As soon as I heard it was the Zibo Marathon, I rushed (to sign up).” After getting off the high-speed train at noon on September 23, Feng Yanhua made an appointment with fellow runners to have a meal. They queued for an hour and a half, and many people in front of the store were carrying Marathon on their backs. The pre-game package looked like a contestant who stopped by for the tooth festival. &quot;Zibo people are very welcoming, and the barbecue is very affordable and delicious.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After several months of &quot;turbulent&quot; drama, Zibo Barbecue has experienced a fierce evolution from explosion to crazy expansion, and then to a brief period of calm. Many interviewees said that after the summer vacation, the market showed obvious signs of calming down. However, whether it will return to its original shape before the epidemic or maintain an average value of warm but not cool, people are still waiting and watching, and it is difficult to tell. Conclusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the interviewees agreed that at least during this National Day Golden Week, Zibo will still see a peak of tourists. For this reason, businesses and citizens are eager to try to seize this possible &quot;last wave of traffic.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Barbecue shop owner: Give it a try again on National Day&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The obvious &quot;turning point&quot; occurred after the summer vacation. &quot;You can see it all at a glance&quot; on Badaju Street, which is booming. The popularity of Zibo barbecue has dropped after half a year. &quot;It was still very busy in July and August, but after September, it subsided a bit quickly.&quot; Standing at the fork in the traffic flow, whether to advance or retreat, the owner of a barbecue restaurant in Zhangdian District, Zibo City was a little undecided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boss Shan’s shop was featured in the documentary &quot;A String of Life&quot;, coupled with the super popularity of &quot;Going to Zi for Barbecue&quot;, the business has been really booming for a long time. &quot;It was a bit broken at the time. There were too many people, and the whole store was spinning.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that he had hired a lot more waiters, and his salary also increased from 2,800 to 3,000, and then from 3,000 to 3,500. &quot;Salaries must not be reduced, and personnel cannot be fired.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were too many stores, and the problem spread out. At that time, people all over the country went to Zibo, and no matter how many stores they had, they could digest it. Afterwards, the customer flow continued, but it was not as turbulent as before. Stores in poorer locations, or newer stores that were not well-known, did not even have many customers, so the wave of store openings slowed down. &quot;Newly opened stores have to hold activities, so they will have more customers, and old stores will be affected. New stores can&#39;t always hold activities, and if they don&#39;t hold events, they will have fewer customers.&quot; Boss Shan said that the Zibo barbecue industry has evolved from the previous &quot;dissuading customers&quot; to Now we need to compete on price and do fancy things to attract customers, &quot;it&#39;s starting to get rolled up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of Boss Shan’s “apprentices” resigned from his position as a bank lobby manager and joined the barbecue industry. He once doubted his choice, but persevered and caught up with the wave of traffic. He said that the barbecue industry is a low-investment, asset-light industry. After purchasing a store, it can open for business very quickly. Even so, without technology, it will still not be able to operate well. &quot;Making barbecue is very tiring, and you have to pay attention to quality.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It would also be a good thing to eliminate a number of hastily launched stores as the popularity drops. Boss Shan’s “apprentice” believes that the barbecue industry will get better and better, and he is actively stocking up to prepare for the National Day holiday. &quot;Keep your own quality and do long-term business. It&#39;s easy to open a store but difficult to maintain it. Now it&#39;s up to you to see who can endure it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I say that the heat is down, but I am very honest. Boss Shan is also planning A new store is planned to open during National Day. His judgment on the barbecue industry is that a number of stores will close down quickly and the customer flow will still remain at a high level. Therefore, taking advantage of the window period in September, he quickly decided to &quot;go against the market&quot; and expand. Coincidentally, the employees who were previously recruited do not need to be laid off and can be transferred to the new store on the spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course he is optimistic about the future market development, so he continues to bet on barbecue. More importantly, he has been doing barbecue for more than 20 years and can’t do anything else. &quot;I am in my forties. All my youth is invested in it.”最开始，单老板叫来母亲、姐姐，三个人一起干，从早忙到晚，也赚不到多少钱。坚持多年，2014年前后，生意才有所起色，慢慢摸索出这一行的门道来。 “起得比鸡早，睡得比狗晚，说到底，赚的还是辛苦钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我现在就是盼着&#39;十一&#39;到来，又开一家新店，打算&#39;十一&#39;拼一把。”他说&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“很坦诚，很热情，这里的人都很朴实。”封燕华说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者联系了淄博宣传部门和淄博市烧烤协会，试图了解这座网红城市备战国庆的相关事宜，但对方均婉拒了采访要求。不过，在外界看来，淄博已在有意逐渐推高热度，本次马拉松，在各个平台的推文中，“淄博烧烤”被当作赛事亮点进行着重介绍：“吃淄博烧烤，跑淄博马拉松”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当得知老家办起了马拉松，在青岛读研究生的淄博人贾彦昊意识到，政府对待流量的策略发生转变，从“五一”前后的不主动“拱火”，甚至压热度，变成现在主动传播话题。 “肯定是希望热度持续得久一点。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“五一”的时候，贾彦昊还在读本科，因为抢不到火车票，就没有回家亲身感受全国人民的狂热。暑假回去住了一段时间，还是可以看到很多外地车牌和旅行团。此外他发现，政府已经做了不少基础性工作：改造一些便民市场，翻新市政设施，道路通畅不少，街道变干净了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关键是，有明星来淄博开演唱会了，马拉松也办起来了，热度一波一波，都在接力上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不知是有意为之，还是老天爷眷顾，2023年以来，流量的确比较青睐淄博。 “因为刀郎的那个歌，淄博的蒲松龄故居又火了。”亓锋是土生土长的淄博人，但是他却很少去逛这些景点，不过，本着“优先外地人”的优良传统，他决定还是等热度稍稍过去之后，再去参观。没想到，外地朋友主动找上门来，让他当导游。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蒲松龄故居坐落在一个小村子里，道路狭窄，交通不便，政府连夜施工，修好了路。很快，聊斋故事改编的舞台剧也纷至沓来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“上半年是搞接待吃烧烤，吃吐了。下半年，主要是去旅游景点转。”亓锋说，最近陆陆续续又有外地朋友过来淄博玩，不再是说想吃烧烤，而是点名要去看齐国故都、琉璃博物馆、蒲松龄故居，以及拍摄过电视剧《大染坊》的周村古大街。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这说明，烧烤的热度开始往旅游项目上外溢。他感到一丝欣慰，同时又有一些遗憾。 “淄博毕竟不是传统的旅游城市，没什么好的景点。”他解释，这些景点比较分散，而且不是那种“响当当”的龙头景区，旅游吸引力还是有限。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还是老祖宗不给力，老天爷赏饭也不太能接得住。亓锋说，作为普通市民，他当然是希望淄博的热度停留得越久越好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年6月24日的海月龙宫烧烤体验地，此种盛况国庆能否再现？视觉中国图&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/c267a1149b.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;胡长月说，他们的文创产品以扇子、冰箱贴这些旅游纪念品为主，设计了三大类主题，分别为人间烟火气、齐文化以及聊斋文化。在当时，满大街都是“进淄赶烤”的横幅，焦点都在“淄博烧烤”这四个字上，所以，当时最好卖的一组纪念品是“人间烟火气”，主题和烧烤切合，甚至直接就印着烧烤炉的图案，“一定得有淄博两个字，或者烧烤元素，才好卖”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再后来，琉璃和字画成为了顶流，八大局路边的小摊子上，之前的紫薯饼、炒锅饼，清一色换成了琉璃工艺品和带有字画元素的扇子。胡长月没有觉察到，它们是怎么火起来的，反正就是火了。 “这说明外界开始通过烧烤，了解淄博的文化了。”他说，这一阶段，齐文化这一门类的产品销量嗖嗖飙涨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等到蒲松龄故居火起来的时候，胡长月忽然觉得，上天的确对淄博有所眷顾，热门话题接踵而至，“其实我们政府也挺会的，一个没落，全都接住了”。于是，他们公司的产品，完全承接住了淄博流量曲线各个阶段，打了一场漂亮的突击战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这股浪潮中，也有未能分到一杯羹的怏怏者。 “感觉我的这个东西太超前，淄博烧烤的产业发展还不太能跟得上。”在疫情之前，智能机器人创业者李国华就开发出他的独家产品“烧烤机器人”，2023年“五一”，他还从政府部门申请到一个展位，在烧烤城里展示推销，他觉得机会来了，结果没想到销量惨淡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他自称在2019年，接到国内一家大型连锁餐饮巨头的订单，这家公司计划打造一个烧烤子品牌，让他提供全套的自动化改造方案。于是他开发出烧烤机器人。没想到，赶上三年疫情，烧烤子品牌项目泡汤，他的烧烤机器人也没有了用武之地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李国华意识到，和连锁餐饮巨头比起来，淄博烧烤的行业生态，还处于较为初级的阶段，而自动化设备又过于超前，两者不是很匹配，承接不下淄博的流量。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;八大局摊主：最担心调走领导&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在淄博八大局摆书画摊的李东，反倒是一点也不担心流量会一去不复返。 “很有信心，淄博有的是方式方法，把热度延续下去。”李东举例，马拉松就是政府主动而为，吸引游客来淄博游玩，前不久火爆的聊斋故事，算是蒲松龄故居“被动营业”，淄博机敏地捕捉到这个热点顺势而为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“现在最担心把（政府）领导调走。”李东本来是一个文艺爱好者，平时喜欢写写画画、搞搞收藏，听说政府要在八大局划出一部分摊位，免费提供给市民，但是要优先文化、文创类，他就动了心思，主动申请，凭借深厚的书画造诣，果然通过审核。现在，不仅自己的文艺特长有了发挥余地，每个月还增加不少收入。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;一是和切身利益休戚相关，二是身为淄博人的骄傲，他严格要求自己，过马路不闯红灯了，出门也不乱丢垃圾了，吸完一根烟，烟头一定要找到垃圾桶再丢。 “注意个人素质，那么多外地人看着你呢，可不能给淄博抹黑。”他说，过完“十一”，天慢慢就冷起来，全国各地的旅游景点也都该到了淡季，所以要乘着这个“黄金周”大干一场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;爆火之前，方姐就在八大局开了一家意大利披萨餐厅，马拉松前一天晚餐，她就接待过一位本地的马拉松跑友。方姐说，外地游客来八大局，目的通常很明确，正餐还是以烧烤或者博山菜这样的本地美食为主，所以，意大利餐厅的生意并不直接受影响，不过，身处核心地段，他们还是受到很多益处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自忖为淄博比较有格调的餐厅老板，方姐发现，除了马拉松，淄博的音乐剧、舞台剧之类的文化引流越来越多，所以，“十一”肯定会有一波游客高峰。不过经历过“五一”的洗礼，她现在算是训练有素，不需太过紧张，正常备货，正常开门营业就行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早年间，方姐老公在意大利打工多年，上了年纪之后，回老家开了这家餐厅，平时就两口子配合经营。他俩合计好了，“十一”再辛苦几天，过完这个忙碌的假期，就出去旅旅游。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，到了中秋节那天，披萨店准备打烊歇业。 “赚再多钱也不干，我们要和自己的家人一起过节。”方姐说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[严惩环评造假，按季度对人员异常情况预警]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257756]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/8oXKTbNFgMhVHlddvU8sfkUq8kArMNfR36fFkATn.jpg&quot;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;存在质量问题的环评&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;，&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;一并通报审批部门、评估机构&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;刘志全表示，环评单位在建设项目环评工作中起技术支撑作用，对环评文件内容和结论承担直接责任，在从业中必须依法经营、诚信经营，依靠提供高质量的环评文件赢得市场，“如果有人唯利是图、胆敢以身试法，必将受到法律的严惩”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;环评工程师在环评文件编制中作为编制主持人起着至关重要的作用。刘志全称，涉案环评工程师为了蝇头小利抱着侥幸心理“挂靠”其环评工程师职业资格，越过职业道德底线，也越过了法律的底线，对工作、生活、家庭均造成了难以挽回的严重影响，“所有环评工程师和所有环评从业人员都应当引以为戒，守好环评从业的底线”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;环评法律法规明确规定，建设单位对环评文件的内容和结论负责，应当对建设项目环评文件质量承担主体责任。刘志全称，这警示建设单位务必引起高度重视，优先选择信用良好、符合能力建设指南要求的环评单位，落实主体责任，对环评文件的内容和结论进行审核，“切不可因小失大，以致造成不可挽回的损失，甚至承担严重的法律后果”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘志全还表示，环评审批、评估部门和专家必须严格落实把关责任。对存在质量问题的环评文件通过审批的，一并对审批部门、评估机构及专家予以通报，对属于严重质量问题的，要求依法撤销批复并严格责任追究。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;环评审批数量激增，新能源汽车项目同比增179.5%&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年1-8月份，全国共完成环评审批8.09万个，同比增长13%，涉及总投资14.7万亿元，同比增长9.4%。其中，新能源相关行业迅猛增长。新能源汽车项目218个，同比增长179.5%；风电项目317个，同比增长63.4%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘志全表示，将继续实施环评审批“三本台账”（国家、地方、外资三个层面重大项目环评审批服务清单）和绿色通道机制，会同地方加快审查审批，为重大项目尽快开工创造条件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早在2023年1月17日召开的生态环境部例行新闻发布会上，刘志全就曾表示，将会同发展改革、商务、交通、水利等部门，尽快梳理明确2023年铁路、水利、能源保供、外资等重点推进的项目清单，提前介入指导环评编制，强化生态环保措施，开辟绿色通道提高效率，助力重大项目落地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在本次发布会上，刘志全介绍，2023年，全国基础设施、新能源、环境治理等项目环评审批数量快速增长。上半年，全国审批水利项目环评1642个，同比增长37%；铁路专用线项目29个，数量创历史新高。此外，大气污染治理、固废处置利用等环境治理行业也保持快速增长态势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在重大基础设施项目的环评审批方面，刘志全称，生态环境部审批了交通、能源、水利水电等重大项目环评20个，涉及总投资2600多亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一方面，重大基础设施项目环评审批进度加快。另一方面，生态环保底线也要守牢。刘志全介绍，在交通方面，2023年已审查11个港口、铁路、地铁等规划环评，审批3个项目环评，这些项目绕避了国家级水产种质资源保护区、集中居住区等环境保护目标，有的还采取全封闭声屏障等噪声防治措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在能源方面，2023年已审查15个煤炭矿区规划环评，审批8个重大煤矿项目，它们绕避了国家级公益林、生态保护红线等重要敏感区域，采取了严格的保水采煤、生态修复、矸石矿井水综合利用等措施。 &lt;/p>;

Currently, my daughter is in seventh grade, and the tuition fee is about 30,000 yuan per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in international schools, the higher the grade, the more expensive the tuition is. If the daughter goes to grade 10-12 (equivalent to domestic high school), the cost may rise to RMB 130,000-150,000 per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying reminded that the cost of studying abroad varies from person to person, and developing countries are not synonymous with &quot;cheap&quot;. The order of tuition fees for studying in Malaysia is: private schools >; Chinese schools >; public schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, locals in Malaysia can study for free in government schools, while only those with good family conditions send their children to international schools. &quot;A friend just transferred his child to an American school. Even the school bus costs 1,800 yuan per month.&quot; Liu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from the &quot;private elite&quot; and &quot;direct access to Europe and the United States&quot; routes for middle-class families, there are also families who choose the &quot;niche&quot; education route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MJ4s2ihpFSYpKDPHowbLkLezeKSBQznqPk1TwPxn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MJ4s2ihpFSYpKDPHowbLkLezeKSBQznqPk1TwPxn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252248&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;July 16, 2023 is the Armenian Water Splashing Festival. Haili’s daughter Mu En (first from right) plays with local children. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haili said that the reason for choosing Armenia is that Armenia has low entry threshold. Foreigners do not need to purchase real estate, deposit funds, etc. to apply for a residence permit. On the other hand, compared with the same training programs in China, the education fees here are simply &quot;cabbage prices&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Haili has enrolled her 6-year-old daughter in a number of courses - including figure skating, violin, rhythmic gymnastics, etc. According to her, the monthly group class fees for these courses range from 200 to 400 yuan, and the courses include 8 to 12 classes. If you ask for one-on-one private tutoring, the cost is 100-200 yuan/session. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to the educational &quot;legacy&quot; left by the former Soviet Union, Armenia has rich educational resources and many cultural and sports projects are very strong. Take figure skating as an example. The ice rink where Haili&#39;s daughter learns figure skating attracts figure skaters for training every summer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trusova, who won the runner-up in single figure skating at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, has been here many times, and Haili’s daughter once took a photo with her. The group classes here only cost about 220 yuan per month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If we were in China, we might not even have enough tickets for the ice rink.&quot; Haili said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The most feared thing is&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;sickness and accidents&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;When the decision to study abroad is made, the division of labor among the families accompanying the students is mostly similar - the mother goes abroad to accompany the student while the father stays to earn money. In daily life, most fathers contact their wives and children through Internet phone calls. Only during holidays can the two places get together &quot;flyingly&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the mothers accompanying them, this division of labor is partly because women participate in more family childcare work and have more advantages in taking care of children. On the other hand, it is related to local immigration policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying said that in Malaysia, accompanying visas are only issued to female immediate family members. “So most of the people I see accompanying young international students here are mothers or grandmothers.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a foreign country, the lives of young international students depend entirely on the care of limited elders. Once they get sick or have an accident, the family operation basically stops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years in Malaysia, Liu Ying has met many Chinese mothers who have gone through the same experience, and has also heard many embarrassing stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On one occasion, a mother who was accompanying her to school suffered a burglary at home. &quot;The mother and son were sleeping, and suddenly a knife was placed on their necks.&quot; Although no one was harmed in the aftermath, it caused a considerable psychological shadow on the children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another time, a Chinese mother who was studying with her died suddenly in her apartment at night. The next day when the child was preparing to go to school with others, he was discovered by other Chinese mothers. Liu Ying said that because the father of the child could not enter the country for a while, the funeral arrangements for the deceased mother relied on the help of other Chinese accompanying mothers. After the father&#39;s emergency visa was issued, the child was safely brought back to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The biggest fear for mothers who study abroad is illness and accidents, and a string in their minds is extremely tight. Occasionally, when you return to China, you are more likely to get sick. That’s because the string finally has a chance to loosen. &quot;Liu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving for Canada, Shanghai mother Liangmei brought enough medicine. She said, &quot;I brought all kinds of medicines that I could foresee, such as cold medicines, antibiotics, etc.&quot; Even so, not long after arriving in Canada, Liangmei went to see a doctor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My waist flashed and I always felt uncomfortable. Later, accompanied by my friends, I decided to see a doctor.” Liangmei said that she went to a clinic at that time. &quot;The whole process can be communicated with the doctor in normal language, and it is not as complicated as I imagined.&quot; However, Liangmei is worried that if she encounters a &quot;big trouble&quot; like a child with a fever in the future, she will still feel uneasy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Families who have the conditions will also choose to have their parents study with them at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Zhang Xinhe, a mother from Guangzhou, is engaged in the cosmetics industry in China. Because her child went to study abroad, they also went to Vancouver and Kuala Lumpur to accompany her. Zhang Xin believes that the company of parents is conducive to the growth of children. If only the mother accompanies the child to study, it will not only be detrimental to the growth of the child, but will also cause many family conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, no matter how thorough the accompanying plan is, the many differences between Chinese and Western education will still bring challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xin’s children previously studied in a public school in Vancouver, Canada, with annual tuition fees of about 90,000 yuan. But &quot;there is almost no hardware&quot;: in Zhang Xin&#39;s words, &quot;the school has no protective fences or security guards, and the door is open, making people feel insecure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The local concept of happy education also makes Zhang Xin anxious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the first few months when my child went to school, the teacher had been teaching the ABC letters. After the child came home, I asked her what she did all day, and she said that the teacher kept asking us to play. It rains often in winter in Canada. When it snows, children often have snowball fights on the playground,&quot; Zhang Xin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the influence of many factors, Zhang Xin decided to transfer her child to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to study in a private international school. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“The future is open”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Johor Bahru, Malaysia, Liu Ying’s daughter speaks three languages ​​on a daily basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I speak Chinese at home, English at school, and I need to speak a few words of Malay when I go shopping.” There are also many young international students from South Korea and Japan in local international schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to experience a better English-speaking environment in Toronto, Canada, Liangmei moved her children from the multi-ethnic city center to the suburbs where whites are relatively concentrated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the families interviewed, the young international students generally left China when they were in primary school or junior high school, and their ages ranged from 6 to 13 years old. Before their values ​​and worldview have yet to be formed, it is easier for them to master a new language and experience the collision of different cultures. However, in a &quot;multilingual growing up&quot; environment, you sometimes face unexpected &quot;conflicts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xin said that many young international students in Canada receive English education locally, but when they grow up, they cannot speak Chinese well, &quot;let alone write.&quot; Among the many reasons why Zhang Xin decided to transfer her children to another school, &quot;preventing them from forgetting their mother tongue&quot; was one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the young international students grow up, their future development paths are also put on the agenda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, some families accompanying students would pass the Overseas Chinese Student Joint Entrance Examination to allow their children to return to the mainstream domestic education system and obtain admission to key universities at a lower threshold. However, Liu Ying felt that this path was not easy to follow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We will basically not consider the joint entrance examination for overseas Chinese students, because the possibility of policy changes is quite high.” Liu Ying believes that the era of using studying abroad as a springboard and trying to overtake in corners has passed, and small students Parents of international students also do not let their children study. &quot;I have to pay such a high price to accompany them to study. I don&#39;t want to just get a diploma.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Ying’s daughter is currently in seventh grade in Malaysia, and she has an open mind about her daughter’s future. &quot;Currently, many Chinese in Malaysia and Singapore have immigrated to various parts of the world. They have a more open mind, a broader vision, and are willing to go further. In fact, this is worth learning from us.&quot; Liu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiao Ya hopes that after her son graduates from an American university, he will continue to apply for graduate studies at an American “Ivy League school”. As for the development after graduate school, it is up to my son to decide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Children’s roots are still in China, whether it is cultural roots, emotions, or social ties.” Qiao Ya believes that foreign humanistic environments play a great role in children’s growth (this points also apply to adults). But no matter where they are, children and adults need to gradually mature their minds and stabilize their foundations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Essentially, the world is the same, and there are beautiful places. It depends on how you shape your own life.&quot; Qiao Ya said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/1UXoq3AssTQKjlb96CDRWXJ2xzpTQBjYkZfPom8Y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1257&quot; height= &quot;942&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/1UXoq3AssTQKjlb96CDRWXJ2xzpTQBjYkZfPom8Y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shanghai mother Liangmei said that children&#39;s independence and hands-on ability have been improved by studying and living overseas. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangmei has just arrived in Toronto and has not yet made precise plans for the future of her children. However, she made it clear that she would not force her children to go to prestigious schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also hopes that children can &quot;experience multiculturalism, have a broader vision and strong social practice ability.&quot; Liangmei also pointed out that Canada has a lot of demand for technical and service blue-collar jobs, such as electricians, veterinarians, dental assistants, etc. Blue-collar jobs are equally respectable and pay well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is different from China.

Big attention. On September 26, the Datong City Joint Investigation Team reported that it was confirmed that two 9-year-old male students &quot;repeatedly committed serious bad behaviors such as insults, beatings, and bullying&quot; against another male student in the same dormitory. The offender &quot;will be reprimanded in accordance with the law and ordered to receive psychological counseling and behavioral modification&quot;, and his or her guardian &quot;will be reprimanded and ordered to receive family education guidance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This official notification did not calm public opinion, but instead caused greater controversy, because the punishment for the two bullies was too light, and it was not even a punishment at all. The vague statement in the official report that &quot;repeatedly committed insults, beatings, bullying and other serious bad behaviors&quot; is actually so shocking that even adults can&#39;t imagine it. It is difficult to recount, but I can only say that in addition to long-term insults and beatings, it also included serious personal insults and sexual assaults. If these acts were committed by adults, they would undoubtedly constitute the crime of child molestation. Given the severity of the circumstances and the severity of the impact, they would likely be sentenced to the fullest possible sentence. If the victim is a girl, it is a crime of rape of a young girl, and the death penalty may not be an exaggeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference in punishment caused by the age difference between the perpetrators has been a matter of widespread public concern for a long time. Two little boys committed such serious crimes, but because they were only 9 years old, their punishment could only be &quot;admonishment, forced psychological counseling and behavioral modification.&quot; How can such a painless treatment comfort the victims? This is unacceptable to the public. However, according to a well-known police influencer, &quot;At this age, it really can only be like this.&quot; Is the law really powerless against young devils? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the purpose of &quot;protecting minors&quot;, China&#39;s criminal law does stipulate that minors under a certain age who commit crimes will not be held criminally responsible. Before the 11th Amendment to the Criminal Law comes into effect, minors who are over 14 years old and under 16 years old are only required to bear criminal responsibility when they commit eight serious crimes. Those under 14 years old are not criminally responsible for any crime they commit. . Even though the Criminal Law Amendment (11) stipulates that those who are over 12 years old but under 14 years old can be held criminally responsible for intentional homicide or intentional injury if the circumstances are serious and the impact is serious, but those under 12 years old are still absolutely exempt from criminal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the previous criminal law also stipulated that those who are not subject to criminal punishment due to age can, in addition to ordering their guardians to discipline them, also be &quot;cused and educated by the government&quot; when necessary. In 2019, after the C&amp;E system was abolished, the new criminal law changed this to &quot;specialized correctional education in accordance with the law.&quot; The new law on the prevention of juvenile delinquency makes specific provisions on this type of specialized correctional education: If a minor commits an act stipulated in the criminal law and is not subject to criminal punishment because he is under the legal age of criminal responsibility, the education administration shall, upon evaluation and approval by the Specialized Education Steering Committee, The department, together with the public security organ, may decide to provide special correctional education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;specialized correctional education&quot; here is compulsory. It only requires the evaluation and approval of the Specialized Education Steering Committee and is decided by the education administration department in conjunction with the public security agency. It does not require the consent of the guardian. The objects of this type of specialized correctional education, even in specialized schools, must receive education in &quot;specialized places.&quot; This specialized place must &quot;implement closed-loop management. The public security organs and judicial administrative departments are responsible for the correction of minors. The education administrative department shall be responsible for the education of minors.” There is no age limit for the subjects of this kind of specialized correctional education, and there is no &quot;no less than 12 years old&quot; rule mentioned by the aforementioned big V. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, there are no legal provisions for the treatment of young serious offenders. Although being sent to a specialized school for correctional education is not a criminal punishment, it is at least much stronger than indifferent treatments such as &quot;reprimands and orders to undergo behavior modification.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in reality, these legal provisions are rarely applied. The first reason is that there are few specialized schools, and the second reason is that most places have not yet established corresponding departments and procedures. According to research data from the Ninth Procuratorate of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, which is responsible for the prosecution of minors, as early as 2019, the central government proposed that &quot;local governments at or above the county level should reasonably set up specialized schools according to needs.&quot; However, as of May 2022, there are only There are more than 110 schools, and 9 provinces have no specialized schools, and many provinces and even the most populous provinces only have one specialized school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are many minors who need to receive such &quot;specialized correctional education&quot;. According to data from the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, in 2021, procuratorial organs in various regions, in collaboration with relevant departments, sent 2,159 minors who had committed crimes to vocational schools for correctional education. Hainan Daily also reported a few days ago that 4 specialized schools have been built in Hainan province, and have admitted 276 students in the first eight months of 2023 (the report did not specify how many of these students were forced to receive specialized correctional education in accordance with the law). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient places and institutions have left many delinquent minors who should have been forced to receive &quot;specialized correctional education&quot; nowhere to be sent. They can only be &quot;reprimanded&quot; and then let go. This may allow some minors to regard the Minors Protection Law as a talisman and engage in illegal and criminal activities without restraint: they will not be severely punished anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to providing powerful &quot;special corrective education&quot; for minors who have committed crimes, their guardians should also pay a greater price for poor education. For example, the amount of “mental damage compensation” in current Chinese legal practice is too low and has been criticized. Judicial practice should greatly increase the upper limit of the amount of mental damage compensation. On the one hand, this can better compensate the victims, and on the other hand, it can also improve the deterrence of illegal crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the protection of minors is not the protection of minors from crime. Only by severely punishing and dealing with minors who break the law and commit crimes can we better reduce minors&#39; violations and crimes and protect more minors. The compulsory specialized correctional education system should be implemented as soon as possible and implemented effectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为了避世、高考、不流浪……：在鹤岗买房的人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257724]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
